"Your absent father can really mess you up, ladies.

Another winner from Tana French."
"Another great book for the Dublin Murder Squad series!

The Trespasser is the 6th book in this series and I was captivated from the start. The murder case, the characters and overall feel of this book had me sucked in from the beginning.

The main detective characters of Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran were complex, unique and had their own personalities.
Antoinette was a tough woman who didn’t pull any punches when it came to the sexism she encountered in the Murder Detective Unit. The harassment has turned her paranoid so she’s on a fine line of losing her edge. Who’s really against her and is the story that she’s created in her mind all facts?

The domestic murder that Detectives Conway and Moran get sent to ends up being more then what they bargained for. The murder victim, Aislinn Murray was expecting company, possible a date. What the detectives end up finding at the scene is a beautiful, dead woman, a clean apartment and too many secrets. Is Aislinn really a beautiful, passive doll that she appears to be?

I enjoyed the setting of Dublin like always and the police procedure in this book is well done. Tana French seems to understand the police culture and writes it well! I really hope she keeps writing books for this series or does something new in the future.
I’ve missed reading her books in the last few years!

If you want a complex and intense new detective series, look no further than the Dublin Murder Squad. You won’t be disappointed in my opinion!"
"

This was SO GOOD. In terms of plot and character development, it reminded me a lot of another book in the series - 
Faithful Place - because it's so heavily dependent on 
the slow psychological reveal. Even though you learn the identity of the murderer with 100 pages left, I was riveted. Those last 100 pages are somehow the most interesting part of the book, and I loved the ending conversation between O'Kelly and McCann. Tana French's great talent is making interesting and compelling mysteries fit the identity of the lead detective in a believable and gut-wrenching way, and this one is no exception. I love Antoinette and Steve as partners, and Antoinette's own self-discovery over the course of the case makes the ending so satisfying. The only question is - WHEN IS THE NEXT BOOK COMING OUT??"
"Well Tana French has robbed me of another night of sleep- finished it near midnight, now am so wired on post-wonderful- book high I'll never get to sleep.

...Ah, well. I suppose I'll just read the news eventually. That should make me want to go to sleep pretty quick!"
"This being my 4th Tana French read, I can safely say that the Dublin Murder Squad is becoming one of my all time favorite detective series. French revels in making her readers wait for the big reveal, so the pace can only be described as a slow burn and when her detectives interrogate the dialogue unfolds in such a creative way.

At first glance, Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran don't seem to have a stirring case. Their victim's life actually appears to be a bit boring and all they have is one suspect. But as their investigation continues, they wonder just how close their killer really is.

I was completely swept away by this unputdownable crime fiction."
"
The Trespasser is absolutely gripping tale. Probably my favourite French by now. There is not much action here. We spend a lot of time at police station what only deepens feeling of claustrophobia and being lost. There is a murder of young woman and probable perpetrator. And too willing, to my liking, policeman to call it a day. And feisty and rebellious, due to earlier experience somewhat paranoid, kind of black sheep in the murder squad, Antoinette Conway. The girl who is not that easy to seal the fate of hapless man.

It’s a psychological thriller, everything that occurred to main protagonists had its roots in the past. Not only a victim had her secrets. Everyone seems to hide one’s intentions and motivations, play a double game. But it’s not cheap and sentimental claptrap. French is too smart for that. I weren’t that impressed with her debut novel In the woods and though I quite liked it nonetheless there were too many things that left me irritated and disappointed. But Tana French definitely learned her lesson. She used the same scheme here, two policemen, woman and man, both more or less tried by life, but what In the woods felt infantile and unbearably mawkish here brought anger and energy and power. French created very atmospheric police procedural albeit not entirely improved my belief that police is to protect and serve.

4,5/5"
"Tana French's brilliant dialogue and insightful characters always make for a intense read and her latest Dublin Murder Squad ""The Trespasser"" is no exception. If you are unfamiliar with the series, I suggest you start with her ""In the Woods"" and then read them in order. She is a fascinating author who is on top of her game.
""The Trespasser"" is back with the characters of Detective Antoinette Conway and Detective Stephen Moran from ""The Secret Place."" (Dublin Murder Squad #5) They are a odd match for a pair of detectives, she is angry, abusive and unfriendly and he wants to be the nice guy. Despite their differences, they are a wonderful pair of ""friends""/ colleagues who care for each other and their murder cases. The author is at her best dissecting relationships and that is one of the joys of reading her books. She gets under the skin of the majority of her characters and they are never just one-dimensional. It is a nice change for this reader who gets bored and annoyed if the characters are too predictable.
I gave this book four stars and would recommend if you like well-written murder mysteries."
"Review originally published at Nudge.

In a market saturated with identikit thrillers, Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books stand out. They unequivocally and unashamedly belong to the crime genre, but they are written with an attention to detail and crafting of character that (rightly or wrongly) is more usually associated with literary fiction. Equally remarkably, this is a series of books – The Trespasser is the sixth – that actually gets better with every new instalment. And there's something about a really good crime novel, isn't there? I've read plenty of gripping books in the last few months, but The Trespasser is the only one that's made my commute whip by as though it was a couple of minutes, and the only one I've sat reading in a café for hours, racing through hundreds of pages until it turned dark outside.

For the uninitiated: the Dublin Murder Squad novels are tangentially linked, but each has a standalone plot, and they don't have to be read in order. The narrator here, murder detective Antoinette Conway, was a minor player in the last book. Her character is typical of the sort of protagonist French employs to fantastic effect. Conway (as she is invariably known) is hard as nails with a soft centre buried beneath a thousand abrasive layers, and narrates in a voice that switches between tough and lyrical.

French's stories are neither whodunnits nor whydunnits; above all, they're about the process of getting to the truth. In The Trespasser, the victim is a young woman, found dead in her home. It looks like the result of domestic violence, and the solution seems obvious: the new boyfriend did it. Then inconsistencies start to crop up, and the investigation turns into a hall-of-mirrors game between Conway and the rest of her squad, laced with paranoia and doubt.

To say more would ruin the pleasure of the plot's many swerves and feints – but it's also worth noting that, as utterly compelling as The Trespasser is, it's just as effective a character piece as it is a crime thriller. Conway's determination is perfectly evoked, as is her vulnerability. You're drawn into her narrative so completely that you feel what the character feels. Conway can't stand the wimpy prime suspect, even though he probably didn't do it, so you can't stand him either; Conway's caustic voice seeps into your own internal monologue. She's a brilliant creation, strong enough to carry this 500-page story along even when it threatens to lapse into repetitiveness.

The Trespasser isn't flawless – its resolution hinges on a stratagem of unlikely complexity – and for my money, it doesn't quite match the luminous originality of the previous couple of books in the series (Broken Harbour and The Secret Place). But it is a bloody good crime novel, it is absolutely engrossing, and it has a protagonist you won't forget in a hurry. I can't wait for the next one.

I received an advance review copy of The Trespasser from Nudge. I wasn't paid for this review and I was under no obligation to be anything other than honest about what I thought of the book.

Additional notes re: reservations, with copious spoilers...


Okay, so: the sheer scale and complexity of Aislinn's 'plan' is hard to swallow. French is at pains to make her backstory sympathetic, but really she'd have to be a sociopath to pull it off. Rory's 'story' about someone stalking Aislinn is so ridiculous, and so clearly implicates him, that it's difficult to believe he'd come out with it. (Similarly, the amount of detail in Lucy's confession is unlikely.) Rory in general is an unbelievable character; yeah, he's meant to be a dreamy geek because he owns a bookshop, but he would have to be business-minded to ever have set up and kept running the place single-handed; he couldn't have his head in the clouds this much, or be this useless.

And there's the fact that more than half the book is Conway and Moran coming up with ideas, chasing them, and turning out to be wrong. Time and time again Conway in particular is so sure she's right about something, then isn't. Hundreds of pages are eaten up by little more than this. But the magic of Tana French lies in the way she makes the story utterly fascinating anyway. She did the same thing with The Secret Place: as I wrote in my review at the time, on one level it's just 'a 500-page book about teenage girls fighting over an arrogant and predictably sex-crazed teenage boy'. The Trespasser is a 500-page book about a detective being paranoid and getting things wrong, repeatedly. But both stories are so much more than that – more than the sum of their parts. Both keep you absolutely mesmerised until it's all over.

On a non-spoilerish note, once you've read more than two of French's books it becomes evident that her narrative style is always very similar despite the fact that she uses a new narrator each time. The same take-no-shit toughness blended with a penchant for poetic descriptions. Loads of swearing, loads of slang, but sudden bursts of lyricism. Luckily for her, it's a very effective style and she's brilliant at hitting exactly the right notes."
"This is my Book Of the Month- November 2016, with GR group- Nothing But Reading Challenges- Category: Anything Goes BOM.

I am a huge fan of this series and have read all the previous 5 books. I have been eagerly waiting for the sixth book and was extremely delighted when I got my hands on it.

Based on my previous experience I knew I am going to come across various shades of human emotion and behavior and I wasn't disappointed!!

The main protagonist in this story is Detective Antoinette Conway and we experience everything as she does. She was first introduced in The Secret Place. In that book she came of as a really strong personality and I really wanted to read something from her point of view.

But then nothing in French's book is as expected and we get to see a different facet of Antoinette's personality than we know. I felt she is really insecure and paranoid at times but is something really there or is it all just her imagination?

Then we have her partner Stephen Moran who was first introduced in Faithful Place. Both the investigating Detectives are rather struggling to make a place in the Murder Squad.
""The real reason everyone hates night shift is that nothing good ever comes in. The high-profile murder with complex back-stories and fascinating motives might happen at night, sometimes, but they don't get discovered till morning. The only murders that get noticed at night are by the drunk arseholes whose motive is that they're drunk arseholes.""

There is a murder that they are investigating and there are rather wild theories flying around...
""The idea is annoying me: us, two grown-ass professional Ds, chasing some idiot's Nancy Drew fantasy all around town."" -- I was happy that this was addressed as some of the theories sounded too far-fetched to me!

The murder mystery at it's core is really simple and I was able to guess the culprit but its the how and why that surprised me.
Nothing is ever as simple in this series as you may want it to be...
""You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumple that.""

Overall a must read but I strongly advice to read this series in it's order to get the most out of it."
"""The case comes in, or anyway it comes in to us, on a frozen dawn in the kind of closed-down January that makes you think the sun's never going to drag itself back above the horizon."" pg 1, ebook.

And so begins the final book (so far) in Tana French's masterful Dublin Murder Squad series. This entry follows Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran, the duo readers met in the last book, as they try to solve, what at first appears to be, a simple domestic disturbance. Little do they know, what they discover will challenge all of their assumptions about their roles in the Murder Squad and their own investigative skills.

""Before we check out the rest of the cottage, I squat down by the body and carefully, one-fingered, hook back her hair from her face. Steve moves in beside me. Every Murder D I've ever known does it: takes one long look at the victim's face."" pg 24

The investigation, especially the interrogation scenes, are intense and what I've come to expect from this series. It's a thrilling who-done-it with complex characters and relationships. I really enjoyed it.

""The pressure level means Murder is balanced so finely that it only takes a few new heads to shift the whole feel of the squad: turn that big cat rogue and edgy, set that rifle warping towards its moment to blow up in your face."" pg 23, ebook

Conway, the only woman on the murder squad, feels as if she has been singled out and shut out of the camaraderie of the rest of the group. So, she feels like she has more to prove when the investigation becomes more complex than she expected.

Conway, the narrator this time around (they change in each book), isn't my favorite character, but she's someone I'd respect and give plenty of space so I didn't come into her crosshairs.

""Unless I missed your promotion, we're on the same squad, and this is my investigation. Which means you're the cheeky little bollix who's getting above himself, and you're the one who needs to bear in mind who's who here."" pg 138, ebook.

Frankly, I'm sorry I've read the final book French has written for the murder squad. However, in a May 2019 interview, she didn't dismiss the idea of writing another book for the series at some point in the future. So, readers can rejoice!

It's just not written yet. Sigh.

Highly recommended for fans of thrillers and mysteries."
"Ms. French continues to impress me with each subsequent book I read in this series. Her ability to take you right into the time, place, and most especially, the characters of her stories is nothing short of astonishing. However, sometimes that very brilliance can make it tough for me in reading her books.

When I finished this *several days ago*, I felt kind of like I did at the end of Faithful Place. Absolutely incredible plot, writing, characterizations, fabulous narration. Did I enjoy it? No, not really. In the sense that reading it, living those lives, spending time with those sometimes awful people, it was damn exhausting. Mentally and emotionally. That was kind of where this one left me.

I liked both Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran when I met them in The Secret Place, though it was Steve telling the story there. In this book, Antoinette takes the lead, and it wasn't exactly easy spending so much time in such an angry person's head. Granted, she had plenty to be angry about. As the only woman in an all otherwise male murder squad, it's made more than clear she isn't welcome. Getting through her day to day while making ignoring all the shite pointed her way look effortless costs her plenty. Antoinette is tough, smart and stubborn but she's also kind of abrasive and is suspicious of everyone's motives for everything.

The case that gets handed to Steve and Antoinette on their way out of a long night shift seems open and shut. Only, the obvious answer that falls right into their laps just doesn't twitch right for either of them. The further into their investigation they go, weird, improbable angles turn up that they really should discount. But, they keep turning up. And nothing makes Antoinette look harder at something than someone else trying to turn her in another direction.

I really like Steve here. This case seems to bring up a lot of old hurts for Antoinette, which only serves to make her even more harsh than normal. But Steve doesn't let her sometimes cutting attitude bother him *much* and his easygoing, unflappable manner seems to be one of the few things that can reel her in. Though often Antoinette's caustic comebacks are more then justified. Still, Steve is always there to back her up when she needs him, and she needs that more than she would ever admit to anyone, even herself. Especially to herself.

When they get to truth at the end of the case, it isn't what anyone thought it would be. 
Though at least Breslin was guaranteed to get his, one way or another. I think I disliked him even more than Frank Mackey. Though the resolution was actually a little sad in my opinion, 
both in what Ashlinn did and in what was done to her the end left both Antoinette and Steve in a better place.

I have to give mad props to the narrator, Hilda Fay. She's a new reader for me but she was genuinely phenomenal!

While I'm sorry this is the end of the series, I'm looking forward to reading everything I can from Tana French."
"4.5/5 stars. This book is truly, deeply incredible. Vivid language, rich characterization, and an ultra-compelling central crime. I absolutely loved every page of this read. It has elevated the typical procedural to new heights. It's important to note that this is a denser book -- it's not the right choice if you want a binge-read. (Unless you have a lot of time on your hands!! ;) ) But seriously, this is an EXCEPTIONAL book. I love it deeply. "
"4.5 stars

I never realised before how you would need the squad to be part of you, close and reliable as your own body, in order to survive it.

-Conway

Thirty-two year-old Detective Garda Antoinette Conway took the lead in this installment and demonstrated exactly how difficult her life was as the only female detective in her unit. I didn’t think I would like Conway much but she grew on me. She had good reasons to be paranoid, defensive, and on edge. Her work environment was toxic and designed to flush her out! I hated the isolated and volatile working conditions her co-workers created, but she also contributed to some of those problems. Either way, I loved that Conway didn’t give up or cave in.




Sure, she felt like she worked in a pressure cooker, but Conway would leave on her own terms before anyone could ever intimidate her out of leaving Murder.

▣ This story spun me in circles!




There were stories within stories!




Detective Garda Stephen Moran started to drive me crazy with all of his fairytale chatter but I loved how in sync he was (eventually) with Conway. There was so much wrapped up within the plot and I never could’ve predicted all the backstabbing, partial truths, hidden agendas, omitted words, and foolish rivalries would lead to that ending! Who knew O’Neill had a soul after all?!!

▣ The major drawback of this book? The PACING! I didn’t think I’d ever get to the end of the book with all of those new stories/perspectives/tales being spun and retold!




▣ Still, this was a worthwhile read! Loved the characterization, loved hating the bad guys, and loved this author’s writing style. Enjoyed!

"How Tana got her groove back.

Tana French and I haven't always gotten along. She gobsmacked me (and nearly everyone else) with IN THE WOODS. It wasn't merely good, it was an eye-opener that seemed to change the rules for thrillers and to open up new possibilities.

I thought THE LIKENESS was worthwhile, but after that her Dublin Murder Squad went through a lean spell for me. The following books seemed too clever by half -- too much style, too little substance. Character development was lacking. Her books were starting to feel formulaic, like she was just going through the motions.

Maybe it's the female narrator that made the difference here. This is a more nuanced, sophisticated book than any she's written in years. The characters feel real; the dialogue pops; there's heart at the core of this novel. Whatever it is, she's returned with a smart, confident thriller with great pacing.

With THE TRESPASSER, she's back to the top of her game . . . or as close as she's likely to get. (That first book was so damn good that it's probably an unfair standard.)

Thoroughly enjoyable. Well played, Tana."
"You know an author has an established reputation when her name appears on the dust jacket in larger type than the title of the book & here it’s appropriate: you’ll read The Trespasser because it is by Tana French, not for the characters or relationships. Our narrator is Antoinette Conway, whom we’ve already met in The Secret Place. As we expect, she continues to be exceedingly unpleasant & to excel @ playing the bullying interviewer. When she uses her ‘good cop’ routine, she calls it her ‘Cool Girl’ persona - it’s the only evidence in the story that she’s ever read a book BTW). Stephen Moran, the sympathetic & humane member of their team, makes his third appearance. Conway simply uses the letter D to indicate ‘detective’ (too lazy to spell it out apparently) tho’ the way most the male members (sorry, couldn’t resist!) of the squad behave, I kept thinking of another word. Which fits Conway; she’s a total potty mouth. (Still trying to figure out if there’s a semantic difference between ‘shit’ & ‘shite’ in Irish usage.) But tho’ Conway lacks a soul, I admired her more than ‘Scorcher’ Kennedy of Broken Harbour, perhaps because unlike Broken Harbour, The Trespasser offers a villain who deserves an avenging Fury for a D.

A sign of an excellent author is that her lesser works cast new light on her best, & that was true for me here. As in The Likeness, we have the victim - here Aislinn Murray - as the most interesting character. That made me rethink The Likeness. I’d thought Cassie Maddox was my favourite of French’s characters (& she is in In the Woods) but now I believe that who I really loved was not Cassie Maddox herself, but Cassie Maddox performing Lexie Madison. In The Trespasser it is the victim herself who goes undercover, giving herself a total makeover in order to accomplish a goal that may seem an obsession & she puts herself into the role even more completely than Cassie. Ironically it is surrendering to her true self & true love that precipitates Aislinn’s murder. I also like Aislinn’s friend Lucy in a supporting role as confidante.

But whilst you’d not read The Trespasser for attractive characters, it is beautifully plotted. As in other of Tana French’s novels, you’ll get bit tired of chasing red herrings If you’re an experienced reader you’ll spot them. (You’ve also learned never to co-operate with the interrogators; they’re out to stitch you up & don’t care who did it so long as they get their solves.) It’s not perfect - there’s a subplot involving Antoinette’s father I found distracting - yet the last third of the book when everything starts fitting together is utterly unputdownable. And I was pleased by the discovery of the villain whom I quite despised, unlike in some other of Tana French’s novels where I would have let them get away with it.

The Trespasser is the sixth in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I rank them, in decreasing order as follows: The Likeness & The Secret Place in a virtual tie for 1st, both tragic & poignant with beautiful relationships, but with the presence of Cassie as narrator perhaps making the difference. Then In the Woods, especially for Cassie tho’ Rob is such a total mess I cannot bring myself to read it again. Followed by Faithful Place; Frank is an excellent & attractive character but his father & mother are utterly repulsive for me. Then I’d place this one, with Broken Harbour last, but still a solid four star. What to give The Trespasser? I’d give it five stars for plot but Conway’s potty mouth effectively forestalls reading it again & costs one star.



"
"Now I am a Tana French fan. And keen to read the rest of the Murder Squad series.
I can certainly appreciate the 'crap' she received from peer male officers. I got a double wammy: being a single parent and a single woman.
I really enjoyed everything about the book except the bad language. I was spared that: NZ men do not use foul language or even bad euphemisms in front of a woman.
The McCann and the Breslin characters I can relate too. There us always at least one person in every organisation I worked for while think they are smarter than everyone else.
Unputdownable."
Man I love Tana French. Kept me til the very last page. Watch my full review: https://youtu.be/S5g_4NSU_OA
"Another solid addition to the Dublin Murder Squad Series. I think this is actually one of my least favorite of the series, since I really didn't care about the mystery aspect as much and never felt that personal connection to the main detective as I did with others in the series. But I still loved it, so that says a lot about this series. I'm sad that for now there are no new books in this series on the horizon but I'm looking forward to reading her new standalone novel soon!"
"What makes Irish writer Tana French so engaging to me is that she combines crime fiction with literary fiction to = mainstream appeal with thematic purpose. I admit, her first two books, IN THE WOODS and The LIKENESS are still my favorites, mainly because of the haunting, elegiac atmospherics that bump up against contemporary issues and pop culture. This one, her latest with Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran as partnered detectives, concerns a young woman, Aislinn Murray, killed in her apartment, not far from where Conway lives. The new beau, Rory, is a prime suspect.

Conway suspects that if she doesn't solve this one, she is out of the Murder squad. It's her first big case as lead detective, but, for the most part, she has been razzed and dumped on--the only female on the Dublin Murder Squad, and she's also forceful and assertive, something that doesn't go over well with some of the other detectives. She feels that this case could set things right for her. Conway's worries about her job is part of the book's suspense.

As French often does, the question of family and relationships factor in to the motif and the murder case at hand, although at a remove that is handled with care. In the prologue, Conway is remembering how her mother spun quite some yarns about Antoinette’s absent father (an Egyptian prince! A Brazilian guitarist!), so that she never learned the truth about him. This recalled the theme about fathers in THE LIKENESS, and the pain that a daughter suffers in the fallout. In THE TRESPASSER, French explores this, and also casts characters that are willing to mold their lives around the fantasies of others.

Tana Fans (including myself) do not want a review with a blow-by-blow of what happens—the anticipation and coming into it cold bring the warmth to our viscera as the pages turn and we get deeper and more fully into the story. In this, we are thoroughly in Conway’s head, and her thoughts, feelings, and actions are all happening NOW and in the present or immediate past. Usually, it works, but it also has some limiting features, such as weighing it down with exposition. I missed the atmospherics that French has done so well in the past. And there was no opportunity to infer because Conway generally beat me to the punch. Too, we know that Conway is a reliable narrator; she may have a few momentary thinking errors, or doubts, but we are privy to those. The tension, essentially, isn’t commanding. But we care about Conway, and her partnership with Moran, and we come to care about the victim, through other characters.

If you are a Tana French aficionado, this is a must-read. If this is your first visit to the author, go back and read IN THE WOODS, also, for a memorable and eerie murder mystery. THE TRESPASSER may not be French’s best effort, but the provocative theme will register and resonate with anyone who is inclined to live inside the stories of others. The sense of possibility that both salvages and traps you--the frenzy for the story and all its prospects. How hard it is to beat the fantasy, to make yourself into a revision. It's lonely, exciting, impossible, and defining.

Thank you to the publisher for sending me a finished, hardback copy!"
"I really did not want to read this last installment (for now) of Tana French's series, but I just could not stop myself. Unfortunately that means that I now have to wait for her to publish her next one before I can immerse myself in her special brand of brilliance. As with all the other books in the series, I enjoyed the individual characters, but in The Trespasser we get a more intense look at the murder squad as an entity - the role of partnerships and personalities etc. Once again I was amazed by her descriptions of interviews, and the thought processes and motivations behind the questions. All that said, I correctly guessed the outcome at 36%, which had me wondering why Moran and Conway took so long. It also lacked that eerie undertone that most of the other books have. Definitely still worth the read, her crime fictions falls into a category of it's own."
"[9/10]

Even when you know trained chimps could do your job that day, the walk to the scene gets you: turns you into a gladiator walking towards the arena, a few heartbeats away from a fight that’ll make emperors chant your name. Then you take a look at the scene, your arena and your emperor go up in smoke, and you feel shittier than ever.

Antoinette Conway has the killer instinct and the ruthlessness to get the job done. She worked hard to get a job on the best team of detectives in Dublin. The Murder Squad members are for her the A-List of Hollywood stars, but in the two years since she transferred from Missing Persons, detective Conway has become bitter and disillusioned. As the only woman on the squad, she rejects the casual bullying, the bros culture and the sexual innuendo that is heaped on her desk every day. Conway’s response is to directly confront her bullies or to pretend they don’t exist, putting on a hard shell of professional conduct that only results in more isolation and more sneaky, vicious attacks from those who are supposed to be her colleagues. It also results in her boss hesitating to assign Conway to the interesting cases, leaving her and her partner Stephen Moran to do the hard, thankless tasks, like the night shift on weekends, dealing with drunken brawlers instead of going after the top predators.

That pulse is hammering right through me, practically lifting me off the bench. Forget coffee; this job, when it’s right, this job is the hit that speed freaks throw their lives away hunting.

Be careful what you wish for, though. Conway and Moran are finally assigned to a murder case, probably because they were in the squad room after yet another night shift, and jump to it like a couple of big game hunters. But is this the long awaited interesting killer or simply a ‘domestic’ case of abuse and murder of a young woman by the boyfriend she had invited over for dinner? Are the two starved for success detectives building sandcastles out of thin air, or is this truly the work of a master criminal?

Me and Steve have been wanting an interesting case. This could be a lot more interesting than we bargained for.

The boss is putting pressure on them to close the case quickly, including putting a more experienced detective on their team to supervise them and to help with interviewing witnesses. Someone is leaking information to the yellow press and the sabotage of Conway’s work continues unabated. Someone appears to be stalking the detective in her own apartment.
The hunter instinct of the true detective tells Antoinette Conway that something is fishy about the whole setup: the crime scene has been carefully wiped of prints and other physical evidence and a key witness appears either to be lying or to hint at a mysterious liaison for the victim, a young woman of modest means who made herself into a grown-up Barbie Doll.
To complicate matters even further, Conway has a photographic memory and is certain she has seen and talked to this girl named Aislinn in the past.

>>><<<>>><<<

If this was the first novel from Tana French that I read, I would not hesitate to give it five stars. As it stands, I have become a little jaded about the way she builds up the story and the characters, but I am still amazed at the literary skill and the depth of psychological observations, at the way the pace seems extremely slow, even boring until the final pages, then she lets off with the big guns, putting all the previous small clues into perspective and ramping up the emotional involvement of the detectives [and the reader] in the case.

‘The Trespasser’ is a bit unusual in the series since it follows the same two detectives from the previous novel: Conway and Moran. But the main narrator, the focus this time, is on Antoinette Conway, and on how her personal family history and her personal issues with the other members of the Squad affect her work. In the previous novel we got into the head of the ambitious Stephen Moran as he tries to manipulate Conway into putting him on the Murder Squad. This time we see Stephen through the eyes of his partner and we are allowed in turn to find out why she is such a hard b_tch on the job.
The novel is still constructed as a stand-alone police procedural, and there is no need to read the others in the series in advance.

I liked how the case is presented here in terms of hunter and hunted, as a dangerous chase to catch a predator where the detectives must be as devious and as ruthless as their prey, trying to outsmart the killer and push him or her over the edge through riveting interviews with suspects and witnesses. I might disagree with some of the principles that allow the detectives to lie on the job in order to get results, but in this particular case I tend to agree with that TV Dr. House: Everybody lies!

I’m loving this chase, every second of it. I don’t give a damn whether that means I’m a bad person. But I know if we actually catch what we’re hunting, it’s probably gonna rip our faces off.

As I have come to expect from a Tana French novel, the case is always tied somehow to childhood trauma and to long repressed memories. Family comes into play, both on the detective side and on the victim’s part. Sometimes we find out that the detective is also directly linked to the victim and had a role to play in the outcome.
Without entering spoiler territory, it appears that both Antoinette and Aislinn have been abandoned by their fathers, and that childhood event had been the main motivation in their later careers.

She said look what it does to you, falling in love. Just look. It means someone else has hold of your whole life. At any second, like that – snaps her fingers – they could decide to change it into something else. You might never know why. And you might never get it back, your life. They could just walk out and take it with them, and it’s gone for good.

Another constant in the Tana French books is that secrets fester over the years and go lethal. Family is once again front and center in the character’s profile, who unfortunately deal with the lies either by denial or by fantasies. Did Aislinn somehow invite her own murderer into her life? Did Antoinette somehow invite the cruel bullying she is subjected to in the incident room? What are the things they hide in the most secret corners of their hearts?

This idea is annoying me: us, two grown-ass professional Ds, chasing some idiot’s Nancy Drew fantasy all around town. My job is dealing with stories that actually happen, getting them by the scruff of the neck and hauling them clawing and biting to the right ending. Stories that only happened inside someone’s pretty little head, floating bits of white fluff that I’ve got no way to grab hold of: those aren’t supposed to be my problem.

I may have been occasionally bored by the lengthy interviews with witnesses and far-fetched conspiracy theories that seemed to drive the plot forward at a leisurely pace, despite the pressure from the boss to close the case. I even felt the way the clues were revealed to be contrived, fit around the way the author wanted the plot to go [one key witness is left alone until the final chapters]. But I felt compensated by the turbulent revelations at the end, by the manner those secret chambers that we try so hard to keep closed are forced to open and are brought into the light. The predator is finally led into the trap prepared by the detectives, and even the detectives will learn a needed lesson about themselves through the chase.

The squad I’ve spent the last two years hating, the mob of sniggering fucktards backstabbing the solo warrior while she gallantly fought her doomed battle: that’s gone, peeled away like a smeared film that was stuck down hard over the real thing. The squad I would’ve chopped off an arm to join, the shining line of ass-kicking superheroes, that went a long time ago.
What’s left underneath is smaller than either, quieter and more complicated, done in finer detail.

I hope this will not prove to be the last episode in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Tana French has not exhausted the premise, and I look forward to find out what twisted tale she will invent next.

"This book was this months choice for my Mystery Book Club and I chose it. Tana French is one of my favorite writers and I have read most of her books. This one was a little challenge to me because it was very long and the chapters were very long and I did not remember that from previous books. But I did like the story and enjoy the characters and by the end of the book I had begun to understand it and liked the way it ended. I figured out something about the book when I was watching local news here in ATL where I live, where there is also crime every day on local news. The story and the author want to give us an inside view of what the police go through when they're investigating a murder crime and this one does a very good job. They go through so much detail and we never see or hear any of this on the news. So I thought this book was very good at showing us this. I enjoyed the story and was happy with the ending and the fact that the detectives found out everything that was going on in their background. Definitely looking forward to reading more books by Tana French."
"This is why Tana French is such a superb writer. I can't stand her major character, Antoinette Conway, a bitchy, argumentative, foul-mouthed detective with the Murder Squad but I love the book. It takes a darned good author to keep a reader interested when the main player is a pain in the butt. It certainly is no fun being a woman in an all male police squad but Detective Conway takes it just a bit far while trying to hold her own. She is a smart detective but makes me want to punch her in the nose.

This book starts with something that appears to be a possible manslaughter case but soon develops into something much more complex. The suspected perpetrator certainly fits the bill as a rejected lover who loses his temper and accidentally kills his would-be girlfriend. But something doesn't seem quite right to Conway and her partner Steve Moran, as a couple of the veteran detectives of the Murder Squad seem determined to put this case on ice and railroad the suspect. Lots of red herrings and wild guesses before the answer becomes clear. And it is a dandy. A good read indeed."
"I received a review copy from the publisher via Netgalley.
The Dublin Murder Squad series is one that I am thoroughly enjoying, even though I am reading them out of sequence. That doesn’t matter though – because each can be read as a standalone with a different protagonist in each one. Having said that, we once again join forces with Conway and Moran who we last met in The Secret Place, but this time everything is told from Antoinette Conway’s point of view. We follow the pair as they are assigned to investigate what should be an open and shut murder case – but is it?

I did find the story a little slow to grab my attention. It wasn’t until about the half way mark that it really picked up pace, but when it did – it really gripped me from that point on. If you are finding it a bit slow, stick with it, because it really does turn into a corker of a read. Ultimately, it is a solid detective read, with a complex well thought out plot line and enough original twists and turns to keep you guessing. After The Secret Place, it was nice to get inside Antoinette’s head and discover how her mind worked especially in relation to the problems she faced every day at work – the prejudice, sexism and bullying in the workplace. We got to know her in a way that we missed out on last time around and she comes across as much more human. I am guessing that if the author has plans for another Dublin Murder Squad book then we may not see Antoinette next time around, but personally I would love to see more of her!
"
"Tana French is simply the best. Though I didn't like this as much as I liked Broken Harbor (though really, will I ever like anything as much as Broken Harbor?), it's still an excellent addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series.

And if you're just starting French's books, you don't have to read them in order. Just grab the one that looks the most interesting to you. (Seriously, do it! She's great!)"
I am going to keep this one short and sweet. I adore this author so there isn’t any real reason to break out the whatever it is I usually bring to a review. I consider her and her books to be just like an old friend that occasionally invites you out for a random night of fun. You aren’t 100% sure of what it entails but you do know it’s a guaranteed good time. This book was no exception. It was right in line with what she has produced. I did decide to deduct a star because the whodunit was a bit predictable and I didn’t care for some of the characters. Still a great read though.
"French’s Dublin Murder Squad novels are always powerful, but there was something darker and more incisive about The Trespasser that made me thankful I’d taken a long, slow journey through the six in the series—spacing them out, taking time to devour them—since now there are no more left. A gaping void there. (At least not until she writes another, though there’s always The Witch Elm to tackle, which I doubt has the interwoven strands that hold the DMS series together.)  

What really gets driven home is how increasingly talented French has become with each in the series is her dialogue: she can write an 80-to-90-page chapter that’s solely interrogation, and keep you riveted; she knows how to write speech, point, and counterpoint, and she really gets the psychology of people’s gestures, movements, behaviors—she gets that detectives have interior lives as much as the victims and suspects do, and she weaves these together in sometimes profound ways.

All of which is to say: if you’re a fan of murder mysteries, French is the current reigning queen of them, if you didn’t already know that. And if you’re not a fan of murder mysteries, and are one of those who dismiss them solely as drivel or genre pieces: you don’t know what you’re missing by not taking a chance on someone as massively gifted as French is. Period.

4.5 stars"
"4 1/2 stars

I've read all six of The Dublin Murder series books and have liked them to varying degrees. But I love the approach French takes to crafting her story, to her writing and to how she builds on the previous books - these things keep me coming back to see what French has in store for us with each new book. Also I am fascinated at how there is such a divergence among her readers of which are their favorites! There are also a few things that bug me about her books; primarily I have described them as bloated. In each book there are passages that just go on and on long after the points have been made and the tension has been built.

I think this might be my favorite of the six. Indeed, for the first 2/3 of the book I thought I would give it 5 stars, which I have not done for any of the previous novels. I liked how she plucked Antoinette Conway, a supporting character from The Secret Place to be the main D and narrator of this book. She has been recently promoted to Murder and has not had an easy time of it from the established D's leading her to feel persecuted and paranoid. She is paired up with another newbie, Steven Moran - do I remember correctly that he was a floater in Broken Harbor? Neither has been given a case to lead, but at the end of an overnight shift they are given a seemingly easy case of domestic murder. Tough as nails, she sets out to prove to everyone, including Moran, that she has what it takes to lead a case in Murder. That they are tired and distrusting adds to the atmosphere of the book. Another thing I liked is that French sets The Trespasser mainly in Murder Squad HQ, something she's never done before. We get much more of a first hand glimpse at the squad dynamics and what might lead her to be both paranoid and to doubt herself. Previous books have all been set in the location of the murder and the abodes of the D's with mainly allusions to what's going on in the squad. I really liked this new dimension.

But I had to take off a half a star because of the same thing that has annoyed me in the past. On and on and on!! When Antoinette tells us her back story, when they interview a key witness and when they interview a suspect just to name a few. And Antoinette's paranoid ramblings get old after a while, even if we do understand their source.

But then all is forgiven with the brilliant ending! I often complain of rushed endings that feel like the author just needed to finish the book. The opposite is true here. The ""solve"" is fully developed and not necessarily what you might expect but also not ""out of nowhere"". And what happens after the solve is also fully developed, leading this reader to be highly satisfied by this new entry into the French cannon.

This is a great article about French from a recent New Yorker magazine. It is insightful and helped me appreciate her even more. http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201..."
"How bittersweet to reach the end of the line for the Dublin Murder Squad series tangle.

This is not a balanced review. More of a reflection of the series and me waxing rhapsodic on French.

To me, Tana French is in the highest tier of mystery authors. The stories, characters, scenes, and sense of pulse-pounding urgency are so unlike many of the filler authors I find elsewhere. There's a kind of magic in her storytelling. And it works so well for me.

I think anyone who reads mystery, literary fiction, dark academia, or lyrical prose should have French on their list. You just don't find them like this every day.

The Trespasser was a fitting end to the Dublin Murder Squad arc that started with In the Woods. We've come a long way since then, detectives have left us and changed over time, and the squad itself has soldiered on. But things can't stay the same forever...

Antoinette Conway was not the person I would have chosen as the last peek into our Murder Squad, but as an objective bystander I appreciated French's endgame. Conway is sharp, abrasive, and dealing with a chip on her shoulder so large it's a wonder she can walk. I understood her, mostly, because in the guy's guy world of the police force and the fraternity-level bro landscape of the Murder Squad, it's even worse for a woman to hold her own.

When it's Conway's turn to run the show, we get a really different view of our beloved squad. A more black and white, caustic view, but a view all the same. And there's a murder that needs to be solved.

Everything that plays so well in French's mysteries is on the board for this one: the snappy dialogue, the sense of a net slowly closing on its prey, the layers on layers of human experience shed one by one in the chase. The sense that nothing matters more than this, here, in this moment. (I always find myself lost to the plot for these reads, ignoring real life until they're complete)

But this one was bittersweet. And more so than the other ones, which is saying something as French already has a tendency for that tone.

Getting past Conway's absolutely demanding inner monologue took some patience and endurance. And the meat of this mystery was both exactly where I thought it was going (not a huge surprise, French's mysteries lie more in the whydunit category vs. the whodunit) and also, somehow, something else. A soft closing of the door versus the bombastic slam that I expected to fit with Conway's narrative.

I don't know. I loved it, obviously, but it's hard to love the end of something you love.

"Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series is simply rock-solid. 'The Trespasser' continues the string. I've read the series in order and am glad I did.... she does a wonderful job with character development and it's been a joy to experience how her approach deepens our understanding of the team members.

Antoinette Conway is the major player in The Trespasser, a detective with a chip the size of a boulder on her shoulder and few friends among her teammates. She picks up a murder assignment along with a fellow relative 'newbie' to the Murder Squad, and their boss sticks them with a 'star' super-experienced detective to lend a hand. The victim is a young woman found dead in her apartment, seemingly in the middle of preparations for a romantic dinner. The investigation reveals the fact that her father had abandoned his family years before and her 'date' was with a young man she'd met recently. Both become topics of inquiry as the investigation proceeds, with the various hypothetical scenarios discussed by the detectives causing much friction in the team. The 'star detective' wants to quickly close out the investigation when the victim's boyfriend’s story doesn't match facts, but Conway pushes on. Inevitably, the intra-team conflict escalates and the investigation fractures. The conclusion is a bit of a twist and I'm not entirely sold on how it played out, but it was a plausible explanation and result.

As with the others in the series, The Trespasser is tightly written with excellent dialogue and a good plot. I continue to be astounded at French's facility with translating spoken sequences onto the page. Since the main character is the narrator and so much discussion takes place between the detectives and suspects, it seems like a perfect match with the author's main strength. The Trespasser is an excellent addition to a great series of procedurals."
"Ten years ago, a debut crime novel was published. When I picked it up in the library I was intrigued, and so I brought it home. When I began to read I was captivated by the story, impressed by the quality of the writing, and just how much there was to the book.

It was contemporary police procedural, with a wonderfully real Irish setting; it was a compelling character study, written with real insight and understanding; it was a perceptive state of the nation novel …

That book was ‘Into The Woods’ by Tana French.

It wasn’t perfect by any means, but it was so very, very promising.

I had to buy a copy to keep, and I have loved watching the author do that same thing in so many different ways in the books that followed.

There have been six books to date; linked, but not quite in the way series are usually linked. Each book is centered around a member of the Dublin Murder Squad, who has usually appeared in an earlier book before becoming the protagonist of their own story. A story that will usually draw out their own story as well as the part they have to play in the investigation of a crime.

It was as if the author was walking among them, with a perfect understanding who to draw forward and who steer towards the shadows.

This time she makes the simplest of switches and it is wonderfully effective.

This time she makes the simplest of switches and it is wonderfully effective.

The two detectives at the centre of this story are the two who were at the centre of the last story. Then, Steve Moran, who was angling for a place on the murder squad, and Antoinette Conway, who already had her place there, had met and were working together for the first time; now nearly a year has passed and they are professional partners.

Then he was at the centre of the story; now she is. That may sound like a small change – and maybe it was- but it allowed me a much greater understanding of each of them. Antoinette Conway had seemed so cynical, and now I began to understand why. Steve Moran got on with people, he had an easy charm; but I began to think that maybe he sometimes used that, calculating the effect it might have. A different kind of cynicism.

They were left on the fringes of the squad, dealing with the dull routine work. Because Conway had never been accepted, and because Moran had been partnered with her.

The case that fell to them at the end of a shift seemed routine, but they were both pleased to have a case of their own to work.

Aislinn Murray, an attractive young woman, was found dead in her own home on a Saturday night. Her table had been set for a romantic dinner for two, but that dinner would never leave the kitchen. She had been struck in the face and she had fallen and hit her head on the fireplace. There was no sign of forced entry, no sign that she had been taken by surprise. And so it seemed that her dinner guest had killed her – maybe deliberately, maybe accidentally – and fled the scene. All they had to do was find him.

Detective Bresslin, who had been assigned to oversee their work, wanted them to do just that and close the case as quickly as possible, so that they could all get on with other things.

When Conway and Moran they meet Aislinn’s friend Lucy they realise that the case may not be as simple as that, and that there would be much more to Aislinn’s story than anyone had realised. Conway was sure that she had met her before ….

The story follows every detail of what happens, and I was fascinated. I had ideas, but those ideas and my feelings about different characters shifted as new facts came to light. I really wasn’t sure where this was going to go, how the story was going to play out until the very end.

This is a big book for the story it holds, and I can understand why some people wouldn’t like it, but there are many reasons what I did.

Antoinette Conway’s narrative voice is perfectly realised, and she became a very real, very complex woman. She could be infuriating and I couldn’t always agree with the things she said and did; but I understood that she had her reasons and I understood what made her the person she was.

She carried me through the story.

This case changed her, and changed things for her, as is often the way with Tana French’s lead characters.

Every character who passed through this story was well drawn. The dialogue, the settings, the atmosphere – every element in this book worked, and that allowed the story to live and breathe.

I loved the way that themes were repeated through the stories of the detective and the victim. Each of those stories held some improbabilities, but they were credible and they said much about the issue and the choices that young women can face in the world today.

I’m avoiding details, because I don’t want to spoil the story, and because it is so much a whole that it is difficult to pull things out and have them make sense on their own.

The book works so well, as a police procedural and as a human drama; and it says what it has to say about the world very well indeed.

I hope I won’t have to wait too long for the next one.

4.5 Stars
"My reaction to The Trespasser is all over the place. I admired vast swaths of this police procedural but I was very glad when it was over. Tana French is like John Coltrane for me. I’m forever blown away by the innovation and craftsmanship and some albums bring me to my knees. But a few others, I’m the one looking around the room thinking, Whaaaaa??

I'm fully in awe of French's singular talent. Some of her novels come together in a way that I could read them over and over (The Searcher, Fuck Yeah I LOVE THIS BOOK, Faithful Place), others I could throw at a wall (The Witch Elm) and many that fall in that in between place of exasperation and intrigue. So it is with The Trespasser. The endless conversations and Detective Antoinette's Conway's prickly self-consciousness felt labored. Yet the whodunit snapped and crackled.

An attempt was made to parallel the reader's emotions about Antoinette and Aislinn Murray, the murder victim, both of whom carried scars of missing or absent fathers. It didn't take long for me to wish Conway would stop with the navel-gazing and get some sleep. I wasn't convinced by Aislinn's obsession to find her father, which transformed her from a passive wallflower into a blonde bombshell ready to boil some rabbits (yes, there were frequent references to Fatal Attraction). Detective Frank Breslin's preening game-show-host persona was so over-the-top that he became a caricature and his attempts to thwart the investigation felt forced by the author to lead to the inevitable conclusion. But behind the scenes in the Murder Squad was fascinating—I loved the curtain yanked back to reveal police culture and the unglamorous grind of an investigation. All the threads pulling together in the end was deeply satisfying.

Intelligent, evocative, atmospheric, wearying and often exasperating, The Trespasser is still better than most of crime fiction's best."
"4.5 stars. I just love Tana French. She manages to make crime thrillers into character-led dramas. Her stories suck you in, she uses humor very well, she knows how to set a scene and I gobble up the little details like candy.

A woman is killed with apparently one punch to the jaw in this one, and left for dead. Interestingly, I liked the prime suspect right away. Which is not typical for me.

If you’re used to Harlan Coben type thrillers, her books may start a little slow for you, but if you’re in the mood for a book that has a fair bit of character detail up front, and you’re not in a rush, but you want a good story to lose yourself in, imo you can’t go wrong with her books. This became a full-on thriller at roughly the 60 or so percent mark, for me. I never want her books to end.

The audios are also all well done, so print or audio, two thumbs up!"

"Tana French knows how discomfitting uncertainty can be. She exploits that feeling to drive the suspense in this unusual criminal procedural. To begin with, there is the first person viewpoint of the narrator, Antoinette Conway. She and her partner Steve Moran have been saddled with a veteran detective to oversee their work on what appears to be a routine domestic. A young woman is dead of a skull fracture, most probably inflicted during a lover's quarrel. Like her alpha colleagues, Conway is territorial. Oversight or interference? Either way, the move has planted a seed of paranoia into fertile terrain. Malicious pranks have plagued Conway's brief tenure in the Dublin Murder Squad, and she has fought back with an abrasive attitude, lest anyone believe she could be cowed into submission. Thus, French pulls the reader into the possibly unreliable narrative of a volatile character and dangles the possibility of conspiracy. That tension builds as Conway even starts to distrust her partner, the only person in the squad she can get along with.

Conway and Moran find only circumstantial evidence to support the lover's quarrel scenario. Rory Fallon, who had recently started dating the victim, and who had been invited to dinner the evening the victim was murdered, is the obvious person of interest. Yet, there are other possibilities. The victim's best friend seems to hint at a second boyfriend. When the detectives press her for details, she tries to distance herself from the friendship. At the same time, she insists Rory and the victim Aislinn were soul mates and that Rory would never harm Aislinn. Rory insists that when he arrived at Aislinn's home, there was no answer so he left, figuring he had been stood up. Yet, he seems nervous when accounting for his time line that evening. Again, there is that uncertainty. What parts of which stories are to be believed?

French immerses the reader in the mindset of her detectives. “When you badger a statement out of some traumatized witness, or manipulate a mother into giving evidence that'll put her own kid in jail, you get to enjoy the buzz of winning without tying yourself in knots over the deeper moral subtleties, because you're the good guy in the story.” (p.114) It's a dangerous yet telling statement about a closed society of hyper-vigilant predators. They despise weakness and they sense it from Rory: “Breslin's grinning, a wet open grin like hunger. He's loving this. I feel it too. We're getting good at Rory, we know how to work him now; he's all ours. We can bounce him up and down, fling him into fancy shapes, like our very own little yo-yo.” (p.100) As the interview proceeds, Conway confides: “Rory is fun when he's pissed off: like a fluffy little attack gerbil.” (p.101)

Conway provides a fascinating collection of interview techniques. It's not just good cop/bad cop. She can be intimidating as Man-Hating Bitch or congenial Cool-Girl; “One guy on the squad does a beautiful line in Father Confessor, piling on the guilt and waving absolution like a doggy treat;” (p.82) These multiple roles have a dizzying fluidity, ramping up the witness' anxiety level, encouraging him to improvise on what was once a tidy, slick as glass narrative of innocence and ignorance.

French reinforces this sense of an insular society in her description of Dublin Castle where the squad is stationed. “Murder works out of the grounds of Dublin Castle, smack in the heart of town, but our building is tucked away a few corners from the fancy stuff the tourists come to see, and our walls are thick; even the early-morning traffic out of Dame Street only makes it through to us as a softer undemanding hum.” (p.3) It's a subtle passage from the Castle to the squad room to the interrogation room, a territory marked by the scent of stale coffee and fear-induced sweats, to the insides of her characters' heads.

It is a remarkable feat for Tana French to spend so much time walled up in these rooms, letting the characters unintentionally reveal themselves. Conway carries too much rage to be sympathetic, but French still makes the reader care about her. Where there is brittleness, she conjures fragility; where there is fierceness she conjures vulnerability. In this book, French abandons the lyrical prose she is so adept at (and which I loved in her earlier books) for the darker depths of the human psyche. I'm not certain I found these characters totally plausible, but I wanted them to be, and that's what kept me glued to this book.

NOTES:
An essay on the direction of French's writing to date. https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20..."
"Antoinette Conway has a chip on her shoulder roughly the size of Dublin Castle, where Tana French's fictional Dublin Murder Squad is headquartered. Although I liked her as a secondary character in The Secret Place, the bitch who gets shit done, she took a while to warm up to as a narrator. She's had a tough time as the only female detective in Murder, but it's difficult to determine how much is her paranoia and how much is real.

Antoinette and her partner, Steven Moran, are finishing up a night shift filled with dirtbags who curb stomp other dirtbags when they're handed a case that just came in. A beautiful young woman was found dead amidst preparations for a dinner date in her own home. The logical suspect is her intended date, a spineless book shop owner, but with pressure for a quick solve being applied from multiple directions, something is off. Antoinette & Steve struggle to find the truth, not knowing who they can actually trust.

Being inside Antoinette's head is uncomfortable, which is fairly standard for this series. French writes complicated narrators who struggle with their own internal demons along with the criminals they investigate. But Antoinette's position, seeing herself as destined to be bullied out of the job she's worked so hard to earn, was just painful. 
There were so many bad ways I could see this ending. Happily, Tana French delivered the closure I needed for the case and for Antoinette. It's a reflection of French's skills as an author that I didn't take for granted that would come. Some of her narrators have ended up wrecked.

After seeing this one through, it's one of my favorites of the series, probably tied for 2nd/3rd with The Likeness, after my all-time favorite Faithful Place. (No one has my heart like Frank.)"
This is the final book in the Dublin Murder Squad series and I thought it was the best. A straight forward murder investigation of a woman found dead in her home is complicated by internal office politics on the squad. 
"A book that shined with bringing to the surface the world of criminal investigation, the organization and lives of detectives. This is Tanya French back in her groove matching insights and cognitive tumblings in joining the worlds of, crime, mystery, suspense, with the literary novel, while well balanced in the arms of psychology and array of perceptions and insights.

Along with this amalgam of gifts TF is a prolific and precise plotter planting the smallest of seeds only to have them break the soil’s surface sending up shoots, which later blossom into turning points and taking its place in moving the overall composition forward.

ALMOST

This most readable work lost 1 star. A painful trip to the executioners axe. At a point in the book the detectives kept piling on theories regarding the crime, finally at such a rate that I began to gag and suffocate. This led even to a couple of them being so preposterous that it short-circuited the book’s flow for me. I needed more to keep going. And more I got.

Generally, if I read more than twenty pages in a day I have EMTs pumping my chest. With The Tresspaser I read one hundred pages in a day and still not in a hospital read another one hundred the next day. And get this; I remembered most of what I read. This was because of the imagery, the astuteness of the understanding of body language, of the mechanisms of Psychology, the well titrated building of suspense, and how the first person narrator, Conway the lead detective, was willing to take me along on her quests leaving me somewhere between participant and observer. Fortunately she did not forget to give me enough vengeance to keep my blood thirst flowing. Could not wait till so and so got their comeuppance.

Through all the different angles, possibilities, the trenchant reasoning to apparently seal each theory airtight, TF created what was for me the perfect ending for this book and as it turns out for the series.

If you haven’t read The Dublin Murder Series I really encourage you to since for me it was truly a great and interesting reading experience."
"Ever since her iconic In The Woods leapt straight onto my favourite books list, French has been a must-read author for me. She brings the craft, sophistication and maturity of 'literary' fiction to the crime novel and uses the genre to explore modern Ireland as well as the complexities of the individual psyche under extreme pressure. Her hook in this series is to take a subsidiary character from one book and place them centre-stage in the next so that we're in both familiar and decentred territory each time, and that sense of alienation is one of the qualities that makes French's fiction so edgy and a little subversive.

Here a 'traditional' murder of a young woman is the starting point but alongside the police investigation is a meditation on narrative and storytelling, the ways in which we make sense of the chaotic world both negatively and positively, both rightly and incorrectly - and one of the pulls through the book is the unravelling and exposure of 'wrong' stories. This can certainly be read as a standalone but gains resonance against the previous books in what is only loosely a series.

With gorgeous writing, absolutely real characters and a controlled sense of pace and plot, French's books are ones which I both want to race through to find out what happens, and also linger over because they're just so good. This isn't quite as brilliant as French's superlative In The Woods, Broken Harbour and The Secret place, but still in the (over)-crowded crime space French is the real deal."
I love this whole series. If you are looking to see if I liked this as much as the other Dublin Murder Squad books then the answer is YES. 
"3.5 stars

This explores the stories we all tell ourselves, the power some of us have to make fantasy into reality, and the very serious consequences that can result.
There's a lot of making-shit-up-out-of-nothing-at-all going on and I felt it became tiresome by mid-point. I understood the vehicle, I just didn't like riding in it for so very long and I never felt involved.
I also wasn't sold on Moran and then Conway creating and then fully believing elaborate scenarios that had very little support. And Aislinn's shenanigans? Talk about a long con, especially for the reader.

Also, I am not comfortable with the possible insinuation that some non-white women may not be as self-aware as they think and all those microaggressions they experience are really just in their heads or, at least, it's not nearly as bad as they think. If they would just get over themselves...
Conway was expecting racism and sexism so she got racism and sexism because when you go looking for something, you'll find it. It's her own fault a co-worker peed in her locker and if she'd just have looked beyond her limited scope, these things probably wouldn't have happened. Also, she should smile more.

Overlapping stories in this one: skewed realities and mountains from molehills, daddies and daughters, lurkers in dark coats and hats, REVENGE!"
"Irish novelist and theatrical actress Tana French’s new novel THE TRESPASSER (Dublin Murder Squad #6) returns with the two previous young detectives from the Dublin Murder Squad, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, who solved the prep-school slaying in The Secret Place (2014).

Having read The Secret Place Moran and Conway, is an interesting and dynamic team—where Moran longed for wealth and Conway was resentful of it, as they go back and forth with their sarcastic banter while developing a bond, and solving a murder.

In THE TRESPASSER they pick up after knowing one another for a while and partnering for four months, while still testing one another.

Presently, Conway and Moran are assigned to investigate the murder of a 26-year old Aislinn Murray, a young woman found dead in her Dublin home. Her boyfriend is the initial suspect, which leaves the two less than thrilled to have the case because it looks like a routine domestic killing without a lot of work or effort. Something is not right.

A good-looking young woman blonde and beautiful (Barbie-like), Aislinn Murray is found dead in her beautiful meticulous home from a punch to the face and a smack on the fireplace hearth. The table is set for two, for a special dinner. The dinner cooking.

She appeared to have a date with a bookstore owner named Rory Fallon, and she evidently died from a blow to the head.

She and her partner begin to look at other suspects; however, they are getting pressure to make an arrest and the boyfriend is the most likely choice. However, there could be something here still is not adding up. Could it be something right in front of them?

Are they the stooges, set up to close a case, without any real investigation?

With some politics, corruption, lies, and personal dynamics, we turn to Conway, the only woman on the Murder Squad. She suffers from sexist, abusive, and continuous harassment. Bad jokes. This has been going on so long, and it is wearing her down to the point considering quitting. However, she loves her job. She does not want a simple domestic case, she wants serial killers.

Not only is she the only woman on the squad; she also is mixed race. A constant struggle. She comes across as very defensive, paranoid, at times; coming unglued from her tough exterior. She is determined to solve this case.

As Conway and Moran get closer to the truth, seems something is getting in their way. Secrets will be exposed. Someone in the department seems to be steering the Murray investigation in a particular direction. But why the setup? Is the entire squad a conspiracy?

Antoinette is bothered by the murder, during the investigation as she views her own history. Both women were abandoned by their fathers. Was there more behind her beauty?

As always, French delivers an absorbing well-written read crime/literary suspense thriller. However, when comparing to The Secret, not quite as intense. Still, there is a nice balance of literary and crime, where we see the beauty of her writing with some strong interrogations scenes.

I liked this observation of French's work The New Yorker

“In her books, the search for the killer becomes entangled with a search for self. In most crime fiction, the central mystery is: Who is the murderer? In French’s novels, it’s: Who is the detective?”

If you are a fan you will most likely agree, this is what truly separates French from other crime writers. In this installment, this was especially the case. The novel shifts to Conway.

As recently mentioned in the The Washington Post

“French’s books have achieved this success because they’re unfailingly intelligent and beautifully written and because they are never lurid — there’s little sex or gratuitous gore in them.

Their magic lies less in the crimes themselves than in the distinct new worlds French creates to showcase each of them. Readers understand and embrace her work; it’s time for more of the people who review books and award prizes to rethink the cliches about genres and recognize the excellence — the literary excellence — of her work.”

""I’ve never been much for the artificial divide between ‘literary’ fiction and ‘genre’ fiction,” she said in a recent interview. “I’ve never seen why audiences should be expected to be satisfied with either gripping plots or good writing. Why shouldn’t they be offered both at once?”

I listened to the audiobook, performed by Hilda Fay and was not overly fond of the narrator. Would recommend reading in book format. Would love for the author to narrate her own books, further enhancing the overall ""French"" experience.

"This is truly a fantastic book. Wonderful nuanced characterization of a salty, cynical, flawed, smart woman detective Antoinette (I just loved her voice) combined with a fascinating, expertly plotted and paced crime story. I loved how preoccupied the narrative was with stories: the stories we tell ourselves about our lives and the stories detectives construct when investigating. Excellent voice acting in the audiobook."
"The sixth book in French's Dublin Murder Squad series follows Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway, the lead characters of The Secret Place. It's a bit of a departure for French to follow the same characters two books in a row, but this time around, Antoinette is the point-of-view character. We still don't know much about Stephen or Antoinette—not like we knew Frank and Cassie and Scorcher and even fuckin' Rob—but the shit she has to deal with as a woman of color is instantly recognizable and immediately put me on her side.

If French's previous books were a teenage ghost story, a psychological thriller, something nasty in the woods, family dysfunction, and deep undercover in a Donna Tartt The Secret History fanfic, then this is Law & Order: Extreme Procedural Unit. It's a very detailed look at how a murder investigation is run, right down to the floaters assigned to the case and each of their jobs. Steve and Antoinette (and I feel like she should have a nickname because that is a lot of name but we don't even know her well enough to know what her friends call her) spend most of their time in the office, searching through paperwork and sending floaters out to track down leads. It's not very exciting, but it is interesting in its own way, and French's writing is so easy to read that, I mean, you'll definitely notice that the first half of the book is spent like this, but you might not care very much.

It doesn't have the same feel of French's earlier books where the detectives are inextricably linked to the crimes they're investigating, and that's okay, that kind of approach makes me uncomfortable for a number of reasons, but mostly because that's not responsible police work. I don't need the investigators to be personally tied to the crime, but the last two books, French hasn't seen fit to develop her detectives beyond the case at hand. Antoinette's background does mirror that of the victim's, and while it informs Antoinette's reaction to the case, it's not overwhelming, and it doesn't send her into a downward spiral of terrible decisions; so that's new for French, too. Stephen's still kind of a mystery, despite being in three of these books now. I like the way Antoinette thinks of him, and looks at him, though. In this book, I learned Stephen has red hair! I feel like I didn't know that! He just doesn't feel like a red-head to me, but then I couldn't tell you what he feels like. A brunette, if you'd asked.

I liked Steve and Antoinette's partnership—which, when will I learn?—and I sympathized with Antoinette's problems, even though she's a tough character. She doesn't give you a lot to work with because she's so busy guarding herself against incursions. She's suspicious, and has every right to be, but it also means she's closed off from most human contact. She says she likes it that way, but we're pretty sure she's lying.

I liked the book. I like the way the case was handled, and while it's full-on Tana French, I even liked the ending and its sense of exhausted hope.

Contains brief mention of animal harm, a single use of the word retard, and of course, murder."
"This is another installment in Tana French's series, ""The Dublin Murder Squad."" What I have found and I what I like most about this series is that each book is set in Dublin but the murder squads are always different with a new set of squad members each time. Rather than having the same group of characters in every book, you have someone new. The down side to this is that I have found a few, the second book in the series for example, whose characters I simply did not connect with. The upside is that I merely had to move to the next book.

The Trespasser is a good read with great character development, sharp wit and dark humor for which French is known. If you don't want to read the entire series obviously you can read this as a stand alone. I highly recommend this one. It is, by far, one of her best."
"Excellent police procedural from French about a young woman's death and the effect it has on multiple members of the Murder Squad, for different reasons. The writing is sharp, the characters are full of life and the story moves along nicely with a satisfying resolution that affects many and forces characters to rethink what they thought they knew about themselves. A big improvement over the last one in the series I read, A Faithful Place. Looking forward to the next one. Highly recommended."

Happy Reading, friends!

My first Tana novel & it did not disappoint.
"
"In the sixth installment of the Dublin Murder Squad, we stick with Detectives Conway and Moran, the detectives of the fifth book. This time we get Conway's POV. Let me just say that I appreciated sticking with this pair, the newest members of the Murder Squad, and by far the most vulnerable.

Antoinette is female, and she's a person of color. She doesn't fit in with the all white, all male detective crew, especially once she demonstrates how unwilling she is to play along with their gendered teasing. Teasing turns into hazing, and Antoinette's dealing with soiled lockers and missing paperwork on a daily basis. She trusts no one except Moran, the detective she recruited from a dead end position.

So it's unusual when a murder is called in, and another detective is assigned to work with the pair. Breslin's one of the good ole boys, and he seems to determined not to let Conway and Moran do a thorough investigation. The murder victim, a young woman, seems like a cut and dry victim of domestic abuse. So why does Breslin want them to stop digging?

I have the highest respect for this series. The Murder detectives are brooding, complicated messes, every one of them. Conway and Moran are no exception, but what's memorable is their partnership, matured since the early days of ""The Secret Place."" I would be delighted if the series stuck with them for just one more book (please!)."
"I always read Tana French's novels too fast because I'm devouring the plotline, then wish I'd slowed down and appreciated the scenery a bit more. They'd make good re-reads, if they weren't so hard to get your hands on from the library. With this novel, about 150 pages out of the middle evaporated on me yesterday afternoon. I read them so fast I totally lost track, like when you look down and realize you've absentmindedly eaten half a tray of cookies. I've now also caught up with everything French has written, so she's officially on the list of authors whose books I try to get the instant they come out.

French's work conquers the divide between the monotonous and the lovably familiar. Her writing style and the rotation of narrators save the books from ever feeling formulaic, but they are a bit formulaic. We always have a secondary character from a previous installment who has an unusual personal connection to the crime. In this case, Detective Conway has two smaller connections--one thematic and one practical--so that's a little different. I liked how she starts re-examining her career and peers on the Murder Squad at the end of the book.

My appreciation of the setting is also better than before--I was in Dublin this summer and can now picture the settings (like Dublin Castle specifically or neighborhoods and pubs, in a general way) much better than before."
Another great Tana French detective story that delves into the human psyche along the journey to solving the crime. I did this a re-read by audio as I had originally read it by Kindle when it first came out. The audio does add another layer to the story although as wasn't as impressed with the narrators as much as in some of her other books.
"3.5 Stars

To be honest, this was probably my least favourite out of all six Dublin Murder Squad books, mostly because angry, paranoid Conway did begin to annoy me quite a bit in the middle there (like, girl, calm down). But outside of this, it was a good mystery and an enjoyable read."
"Again I give 4 stars to a book out of the Dublin Murder Series and again I feel it's not enough.
Tana French is a master in dialogues, detective slang, tension building, psycological insight and slowly, not too slowly unravelling the truth. It's pretty flawless...

4,5! (I adored the audio book)"
"Another corker from the best in the biz -- I'm sorry it took me so long to get around to it.

More straightforward and less eerie than just about any other book in the series; in fact, there's something of an oversteer away from it after the straight-up fantastical riff in THE SECRET PLACE. For me, French is at her best when there's just a hint of the strange (THE LIKENESS remains my favorite for that reason) but that doesn't mean she isn't still hands and heads above everybody else the rest of the time. Antoinette is a complicated character to deal with and nobody in this book comes off looking so great, but the wrap-up is killer and it leaves me wondering (esp. on the heels of the announcement of her next, a standalone) if perhaps the Murder Squad is done. At least for the time being."
"Yep Tana French is a good writer. I've read all her books now, some as ARCs some I bought including this one. I certainly thought this one was better than the previous one - The Secret Place - for me. I only have a couple of reservations generally. I think there is a lot of dialogue which slows the story down and takes something off the pace too. The other aspect is the Irishness of it. She has been very successful with her books and rightly so. However the characters are sometimes almost caricatures of people for me and overly stereotypical. Good read though. "
"Este foi daqueles livros que me cativou logo pela capa. Tem um gato, por isso fiquei logo curiosa. Depois li a sinopse e ainda mais curiosa fiquei.
O livro inicia-se com um caso que, aparentemente, é mais um de violência doméstica e os detectives Conway e Moran ficam encarregues do caso, e contam também com o apoio do detective Breslin. Mas para os dois detectives, a resolução não é assim tão simples e acreditam que há algo mais.
Apesar de estar muito empolgada com o livro, não fiz uma leitura fácil. O ritmo é muito lento e ficamos com a sensação que a investigação policial não está a conseguir chegar a boas conclusões.
Em relação às personagens, não consegui criar nenhum laço ou empatia com a nossa protagonista, a detective Antoinette Conway, é daquelas pessoas desagradáveis, apesar dos bons resultados. E, verdade seja dita, começa a ser hábito em thrillers e policiais, a detective ter ""mau feitio"" mas esta Conway, irritou-me mesmo a sério.
Para mim, os melhores momentos foram as cenas dos interrogatórios, com alguma tensão e aqueles jogos policiais, agradaram-me bastante.
Senti que na parte final, a narrativa ganhou outro fôlego, onde nos vai ser finalmente desvendado os segredos e o verdadeiro culpado.
Apesar do ritmo lento e de não ter gostado de Conway, gostei muito da história e de ir formulando as minhas teorias, e o final foi muito bom. No entanto, acredito que não é um thriller para todos os leitores."
"The next Tana French publication always has me chomping at the bit, eager to read the latest goings on in the Dublin Murder Squad.

I was fortunate enough to get The Trespasser from the library shortly after it released. Honestly, in spite of some slow parts, I devoured it over a weekend. Rather than hash out a reiteration of other reviews and synopsis of the plot I’ll get to the pros and cons.

So, the previous book introduced Antoinette Conway and slid Stephen Moran back on to the scene. Moran was in Faithful Place as a minor character and had a bigger role in The Secret Place. I like him and hope to read more about him. Conway on the other hand was not a character I could warm up to. I just didn’t like her in the previous book so, to be honest, I was disappointed she held such a starring role in this book.  Admittedly I changed my mind about her by the end.

Midway through the book I thought it dragged a little. Too much talk and theorizing about gang connections (this will make sense when you read it) but then we turned a corner. The carrot is always dangling about who may have been the murderer and the guesses range from

1) The one they are focusing on is so obvious, it can’t be them,

2) If they are focusing on one person so much that it can’t be them, maybe that’s what the author wants you think and indeed…it is them,

3) You’ll be blindsided by a big revelation about 40 pages from the end and there is the ah-ha moment, the big reveal.

She has done that, a big twist, so you can’t rule anything out. By the end of the book I liked Conway better. She’s still not my favorite character but it won’t give me heartburn if she turns up in other books. The twist at the end was good. Well written with many theories and heated discussions between the detectives.

In the latter half of the book Detective Moran uses the phrase ""tickety-boo"" and I immediately remembered Joy writing about this on one of the British Isles Friday posts.  I'd never heard the term before and then it pops up in this novel.




Now I wait another 2 years for the next book in this series. That's about how long it seems to take for publication. Personally I am hoping Scorcher Kennedy makes another appearance but I don't think she will bring him back for more story lines. He wasn't everyone's favorite but I sure liked him.

Do you read the Dublin Murder Squad series and if so, what is your favorite book in the lineup?

"
"Another excellent Tana French novel. In fact, she's so consistently good in each book (and always in precisely the same ways) that it feels almost redundant to review each one separately (at least if you're avoiding spoilers). But here goes: The prose is literary, but never overwritten. The character of the narrator--in this case, Antoinette Conway who we first met in The Secret Place--is constructed carefully, with bits of history and turns of phrase and what she chooses to think about versus what she avoids thinking about, and each character-building brick is always impeccably thought through. The secondary characters, too--while you never actually get to see the world from their point of view--are just as layered and complex, so much so that it's easy to imagine entire rich lives for them that play out entirely separately from this story. The murder plot is engaging, but it's rarely the central focus, and that's never a problem. And while the exploration of what it means to be a woman in an Irish police environment is welcome, it's always done in a way that feels more like one character's (often flawed) perspective than it does like activism from the author. I do have the feeling that as with Rob Ryan, Antoinette Conway as a narrator might end up rubbing some loyal readers the wrong way--she's as prickly inside her head as she is when you're in the room with her--but I could only marvel at how carefully and subtly that prickliness was always realized.

My only complaints are minor. After the ridiculously long denouements of French's first few books (which I loved despite myself, but I still recognized them as too much), I felt like she finally figured out how to do a more economical ending in the last one, but this one was actually...almost too abrupt? A bit more specific character focus at the very end after the plot had been tied up would have been preferable to me, anyway. And while I think she did make it work, I never quite warmed to the first-person present-tense point of view. There were plot-related reasons why her default first-person past-tense narrative-with-hindsight wasn't going to fly here, but I'm honestly not convinced that first-person present-tense buys a writer anything that third-person present-tense doesn't, and a reader doesn't have to do the same kinds of mental contortions to make the latter read like a narration that could actually happen. But again, these were minor issues for me that never came anywhere near taking away from the intense pleasure of getting to climb inside of the mind of another one of Tana French's unique characters. She is not only the master of psychologically-driven crime fiction, but psychologically-driven fiction of any sort."
"I liked the protagonist even her paranoia and abrasiveness had a charm for me, the language was a bit of a challenge, many slang words that I had to look up or infer. The story has so many twists and turns to make your head spin, perhaps a bit too many?
I’ll definitely read more of this series. 3.5 stars

Fav Quote:

I don’t get rescued. I’ll take help, no problem, just like I took it off Gary and off Fleas. Rescue – where you’re sinking for the third time, you’ve tried everything you’ve got and none of it’s enough – rescue is different. If someone rescues you, they own you.
Not because you owe them – you can sort that, with enough good favours or bottles of booze dressed up in ribbons. They own you because you’re not the lead in your story any more.
You’re the poor struggling loser/helpless damsel/plucky sidekick who was saved from danger/dishonour/humiliation by the brilliant brave compassionate hero/heroine, and they get to decide which, because you’re not the one running this story, not any more.

"
"Tana French is a master; there's no question about that. But even a master can't hit a home run every time, and the fault in THE TRESPASSER lies with having to deal with Antoinette Conway for an entire book. With a bit more judicious editing, and with Conway toning it down just a tad, this book could have been brilliant; instead, it can be a bit of a slog -- so much so I thought I didn't actually really care to have my suspicions confirmed or not. Yes, it *is* worth it in the end; I just wish it wasn't so hard to get there."
"The sixth in the series, and the one I've liked best so far. Part of the reason was the audible recording was so good, but the writing was crisp and resolution of the crime, original. The characters were real and believable, and the Prime Suspect-like challenges of being a female detective rang true. Along with Denise Mina, French is one of my favorite crime novelists, however, as with Mina's Glasgow procedurals, French's Dublin novels tend to be a tad long with some bloating that could be cut, but I'll keep reading them nonetheless."
"well that’s it for my tana reread! anyway time to experience all 5 stages of grief

eta: oh my god i have read this book TWICE and it’s only JUST clicked that she’s antoinette conway as an allusion to antoinette cosway in wide sargasso sea. tana for FUCK’S sake-"
4.5 Love this series!
"Crime-solving aficionado I am not but occasionally, I do seek out a good story to huddle into. So, headlong I dive into contemporary Ireland with The Trespasser, the sixth and most recent offering of the Dublin Murder Squad (DMS) series by Tana French, a fast-rising author who has successfully straddled crime genre and literary work to critical acclaim *.

On hindsight, starting backwards from the last book was probably unwise. Each book in the series features a different detective, which is a brilliant concept that provides multiple points of view within Dublin’s elite murder squad over the course of the series. From a characterization perspective, this book may have suffered from my lack of foreknowledge even though each novel is designed to be standalone. It is not so much the individual personalities that I am missing as those are explored in each book, but the relationship vibes and the squad dynamics built into the series. In The Trespasser, Det. Antoinette Conway takes centerstage, with Det. Stephen Moran (protagonist in #5 The Secret Place) partnering up as her “chirpy little bollix”.

Conway is one angry woman. As the squad’s lone female, she is subject to offensive pranks and misogynistic harassment by fellow detectives that keep her perpetually in choleric mode. That, coupled with the stigma of illegitimacy to mixed race parentage in a lower class upbringing, provides loaded baggage to further exploit in future books. Conway’s sarcastic patois laced liberally with Irish slangs “shite”, “bollix”, “eejits”, “jaysus”, “gaff”, “grand”, “slag” and the likes, belies her private stream of insightful metaphors, a trademark of French in the other DMS books. Conway’s inner poetess makes me wonder at times who is channeling who - French through Conway, or vice-versa.

In The Trespasser, Conway’s ineluctable past rears its head in a loose parallel to the murder victim’s. One instance comes out of the left field presumably as a teaser for future Conway novels, otherwise the drama seems a tad redundant. The other instance is pivotal to solving the murder but was entirely too happenstance. My getting into groove, and reluctantly settling into the psyche of the characters only kicked in at the last third of story as each complicit person is revealed more deeply. Red herrings for motives are aplenty but for me, the psychological motivations seems contrived and emotionally unconvincing.

Certainly, French is an author to keep reading. The entertainment quotient is high, with the action primarily dialogue-driven and expressed in fine lines. Some readers may find the pacing sluggish particularly in the detailed interviews and police procedural, but I thought it appropriate to context. Though emotionally disengaged, my enjoyment is not diminished largely due to sound prose and a gripping plot replete with one tense interrogation after another.

If you are hankering to read a traditional detective-thriller, where the crime is the focus, this book will be a disappointment. Ultimately, the murder investigation of beautiful and complex Aislinn Murray, whose head was bashed in, is secondary and less interesting than the literary investigation of a far more complex heroine in Conway.


[* My next French book, In the Woods, DMS #1, won the Edgar award for best first novel in 2008]"
"Detective Antoinette Conway is on the murder squad, just like she always dreamed, but at times it is closer to a nightmare. The only woman on the squad, Conway is constantly subjected to harassment. But she keeps going, solving cases with her partner Stephen Moran, the newest addition to the squad and the only person who seems happy she's there.

Conway and Moran are assigned a new case. At first it appears to be pretty cut and dry - a lover's spat going horribly wrong and ending with a young woman getting her head bashed in. They bring in the boyfriend for questioning because of course, the boyfriend, but something doesn't seem right. Something is missing. Conway and Moran insist on following up on loose ends, which seems like a reasonable and thorough way to conduct a case and yet another detective - a veteran detective at that - keeps pushing them to close the case and just arrest the boyfriend. Something is definitely up.

Tana French has written six books now for her Dublin Murder Squad series and I've read every one. What I have loved about her books, especially the last two and this one is that I feel like I'm getting a comment on something true about life or society in addition to the mystery. With Broken Harbor it was the housing crisis; with The Secret Place it was girls' friendships and how the world tries to tell girls who they should be. With The Trespasser it's sexism and harassment and the way that kind of treatment can twist a person up. Conway has good reason to distrusts her fellow detectives. People try to screw with her in ways that are not only disgusting but that potentially damage her cases, which is scary because she is a murder detective after all. Screwing up her cases means violent criminals could go free. It twists her up. Conway doesn't know who to trusts so she trusts no one, which in turn makes it that much more impossible to make friends with anyone on her squad.

It took me a little while to get into this one. The first half focused on an obvious suspect but I knew it couldn't be that easy. I kept waiting for the real story to start. Once it did, I was all in. One of the interesting things about the Dublin Murder Squad series is that each books is told from the point of view of a different detective. The last book was Moran's point of view and of course here it was Conway's. I wouldn't mind getting more books that center on these two detectives. They're a good team."
4.5⭐
"We're up to the sixth installment in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series and she's still going strong. In this one, we hear from Antoinette Conway, the partner of Stephen Moran from French's previous novel, The Secret Place. Being a Detective on the Murder Squad isn't everything Antoinette hoped for. She isn't fitting in on the male squad--most of whom tease and prank her viciously--and she and Steve seem only to receive the most bland, boring cases. Not much bothers Antoinette, but she's about ready to leave the Squad behind for good. So when the latest case comes in--handed straight to Conway and Moran by their boss--it looks like much of the same: another domestic dispute. Beautiful, blond Aislinn Murray has been killed in her home. It looks like a typical lover's quarrel gone wrong. Aislinn's table is set for a romantic dinner, and she's dressed up for a beau. But as Antoinette and Steve investigate, they find things aren't exactly what they seem. Why is their colleague, Detective Breslin, so involved in their case? Why does Antoinette keep seeing someone following her home? And why is the local media out to get her? Antoinette knows the Squad doesn't like her, but now it seems like the hatred is wrapped up in her case, too. Who can she trust--and where will it end?

I'll say it up front: this was an excellent mystery. Just a wonderful read. I love all of French's novels, but thoroughly enjoyed this one. Antoinette was a refreshing voice and completely relatable. Her case was interesting and well-plotted, leaving you constantly guessing. As per a typical French novel, you don't receive just a simple mystery; each of her books comes with a backstory. In this one, we see Antoinette battling her demons and her inability to fit in with her Squad. Are they really out to get her, or is it all in her head? It's true that French's books probably aren't for everyone. There's a lot of talking, a lot of expounding, and a lot of knowing what her characters are thinking. But, in turn, you're presented with characters who are so complex, so rich and in-depth. It's amazing. I've said it in previous reviews, but I love that when I open one of French's novels, I know that I'll be completely transported into another world for a few days. Her writing is strong that you completely inhabit her characters and their environment.

Antoinette, as mentioned, is a complex female character -- strong yet vulnerable and just completely refreshing to find in a detective novel. Her relationship with Moran was very enjoyable to read about, especially after hearing about their initial early meeting in The Secret Place from Moran's point of view. There's a humor to Conway, lending levity when needed, but also a dark side. She's bitter with the world for a reason. Because the entire book is told from her perspective, we're figuring out the mystery with her, learning facts and alibis as she does, and unraveling the plot along with our detective. Of course, we're limited to seeing the case from her perspective, too. As Moran and Conway try to determine who they can trust, so do we. The book expertly leaves you guessing with the plot; it takes you in one direction early in an incredibly convincing matter. It also skillfully takes you inside the Squad, allowing us to see not only how a case is run, but the inner politics.

In this way, the novel is not just a well-crafted mystery but a lovely treatise on relationships and friendships and the lengths we go for both. I'm also left amazed at how much French can put into a novel. Her way with words is magical, and I just love her books, her stories, and her characters. I highly recommend this novel, or any of her earlier work. 4.5 stars."
"Fantastic book - I'm so excited to read the other ones in the Dublin Murder Squad series now.

I stayed up late several nights in bed this week reading this, unable to put it down - but not necessarily due to the actual crime depicted in the book itself. There is no physical action climax scene, where the suspect jumps out of a bush and attacks the protagonist...in fact, there's very little physical violence at all, barring the initial crime that sets off the course of action.

The suspense and thrills in this book are found purely in the machinations and strategy and Machiavellian interactions between the cops on the squad. The interrogation scenes are totally masterful. I loved that insight into the frictions and tensions of the Murder detectives, the carefully chosen words, the double play, the thinking two steps ahead...especially since I feel like so many cop thrillers push the ""buddy-buddy"" narrative. This book is all about process and procedure, and it's a fascinating peek-behind-the-curtains of law enforcement and the uncomfortable way it rubs up with the media, informants, victims and suspects. There are no white knights here.

The detectives on this squad are all suspicious and paranoid and mistrustful of each other (for reasons founded and unfounded), and it adds a complex layer to the book that is the true suspense. There are also partnerships between detectives (Conway and Moran, who I both loved, and Breslin and McCann - I have to admit to being thoroughly charmed at various times by bad-guy Breslin!) that are extremely close and fiercely loyal, so there are some really interesting dynamics to explore here.

Another thing I loved? The Dublin setting. You're just totally immersed in Ireland here - the slang, the dialogue, the city's own character, the sensibility of the novel and the characters and their actions. I love books that make you feel like you've got this insight into a culture/country/city totally unlike your own. The writing is so atmospheric and well-done. It's also laugh-out-loud hilarious at times - the observations and witty insights from the protagonist (detective Antoniette Conway) are very funny. The pacing is also pitch-perfect - it never feels too slow, but it's not too fast either. You have time to sink your teeth in on this one, and the whole reading experience is just so pleasurable. This is a book for people who love to read.

This book had such a unique voice, fantastic writing, and a smart, different take on the cop procedural that I'm all in on Tana French, and can't wait to see what else she's got out there."
"This is French's sixth thriller about the murder squad. I skipped the 5th one because I did not want to read or listen to teenage angst, so I did not have an introduction to the narrator of this thriller. Antoinette Conway has been on the murder squad for about two years and she is having a rough go of it as the book starts. And I must say, she was not likeable for the majority of the book. We were in her head for the whole book and she was paranoid. She suspected everyone of being out to get her or feeling sorry for her. I just wanted to give her a Gibbs smack. But despite the narrator being on the obnoxious side, the murder mystery was nicely done -- good plot, interesting (if not always likeable) characters. There's even a jab at Donald Trump. There were some nicely done twists and turns, all of which fit nicely into the plot (unlike with the Harlan Corbin thriller I read just before this one).

The murder person was a young, beautiful woman, killed while preparing dinner for her new beau, who of course was the primary suspect. And he could have done it - the circumstantial evidence against him was significant. But, Lucy, the victim's best friend (who denied being the best friend) said her friend had another ""friend."" The best friend said she did not know who the other friend was but he scared her. This info from Lucy and the fact that the killer turned off the cooker bothered Conway and her partner. They were also not happy because the head of the squad assigned a veteran detective to their team and he kept trying to take over the investigation.

All in all a good story that kept my interest.

"3,5 Sterne

Ich habe das wirklich hervorragend eingelesene englische Hörbuch gehört - die 20 Stunden sind nur so dahin geflogen.

Mein Verdacht war schon recht früh ""richtig"" , aber die Twists innerhalb der Story waren sehr gut gemacht.

(dennoch:es hatte auch wie fast immer bei French durchaus Längen...)

Aber was ich an dieser Reihe ja vor allem mag, ist die langsame, sehr psychologische Erzählweise. Als Leser steckt man tief drin im Kopf des Ermittlers, und ich fand die Stimme dieser misstrauischen, verletzten und vor allem sehr wütenden Frau ausgesprochen überzeugend.

Jetzt freue ich mich auf den nächsten Band und darauf,wer als Nächstes zum Erzähler wird..."
"Antoinette, the narrator and junior member of the Dublin Murder Squad, is a mess. She faces such harassment from her fellow detectives, she has a chip on her shoulder that would bring others to their knees. Mixed race, apparently abandoned by her father, a belligerent woman who assumes she'll need to fight for every case, every cup of coffee...every breath. Friends have described her as not very likable, and I'll second that. She is wounded...and doing the best she can. She doesn't trust people easily. But she's damned good at her job.

She and her partner, Stephen, catch a murder that everyone assumes is a 'domestic'. The only kind Antoinette seems to get. But she and Stephen, and especially she, won't go for the easy solve -- the wannabe boyfriend. She believes there's more.

And boy, is she right. Maybe more than she can handle. But, if this is going to be her last case in Murder, she's going to give Aislinn, the victim, as much justice as she can...not the easy or convenient answer.

There is a scene at the end, with Antoinette's boss, the Gaffer, who until that moment has been a caricature of an uninvolved, slightly sinister, gives her a master class on how to interrogate a suspect with respect and empathy.

I came to care for Antoinette as I understood why that chip is there, and why it's so big. She does learn to trust, to reach out. She has earned her place on the Squad."
"Another fantastic addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series, but it didn't quite reach the highs of In the Woods and Broken Harbour. As always, Tana French is a true master of dialogue and I was delighted that The Trespasser explored the murder squad dynamic, the individual roles, and personality clashes more deeply this time round. Conway was also a fantastic narrator, and I was much more invested in her and Moran as a partnership this time round than in The Secret Place. I'd already worked out the final culprit before the book's halfway point, and it did seem a bit strange that it took Conway and Moran so long to grasp what was happening, so personally I don't think the mystery was French's strongest for that reason. Still fantastic and highly recommended, as are all of the books in the series! How long do we have to wait for #7?!"
"4.5 stars
Another book in the Dublin murder squad series and just as good quality as all the others.
As discussed in previous reviews this series is not your typical detective series.
This one focuses on Detective Antoinette Conway who has frankly found settling into the murder squad almost impossible. Basically she won't take any crap and this has pitted her against 'likeable' members of the team who have consequently sullied her reputation and played pranks on her which she has tried to ignore because she is tough (?!...).
She's hanging on in there with her partner Stephen Moran (who has appeared in two previous books) and perhaps this case can earn them the respect they deserve.
But this is Tana French and it's never as simple as that!
Really enjoyed this and felt it deep in my bones - the story is long and painstaking as always but the pay off is a meaningful story rich in detail that takes everything you/they thought through the rapid wash cycle and dumps it out for sorting...several times.
Excellent read - it's only the length and some of the overly descriptive sections (not too many but sometimes the interviews make you feel like you're going to tear your hair out and confess to anything which is probably the point!) that prevent me giving this 5 stars.
"
"This 6th in the interconnected stories of the Dublin Murder Squad stars sole female detective, Antoinette Conway. She's prickly and brusque, even paranoid--but who wouldn't be after all the nasty tricks and bullying by the male members of the squad, who clearly aren't pleased to have her among them. When she and her partner pull a case that appears straightforward--young woman found murdered in her cottage--they sense something bigger is afoot, especially as a senior detective tries to steer their investigation. The pacing is relentless; characters are closely observed, especially Conway and the murder victim; the labyrinthine plot, obscured by perhaps too many theories and second guessing by Conway and partner, sets up a fine puzzle with a nice twist at the end; novels are all first person so they offer an intimate view of protagonists, and there is some perhaps surprisingly gorgeous prose in with the good interrogations; the tone is moody, atmospheric--does the sun ever shine in Dublin??; and readers--or listeners in Hilda Fay's fine narration--follow the step-by-step investigation and get a good sense of time and place. A good entry in an excellent series."
"Great psycological thriller with a spectacularly appealing crabapple of a heroine who doesn't take any shit(e). With a OneClickDigital deadline looming and no renewals allowed, the thing kept me up until 4 a.m."
"When it comes to melding murder and police investigations, exploration of character and the complexities of human interaction, Tana French is one of the best. Her latest book, The Trespasser is just as good as I expected. Is it as good as my favorites (In the Woods, The Likeness, and Broken Harbor)? No, but it’s still very good and since French’s books are much better than your average police procedural/thriller, that makes it exceptional.

The Trespasser reintroduces us to Murder Squad detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. They appeared in the previous book, The Secret Place. Conway is disliked by the rest of the detectives (her partner, Stephen Moran, being the exception) and is harassed on an almost daily basis. She blames this on the fact that she is the only woman on the squad and she is brown-skinned in a sea of white faces. Because of this, she holds herself apart from the rest of the detectives, assuming that if she responds to their jokes, she’d just be encouraging their sexism and racism. Moran is an amiable guy who hides his sharp mind under a goofy, “I’m just a newbie” wide-eyed kind of bumbling personality. They work the night shift, handling the unglamorous murders caused by domestics, drunks, and general scumbags. They both dream of the day when they can join the big boys and work on sexy, harder-to-solve, high profile murder cases.

One morning, when they are just ready to go off shift, their boss (the “gaffer” in Irish lingo) hands them a case of a woman who died in her living room. They suspect it’s just another domestic being pushed off onto them, but O’Kelly (their gaffer) wants them to work with Breslin, a senior detective. Conway will be lead detective and Breslin will supervise. Once Conway and Moran get to the victim’s house and start investigating, it becomes clear to them that the case may be much more complicated than a violent spat between lovers; it’s possible that members of their own squad may be involved. For much of the investigation, Conway and Moran are working to solve the crime before Breslin can and it becomes a very intense game between the three of them—everyone knows they are acting a part in a charade where they are supposedly all cooperating and sharing information, but they all have their own motives for keeping secrets. Conway, as the lead detective, is often blinded by her own assumptions and misconceptions about the victim and her fellow detectives.

Conway is a hardass with a chip on her shoulder. She has a persecution complex to a certain degree but as she is the narrator, you agree with her—until about the middle to three-quarters into the book when her paranoia gets completely crazy and you want to bitch slap her. She’s a difficult character to like, but that’s okay because French doesn’t care if you like her. You don’t need to in order to be completely sucked into this book and the lives of these people. Her partner, Steve Moran, balances her out; he’s easy-going where she’s difficult, he’s patient and thorough when she wants to charge ahead blindly. The two work well together and support each other—all without any hint of romance.

There is a lot of dialogue in this book—most of the book is Conway and Moran (and sometimes Breslin) interviewing suspects and friends of the victim. If you like police procedurals that include a lot of skulking down dark hallways and gun battles, this is not your book. The thrill of the book is knowing that there are several layers to the conversations—Conway and Moran and Breslin are NOT on the same page and are, much of the time, working against each other. They are all aware that they’re playing at a game and the suspense is: who’s going to be the best at it? I had the murder figured out fairly early in when 
Conway overhears Detective Breslin talking with his partner, McCann. That’s when I put together the hints that French has left out (both for the reader and for Conway) and decided that McCann had been having an affair with Aislinn Murray and killed her. Breslin was helping to steer the case towards the dead girl’s boyfriend, Rory. It has nothing to do with gangs or Breslin and McCann being “bent” detectives. French is such a talented writer that her characters can have one theory of the murder, and readers can have another. With her books, it’s not usually who did it that’s so fascinating. It’s the why and how detectives get to that conclusion.

One of the welcome changes in this book is French’s lyrical prose has been reigned in. She’s a beautiful writer with a feel for language, but in the last book I felt that her writing had taken extreme flights of fancy, so much so that I found myself distracted by her poetic musings. French is either a sensible author who can police her own tendencies for fanciful writing, or she has an excellent editor. Either way, this book is a return to her more solid story-telling skills. It’s still beautifully written, but it doesn’t sound so artfully forced. This is Conway thinking about the case meeting she’s about to hold on the investigation of the murder of Aislinn Murray:
I used to love the first case meeting, love everything about it. The pulse of the incident room, everyone taut as greyhounds at the traps; in that room every answer comes in closer on top of the question, every glance snaps round faster. The whip crack of the jobs being assigned, Murphy collect the CCTV footage, Vincent check gold Toyota Camrys, O’Leary talk to the girlfriend, bam bam bam. The moment when I’d shut my notebook and say Go, and we’d be all out of our seats and halfway to the door before my mouth closed on the word. I used to come out of that meeting feeling like the bastard we were after didn’t have a chance in hell. By this time, even the thought of it—floaters eyeing me up and down, wondering which of the rumors are true; me eyeing them back, wondering which of them is going to glom onto any slipup, blow it up huge and barter it for a laugh and a pat on the back—turns me hangover-queasy and hangover-mean (127).

The Trespasser is an excellent page-turner of a murder mystery. French’s talent is not just in composing an engrossing whodunnit, but in exploring the interior lives of her detectives. Their weaknesses and egos and desires are exposed in the course of these investigations and sometimes this makes them better detectives and stronger people, but sometimes it doesn’t. In a Tana French novel, no one emerges from investigations unscathed. I enjoy French’s explorations of her characters’ souls—which she accomplishes without moralizing (take notice, Louise Penny). If you’re new to Tana French, you do not have to read the books in any particular order. While the books center on Dublin’s Murder Squad detectives, you can pick up any book and read it. I encourage you to do so.

"Move over John Sandford; Tana French is a tough competitor for ""best police procedural crime novelist."" This is the first book I have read in French's Dublin Murder Squad series and I will definitely be back for more of the same. The American-Irish writer tells an intense tale from the viewpoint of Dublin Murder Squad Detective Antoinette Conway, a brash, smart but vulnerable newbie and the solo woman in a macho squad room of men, whose vicious pranks and harassment have nearly put her over the edge. She and her newbie partner Steve Moran are handed the case of a young single woman found dead in her cottage home. Their suspicions are alerted when an experienced, smooth talking detective Steve Breslin is assigned to ""watch over"" their investigation so they don't make any mistakes.
French's writing is engaging and intense, capturing the day-to-day tedious parts of police work as well as the adrenaline rush moments when leads pan out and witnesses confirm theories. She puts the reader right in the interview room as the detectives unravel the motives and mindset of their suspects, playing good cop/bad cop roles and using psychological techniques to get suspects to open up. I was totally captivated and could not put the book down with new twists occurring at lightning speed in the 450 page novel. Well done."
"I always like the way Tana French fleshes out her characters, prominently including all the emotional baggage that makes them who they are. And it's fun to meet new detectives in each new book to love and hate.

Detective Antoinette was especially aggravating. She's a young detective who worked her way up to the Dublin murder squad with a huge chip on her shoulder. As the only woman currently on the squad, she's sure everyone is against her and wants her to fail. As a reader, I was never sure how much of her perception of her peers is true, and how much is her persecution complex. She has no patience or tolerance for emotional weakness, which makes her pretty tough in the interrogation room.

One of the other main characters who was expertly depicted is the victim, Aislinn. Though she's dead right from the start, we learn so much about her during the investigation that she feels very real and her death particularly tragic.

I had to plod a bit though some parts. Especially a particularly long and mentally brutal interrogation which I felt could have been edited down a bit. But in the end, I was totally along for the ride and couldn't wait to see how it played out."
"Very enjoyable crime story from the Dublin Murder Squad series.

This book was full with very development, gritty characters. Tana French's main strength lies in her ability to write great characters, the kind that most ofter you want you want to slap and yell at. The MC in this story was infuriating but I still wanted her to get her to get her solve and move onto greater things.

I listened to the audio version, well narrated by Hilda Fay."
"У цикла ""Дублинский отдел убийств"" есть классная фишка - в каждой следующей книге повествование ведется от лица персонажа, который в предыдущей книге был второстепенным.

В ""Тени за спиной"" это Антуанетта Конвэй, наиболее необъективный из всех необъективных рассказчиков. Практически каждая деталь расследуемого ей дела окрашена ее личными оценками, опасениями и предположениями. У Конвэй довольно циничный взгляд на жизнь, и чуть ли не каждое проявление человечности в людях она воспринимает как проявление слабости. Первое время меня это жутко раздражало.

Однако по ходу повествования мы, как водится у Таны Френч, ближе знакомимся с рассказчицей, проникаем к ней в голову и начинаем ее отчасти понимать. Дело, которое Конвэй расследует со своим напарником Стивом Мораном, не выглядит особенно сложным. Молодая девушка была найдена мертвой в своем доме. Этим вечером она готовилась к романтическому ужину со своим новым парнем. Парень - самый вероятный кандидат в убийцы, казалось бы.

Но, конечно, все не так просто. Атмосфера в отделе оставляет желать лучшего. Конвэй считает, что остальные детективы хотят выжить ее, потому что она женщина. А тут еще шеф, как назло, навязал им с напарником ""третье колесо"" - старшего детектива по имени Бреслин. Бреслин хочет закрыть дело как можно раньше и давит на молодых коллег своим авторитетом, но Конвэй и Моран упрямо собирают улики и отказываются торопиться в ущерб качеству. А еще у них обоих - навязчивое ощущение, что расследование движется в никуда...

Как это часто бывает у Френч, наиболее простые на первый взгляд дела оказываются по факту чуть ли не самыми сложными. Меня так заинтересовал твист с конце, что я даже поинтересовалась у папы (он следователь на пенсии), как он бы поступил в такой ситуации. Папа не задумываясь ответил, что поступил бы точно так же, как Конвэй и Моран, и добавил, что такие случаи в его практике были не так редки, как хотелось бы."
"Opinião em:



https://youtu.be/ISv4MjMDHQ8"
"You can hear the Irish accent as you read along. The book is part crime, part mystery, part something just fun to read."
Book #10 - Trespasser by Tana French. This is the sixth book in her Murder Squad series. While it was good it seemed loooong. Some of that may have been become I didnt read the earlier books yet. I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. It'd be an 8 if it'd been shorter. (The long/short may have been because I listened to it on audio)
"This was really good, but somehow I forgot this author's commitment to utter misery."
"No one writes a story like Tana French. Her style is original, not like any I’ve read elsewhere. And her dialog: it’s so good I feel like I’m there—in Ireland—and she even has me feeling at home with all the Irish slang. She also doesn’t waste space or my time with paragraph upon paragraph describing the atmosphere in which her story takes place, as so many authors do.

So much for French’s books in general. As for THE TRESPASSER in particular, while it’s not as good as her BROKEN HARBOR, which blew me away, it’s up there with FAITHFUL PLACE, which is her second best. I’ve read all her books, so you can take my word for it.

All her books, so far, are about different characters, detectives mostly, on the Dublin Murder Squad, although each stands alone and doesn’t depend on the last book. In THE TRESPASSER, two of the characters, partners Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, have also appeared in other books, although here they are main characters.

Conway is the narrator. Throughout the book we see what Conway sees and read how Conway feels about it. She is having a hard time as the only female on the squad. But the careful reader will sometimes suspect her perception.

She and Moran are tired of always getting the domestic murder cases handed to them. When they are given a case involving the murder in her home of a single young woman, they are sure it’s another cut-and-dry Domestic, easy to solve, even too easy. But this turns out to be more. This may even have the rest of the Murder Squad hating them.

Conway and Moran also have to deal with Detective Don Breslin, who seems to be trying to steer their case toward the victim’s new boyfriend, even after Conway learns details that point in another direction. When he speaks with Conway and Moran, they almost telepathically know what the other is thinking (evidence of a good partnership) and speak to Breslin accordingly.

French has another winner with THE TRESPASSER. I highly recommend it and only do not give it my highest rating because I gave that to BROKEN HARBOR.

I won this book from luxuryreading.com."
"I reviewed this one for Really Into This

This was my first Tana French novel. I definitely need to get with the program, right? This book is #6 in her Dublin Murder Squad Series. I’ve got two of her novels at home that were HIGHLY recommended by a former patient of mine & I’m moving them up the TBR pile after reading this.

I can’t elaborate too much on the story because it is complicated, detailed & intricately woven together. It starts simple enough with a dead gal in an apartment that seems like a domestic crime. But as the 2 detectives piece together the clues, it becomes a real challenge for Antoinette & Steve to sort through all the possible scenarios. French’s writing style takes the reader through every twist & turn & this includes some great dialogue amongst the Murder Squad. If you enjoy police procedurals & love Law & Order I would think this would be up your alley. This book is over 450 pages, (a bit long for me) & requires some dedication & patience from the reader. The pay off is the cast of well written characters. I mean, Antoinette is one tough & ballsy detective- she’s someone you won’t soon forget. She was definitely my favorite part of the book. I can’t imagine fans of French’s work would be disappointed with The Trespasser. It delivers a well crafted mystery as promised."
"When I was little, and I'd managed to get my hands on some grape or orange Bubble Yum or Hubba Bubba, I'd have a pep talk with myself: ""You can DO IT this time!""

It never worked.

The flavor was always so concentrated and intense when I put a piece in my mouth that I both loved and couldn't handle it. I'd try and chew through the candy-like texture until it mellowed out and became actual gum. But it invariably overwhelmed me so much that I'd have to swallow it for some relief.

This is basically the same way I've handled Tana French books—until now. I've finally cracked the code:

1. Listen to the audiobooks* so it's basically impossible to skip ahead and ruin the ending because it's too intense to handle. This way, your anxiety about the whodunnit can stay at bay while you enjoy the experience.
2. Enjoy the story as much as possible, because French can paint a mood like no other, and the wrap-up never quite lives up to the anticipation and atmosphere of the book. The experience is always better than the ending.
3. Pack your suspension of disbelief for the 20 pages of prose-etry dialogue from an ancillary character that will inevitably crack the case wide open 15% from the end.

With French, it's always worth the ride.

*I didn't love the narrator for this one. I couldn't always tell when she had switched characters. But it was still worth it."
"This book messed with my mind in ways that make me love books like this. Red herring cancelled out red herring, bringing about new red herrings that took us to the first few.

This was the second book in the Dublin Murder Squad series in which we followed Conway and Moran. In The Secret Place, we met Conway through Moran’s eyes, and, as it is done with the Dublin Murder Squad, in this book we were in Conways’s mind. Her mind is exhausting. She’s smart as a whip but flips back and forth between who she trusts and who she is convinced is sabotaging her life. She applies this same kind of thinking to her case, which gives the reader quite the ride. I recognized some of Conway’s thinking, with her mind tying itself in knots, in myself. French’s characters always feel personal.

I love Conway and Moran. I loved them in The Secret Place, though the story itself didn’t grab me like this one did. I loved them while reading this book. I wish we could have a whole series about them. But I’ll take another Dublin Murder Squad book, too!"
"Me gusta el desarrollo que hace de la historia, cómo escribe, cómo te vas implicando.
Me gusta esta saga y espero que este no sea el último libro.
El primero me pareció muy fresco y el segundo, aunque la trama me pareció un poco inverosímil, también me tuvo en vilo aunque he de reconocer que tuve problemas con el tercero y el cuarto, estas dos últimas entregas de la saga me han reconciliado con la autora.
Aunque el trasfondo de los libros sea un crimen, realmente no los consideraría como un thriller policiaco. Lo que me interesa es la historia que explica, el trasfondo, los motivos...
"
"Solid four stars - shines, as is usual with Tana French, in the character interactions and inner dialogues, especially when it comes to interrogations in this one. Not my favorite in the series, but much better than the previous one. This one just felt more personal, much smaller in scope, and more grounded. Really enjoyed listening to this!"
"My favorite Dublin Murder Squad novel possibly since The Likeness. I love Antoinette Conway as protagonist so much, and the mystery was interesting and delightfully twisty. I'm feeling the urge to reread the whole series."
"LoVeD this authors voice!! Great dialog & a twisty-turny story that I gobbled up with gusto! Can't wait to read more!!
Rundontwalkandgetyousomemang"
"If someone rescues you, they own you. Not because you owe them—you can sort that, with enough good favors or bottles of booze dressed up in ribbons. They own you because you’re not the lead in your story any more. You’re the poor struggling loser/helpless damsel/plucky sidekick who was saved from danger/dishonor/humiliation by the brilliant brave compassionate hero/heroine, and they get to decide which, because you’re not the one running this story, not any more.

As ever, I am so into Tana French’s gorgeous writing — I mention this in every review, but I save her books as delicious little treats for myself whenever I need to wallow in some lovely prose, great twists and turns, and deeply evocative characterisation. This is the last of the Dublin Murder Squad books out so far, so I’d been dragging my heels on reading it because now I don’t have any more left (!!).

That said: it’s really nice seeing a detective pair from the other side of the duo, providing another POV on the same dynamic (it actually took me a moment to clock that ‘Steve’ was Stephen Moran, now seeing him from the outside). It’s nice catching up with Conway & Moran after The Secret Place, seeing their growing chemistry and how they’ve been settling in as partners since then.

This ride was so riveting, and I found myself just as lost and baffled as Conway, spinning loose without a theory to neatly fit all the pieces. There’s a new angle here which makes things a bit more different than the usual murder formula, and shakes things up and helps keep French’s plot formulas fresh.

French also never really shies away from having her characters fuck up. Antoinette Conway is especially fascinating as an unlikeable female main character, imo: she gets to behave ugly, all her hackles up, without walking on eggshells for other people. She’s relatable and I liked her and was rooting for her, but also, her defensiveness is so defensive that it becomes aggressive again, all prickly and abrasive and independent to a fault, as she shoots herself in the foot and self-sabotages herself. All of these detective protagonists are so damaged, and therefore deeply frustrating at times, but I remain so fond of all of them.

And as evidenced by my quote up there, the recurring theme here is stories, and the stories we tell ourselves, and what happens when we let other people dictate what our stories or identities should be. The lies we tell, and the lies we tell ourselves. The crime at the heart of this novel starts off looking like a pretty basic murder, but then of course it gets more and more complicated as you go along, and it’s so, so compelling watching Conway and Moran have to navigate and manipulate and maneuver around their own squad as well. This also helps keep things fresh: our duo are a pair of rookies on the outs with their colleagues, esp. compared to our previous Murder D, Scorcher, who was practically a poster child for the department, a veteran and a part of the boy’s club, not caught outside with his face pressed against the glass like Conway & Moran are.

Having had my heart destroyed in In the Woods, I had girded myself for this to blow up and go the absolute worst way. I blew through the last third of this book in particular, as things speed up and the stakes ratchet up, and the end was just an addictive ride.

It’s been almost 6 years since this book came out, and no word on another Dublin Murder Squad book — which makes me wonder if French is finally running out of tricks in her box of tricks and just doesn’t feel like writing this particular series anymore, now that she’s turned to standalones. And I know I should probably be happy that all these books were so great before the formula becomes stale, but sigh I still pine for her to return to it someday; I just love this setting, this interlocking universe with minor recurring characters, and how she writes crime.

4.5 stars, only rounded down because it didn’t make me tear up like others in this series have, but tbh you could also round it up to 5 because what even are stars, anyway. I love all these books."
"Found an almost new hardbound edition in the local dump stuff trailer a few weeks ago and started last night. Pretty darned good so far. I have heard and read about Ms. French before, including in The New Yorker. She's pretty hot stuff right now, I gather.

- ""Trespasser"" is the title of another murder mystery(which I have also read), this one by Mainer Paul Doiron, who is fun to read, but not at talented as Ms. French. As is the case with this book, Doiron's books are narrated by the sleuth himself, which provided an attention-getting perspective on things.

Moving along with all the procedural and departmental monkeyshines and it's all very intense and entertaining but ... once again I'm reading a murder mystery in which a little mention of a seemingly/supposedly innocuous incident(or two) creates a nagging little mental voice in my head. Not, apparently, in the heads of Moran and Conway as the author seems to want them(and us) to ignore this until it comes time to NOT ignore it. Very annoying. Not that it's an easy and simple thing to write an original and interesting and logically tight murder mystery, ESPECIALLY if you've already taxed your brain pretty well with five previous books in the series. Right now I'm ready to anoint Ms. French the Hilary Mantel of mystery writers, but we'll see what develops. Right now I'm looking at those little nit-nits and looking at our supposedly smart detectives and thinking COME ON! While we're young!

So ... I just clicked the wrong button and lost everything. Such good stuff too! Oh well ... my main point is that the book's too long, though the good writing helps keep one's interest up. About 50-100 pages fewer would've been better. Ms. French seems to be relying on the goodwill of her readers in laying on all the departmental drama and the mire of investigation procedure(s). That plus the many pages of time spent with Rory, even though we KNOW he didn't do it. Otherwise, why write the book? This is my first Tana French novel so I have no baseline to compare it with. Most of the G'reads reviews are pretty favorable.

- Rory drives a Yaris - me too!

- Det. Conway is the female Harry Hole.

- So far there have been three ""whip around""s and that's three too many.

- In the beginning Steve went off spinning a what-if tale of Aislinn's gangster-lover. At the time my thought was ""what about a secret(married) cop-lover?"" And now look at what's happening (though bugger-all who knows it will actually turn out). I find it annoying when crime/mystery authors steer away from logical pathways in order to (possibly)artificially prolong the story. It's as if they are our story guides saying ""No, no. Don't look at that NOW, we'll get back to that later.""

Finished up last night and am on the fence about my rating. If I give it a 3.5* I becomes a G'reads 3* rating, If I go with 3.75* it rounds up to 4*. If we had six stars to work with this would be a perfect 4* book. Oh well … I did like the endgame pretty well. Seemed about right. Aislynn turned out to be the f'ed up person a damaged soul might well be, but being murdered for it is an outsize penalty to pay. The killer, however sympathetic, has to be punished. Readers will demand that much. The twisty-turny ending was pretty good, I thought. I'll be reading another one some day.

- The final ""whips around"" count was four. Tsk. Tsk."
"This was a pretty great finale. Interestingly, the dynamic duo from the previous book are solidified partners now, though still ostensibly despised by the murder squad. They’re given busy work that turns out to be not a simple Murder. At all. A woman is murdered in a domestic dispute and her best friend thinks it’s a mystery date dude… and that’s about all they have to go on. Only, the more they dig into the victim, the more things don’t add up. Her entire persona seems constructed and the number one suspect is too easy a target.

Meanwhile, the social politics haunt Antoinette, the lead investigator and protagonist. She’s sick to death of her all-male colleagues, continually dealing with the same kind of sexism that we see in the first two books. Not much has changed, but judging from the age of Frank’s daughter in the third book, small world building things like that suggest it’s been a solid while - probably a decade and change. It’s hard for Antoinette to know who to trust. She keeps disintegrating, as the case begins to stall.

It’s a solid book. But my favourite parts of the series have been where it straddles literary lines, usually by deep diving into the past of the characters, which break wide open due to the case. But that doesn’t really happen with this and the previous book. They have their dynamics to negotiate, but it feels much more like genre fiction. It’s a bit tropey and the prose are still great, but I don’t think the character work is up to snuff. And without the past, it kind of feels like the first book, only with a different location and it wanting to address the gaslighting sexism Antoinette deals with, which is how she functions in the previous book, too. I liked the resolution of that. But… it does still feel like a conventional end."
"REVISED

THE TRESPASSER is the first book I have read by Tana French. I will admit I didn't understand why French has received all the hype. After reflection, I think I am getting it.

It is a good police procedural novel, and with that comes the slow and laborious detective work: interviewing numerous suspects and witnesses; ferreting out truths and untruths; culling through photos, computers, etc.; developing theories and scenarios; chasing all kinds of leads (and dead ends)... all of which are time consuming and labor intensive. The reader experiences the tedium of detective work as it is reflected in a lengthy, slow-paced book. The protagonist is not a likable character and her attitude and the huge chip on her shoulder becomes tiresome. Another minor issue is the Irish colloquialisms that are difficult to understand. I give it 3***


French's meticulous details make the reading slow going ( and some would say boring). However, if one does not embrace her writing style, one will miss the intellect and insight she bestows upon the reader. I admit I did, and did not appreciate the second, deeper layer French deftly reveals through the characterization of the players. The interview scenes are remarkably enlightening and intelligent. French develops deep insight into human motives and the psychological mindset of people in this thing called life. Only days later after reading did I realize this is why the reading seemed slow- that second, deeper level. Wow. 5*****

I will read more from Tana French and make time to take the time to savor the profound psychological insights."
"In this book, we spend the whole time inside the head of the main character, Detective Antoinette Conway. Conway is a tough cookie and the only female on the Dublin murder squad.

The story starts out when Conway and her partner are assigned a case in which a young woman is found dead in her own home. The obvious suspect is the boyfriend and that's the man the senior detectives on the Squad want to pursue.

However, Conway and her partner have other suspicions. But they've got their work cut out because they're the newest on the squad. Gangland connections? Corruption within the murder squad? A vendetta to get Conway out? These are all thrown into the mix.

What I enjoyed most was the kick-ass attitude of Conway. At times she's paranoid. At other times, she spot on with her doubts and 'take no shit' temperament. I'm not sure I actually liked her, but I liked spending time with her because she was interesting. Her partner, Stephen Moran, was more soft and likeable. He's a diplomat and he's no fool. Moran could be one of the lads but he's loyal to Conway. Moran's easy going character definitely helps the story along.

The plot delves deeper and deeper into the murky waters of rivalry, deception and high stakes murder. And the reader gets further involved in Conway's one-woman crusade to root out the truth.

This was a slow read for me because it's so intense being inside her head all the time. But the story stayed with me long after I finished the book and I think that shows its quality. Conway made an impression!"
"When Aislinn (pronounced Ashleen – I only know this because I listened to the audio!) is found dead in her home, next to a table set for what looked to be a romantic dinner, the boyfriend is the immediate suspect. But, there might be more to it. Antoinette and Steve are partners on the murder squad, but Antoinette, as the only woman on the squad, has had to take a lot of crap and she’s getting tired of it! Antoinette and Steve are pushed by some of the other detectives to simply arrest the boyfriend and call it a day. But they want an air-tight case.

Another really good book in the series! I also really like the audios of these. I haven’t listened to them all, but I have for many of them, and they are always done really well. I like the Irish accent, too. I also always enjoy the personal stories of the detectives in these books. I was always kept wanting to read more, to find out how things were going to unfold. Really enjoyed this one!"
"I’m now caught up with all of the current Dublin Murder Squad series with book #6, and this last one was a good one. The two lead detectives are Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran, who are trying to solve the murder of a young lady who Antoinette recalls having met previously, and whose mysterious history is also tied up with several other members of the squad. It takes a long time to sort things out, with constant roadblocks being thrown at them by another interfering detective with shady motives. Antoinette carries a lot of resentment and hostility in her attitude, which makes for challenging episodes between the two partners and the rest of the team. The ending was satisfying, and it was a long but enjoyable read."
"I was thinking about giving this three stars because god I just could NOT get into this for such a long time. like this is the only book I think I've ever renewed at the library because the loan was gonna run out, lol. but it's way too well-written for three stars. French just puts so much in her books; her prose is so dense and interesting and demanding of the reader in a good way. like The Witch Elm, I found this book a little too padded out with unnecessary stuff, but again, this was a really good mystery with intriguing, fully realized characters throughout."
"This is not the Dublin I visited a month ago. I’m glad for that! But I enjoyed reading another Dublin murder squad novel. I can’t say without a major spoiler what I most enjoyed about this one, but I can say it involves the powerful men Detective Conway (Antoinette) must deal with on her own squad. Some of the harassment she receives reminded me of Prime Suspect. Bring on the tough women!

PS: I’d last a week tops."
"A classic whodunit police procedural with a lot of twists, solid plot, well-developed characters and some fine writing. Lately, I've been finding European authors doing a better job at this genre than American ones. I'll have to check out more by this author."
"The writing is excellent, as I remember from other Tana French books. The mystery was well done. Some very good red herrings to keep our detectives hopping around. I was not a huge fan of the Conway as a lead. She seems to have huge chip on her shoulder and I just didn’t like the way she dealt with people. I warmed up to her a little by the end. I did like her second though. The case had a good and unexpected resolution that tied up what had happened throughout the book.

"
"My first Tana French book. This is not my favorite genre, but I did enjoy the read. A murder detective in Ireland struggles with her own squad and the murder of a young woman that she feels like she has met before.

Audio version:very good, but it takes awhile to adjust to the VERY Irish accent"
"Nothing mind blowing, main character/narrator pissed me off so bad. But set in Ireland so I loved it obviously 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪"
"I have a new author to read! Tana French. Dublin Murder Squad. Very good. Meaty, full of twists, kept my interest until the very end. The audio was very good, nice authentic accent. "
3.5 rounded up
"This was my first Tana French novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It follows a young Dublin Murder Squad detective, Antoinette, as she tries to solve the murder of a young woman. Meanwhile Antoinette must cope with intense harassment from within her Squad, which leads her on wild goose chases during the investigation. Antoinette is a wonderful character! Her dialogue is peppered with entertaining Irish profanity; I didn't understand many of the expressions, but that didn't matter because her emotions came through. French did a marvelous job of depicting Antoinette as strong and feisty, but vulnerable and human, too. The other characters are well-developed and believable as well. French also has an excellent literary flair; thoughtful and lovely passages are scattered throughout the book. The plot is a little low-key and was a little slow for my taste, especially at the end. Still, an entertaining read. "
"После провальной пятой книги в серии про дублинский отдел убийств Френч снова на коне. На этот раз перед нами классиче��кий процедурный детектив. Девушка убита в своем доме, кто-то позвонил и сообщил об этом. Двое детективов-новичков (и изгоев) берутся за дело, и мы следим за всеми перепетиями их расследования. Дело запутанное, улик почти нет, свидетелей тоже, внутри их отдела им строят козни их же коллеги.

В общем, полный набор удачного детектива, несколько интересных твистов, все ружья развешаны и стреляют в нужное время. По сравнению с предыдущими книгами, тут почти нет внутренних страданий и описания жизней жертв или детективов, и фокус в первую очередь именно на расследовании. Получается увлекательно и живо. При этом личности детективов играют большую роль и в целом хорошо прописаны, что превращает это не в чисто функциональную книжку, где мы читаем ради разгадки.

Не могу сказать, что это полный восторг, но вполе добротно и интересно. Из минусов только пара моментов, где детективы упускают вещи, совершенно очевидные читателю, при этом совсем не в характере самих героев (и там ясно, что это ляп автора — она сама увлеклась написанием и не продумала). Но они не портят общего впечатления."
"This book made me want to go back and read all of Tana French's books. This was my first book by her, and I know that's out of order, but it was my book club's pick, and I knew you didn't really *need* to read the others in the series to understand it. However, after finishing it, I want to go back and follow the evolution of the Murder Squad and find out more stuff about it, and hear about Conway through the eyes of other squad members. I was pretty amazed by how deeply invested I was in the characters without the background knowledge, and by how much I laughed out loud--Conway was funny.

I'd say my only quibble with it was the resolution to the mystery itself. I'm just not sure I bought the way it all came together. I'll be curious to hear what others at book club have to say about that. Regardless, I'm now a fan of Tana French and plan on reading the rest of her books soon."
"As usual, great to get to know some characters with such depth and realism to them.

I just had a great time looking at the questions people have offered up about this book, especially spoilery ones. One really gave me a solid few moments to reflect on the book and who the Trespasser of title note actually is.

As usual, I took a more literal approach, where the trespasser was the one stalking Conway's door. But there were a lot of meanings that went deeper, such as a trespass being a sin, as with killing someone, and trespassing across invisible lines and boundaries of moral transgressions or society rules. Very thought-provoking, and I'm glad I came across the discussion so I could think on it a bit. French is definitely one of those authors who will give you a good few mouthfuls to chew on, and the deeper you go, the richer the morsels you find."
"Tana French hears the poetry in the way people actually talk. Although this is a highly literary novel, it sticks scrupulously to the crunchy, profane language her characters would use in real life. I also love the way French reports on the weather, what people are wearing, and what their apartments look like. If I have a complaint, it's that the murder victim's motivations and behavior are completely ludicrous. But you only discover what they were in the last quarter of the book, and by that time you're so hooked on the writing, you'd follow French anywhere.

A note to other French newbies: this was the first Dublin murder squad novel I'd read, and it absolutely held up as a standalone. I didn't once feel confused or alienated by my ignorance of the first five installments (although I'm sure reading those would have enriched the experience of reading this one)."
"The Trespasser literally kept me up all night until I finished it; crawled into bed at 5 a.m.
To be honest, it seemed as though the murder mystery was semi-solved at the very beginning (or at least one of the ""reputable"" characters seemed to be a little too shady), but then the story and the characters become a bit more complex. I thought into the story that Superintendent O'Kelly might pull a James Comey ... you'll have to read the book to discover O'Kelly's loyalties.
Number 6 in the Dublin series, Tana French's Murder Squad detectives have traded the spotlight within the series, and the stories are as much about the frailties and the psyches of the detectives themselves as the murders within each case history. A favorite author.
"
"There is not much to like about Detective Antoinette Conway which is often enough to make a read a nonstarter for me. Told in the 1st person, Conway's voice is in your head the whole time, and if you are like me, you DO get sick of her. Luckily she has a partner- the understated intuitive Steven Moran and, boy! does he make up for her deficits. So it ends up being an engaging story after all. I'd say the theme of this police procedural is Fathers -whether they can be trusted or not -whether you should let your life rotate around that relationship given how it turns out for you. The bit with 'the Gaffer' at the end- talk about the omnipotent father!"
" The Trespasser  was a very deserving finish to the  Dublin Murder Squad  series. After the disappointment of the previous book, I was a bit hesitant to get to this. But I need not have feared, the thrill, the emotions and the depth were back. I was captivated from the beginning and while I really hoped that  Rory would be innocent, I did not really predict the culprit . A captivating read with well-developed characters and definitively not your usual detective stories."
"""I wear good suits, stuff that’s cut right and works with my shape—long and strong—and anyone who thinks I should be schlepping around in a sack to protect him from his own bad thoughts can fuck himself. The stuff people think I should try to hide—being tall, being a woman, being half whatever—is the stuff I keep up front and in their faces. If they can’t handle it, I can use that.""

"Didn't realize this was part of a series until I came to write the review. Certainly stands on its own, but makes me want to read the others. The dialogue (especially interrogation and interview scenes) was strong. (The Irish slang did have me a little puzzled at first). Drags a little in middle- don't think it needed to be 400+ pgs. "
"I have to say that the one thing that makes me sad when finishing a Tana French novel is knowing that I'll never get to return to the narrator's perspective again. I always end up loving the protagonist so much, and would read a whole series with each of them as a narrator, though I know I'll go along to the next book and feel the same way about another detective. "
"A nice bounce-back from the fifth book in the series. A lot of the characters in this book--including the main one, Antoinette Conway, aren't particularly likable, but French does a great job of making it all hang together. (And as far as that goes, whether or not characters are likable has little to do with the quality of writing) A little overlong, but worth the read."
"4 solid stars!!

Well, well, well... My faith in Tana French has returned!!!! I was meh with her last book. It was predictable and annoying. This one hooked me from the start and didn't let go for the entire ride!!! Just like the French I fell in love with."
"Tana French writes well and designs plots that are captivating. I have read all of the Murder Squad series. At first it drove me crazy the way she moves and removes main characters, instead of carrying them along through all the books.
Good story."
"I wasn't aware that I was reading book six of a series until I decided to write this review, because ""Trespasser"" is a stand-alone story. I'm not the biggest fan of crime-solving yarns, but Tana French has a unique voice that I absolutely enjoyed."
"As with all Tana French books, pulled me in quickly, great writing, great plot. (And a far more believable plot than The Likeness....)"
So much fun! I LOVE the lead character so much.
"This is the first book I have read/listened to in the Dublin Murder Squad. I listened to this one and must say it was long and slow. In The Trespasser, Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are assigned what they think is a run-of-the-mill domestic dispute gone horribly awry. When they arrive at the flat they observe that there is no forced entry and they find out that Aislinn Murray had a man coming over that evening. As the story moves forward, they are concerned that Detective Breslin, a more experienced officer in the Murder Squad, wants them to arrest the boyfriend right away. He keeps telling them it is obvious, but despite his pushing, they continue to investigate and look into things determined to do a good job gathering evidence and finding the true culprit.

From reading other reviews, it seems this was not one of Tana French's better books. The story is slow, with a lot of dialogue and use of expletives. I enjoyed getting to know the two main characters in this story, who are very well described. I loved getting to know Antoinette Conway, the female detective in a male dominated department. She is the only female detective who has made it to the Murder Squad and is constantly trying to prove herself. She and her partner Steve Moran are well matched. He seems docile, yet is a smart detective and knows when to step up and take the lead, otherwise he is happy letting her do it. Just like real life, detective work is a lot of interviewing and questioning in this story and that makes it a bit boring, until the last quarter of the story, which moves along at an extremely quick pace. There are several suspects and when the culprit is revealed, it is surprising. I did not figure it out until it became obvious in the story. I do wish that I had started with the first book instead of midway into this series to learn more about the Murder Squad. I listened to this book and once I became accustomed to the Irish lilt, I enjoyed the narration very much."
"This book has been calling my name for a while. I found a used copy for sale because our library didn’t have it. I gave in and did something of a marathon read. This was the book after The Secret Place which I read several years ago and didn’t like that much. At the time I thought it was overly long, plus the subject matter: spoiled teenagers at an elite private school wasn’t one of my favorites. It is a subject that is often revisited in modern British crime novels that examine the elitism of the British school system. (I still remember reading a blog post by an American who was moving to Scotland for a period and decided to home school after checking out the local “comprehensive” school.) This book, The Trespasser, brings back the two detectives in the case, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. Both are products of the working class that is so often looked at with disdain in Great Britain and, apparently, in Ireland as well. Conway is actually mixed race which makes her even more of a target and she is prickly as a result. She is also tall, something that men often find intimidating.

In this book, Conway and Moran are part of the Dublin Murder Squad and still, after two years, still considered “newbies.” They work the night shift which means lots of “domestics” with predictable results. Then one day, just as they are ready to call it a night and go home, the boss (known as the Gaffer) gives them a case of a young woman murdered in her home. Conway figures it’s going to be yet another “domestic,” but it turns out to be far more complicated than that. The victim, Aislinn Murray, is, as the book jacket says, young, pretty and dead. She was preparing dinner for a new boyfriend when she died. So of course the boyfriend is a prime subject. But he denies it and there is no real evidence linking him to her.

However, an experienced detective who has been assigned to the case to help them thinks the boyfriend is a good fit and is doing everything he can to fit him to the case. Antoinette wonders why. We also learn some personal facts about Antoinette and why she is so prickly. She and Aislinn have one thing in common: both of their fathers abandoned them at a young age.

This was really riveting although it wasn’t nearly as dark as her earlier novels. I hope she brings Conway and Moran back again. It would be interesting to see them evolve."
"This is my sixth Murder Squad book, and unlike many of the other, there was no magicky, hocusey-pocusey stuff mixed in. Thank goodness, because that would really have been off-putting in this particular book because it would have had no place in the plot. (Although I question the whole electricity-controlling thing in ""The Secret Place"" having anything to do with the plot, but since that plot depended on the strong relationship between four teenage girls, it was not completely out of place).
The protagonist, Antoinette Cooper, was well drawn, and I admire that French did not succumb to giving her any overly tender moments - she really never broke character. I think the French was smart too by giving the reader Moran to balance out the Cooper character.
And although I copped on to the murderer fairly quickly (hee), it was a great plot point. Once Cooper realized whodunnit, then that opened all new sorts of plot possibilities, and I could not stop listening to see how French would end the book.
I like the Murder Squad setting, and I love the Irish slang. Someone wrote in another review that French is giving the Murder Squad series a rest and making her next novel something completely different. I will follow her there because I think she is a good writer, but I hope it is not another Girl-On-The-Train wannabe. Don't let me down, Tana!

PS - Does anyone remember - was Breslin a character in another book? I also found it a little odd that Cooper never mentions her work on the Secret Place murder."
"Stripped of the expert depictions of psychological manipulation in police interrogations and the examples of gaslighting in workplace interactions, the plot of this procedural is, frankly, ridiculous. The circumstances around the actual crime are almost laughably convoluted and unrealistic. But I found myself squirming uncomfortably (and enjoyably) as the suspects and witnesses are operated like marionettes by the cynical and hardened detectives who know just what buttons to push and just what inflections to use to break down people's defenses. I especially liked the self-conscious narration of main character Antoinette Conway that added additional layers and insights to this aspect of police work . In the interrogation room, every choice from the width of the table to the presence (or absence) of coffee to the placement of a coat over a chair is designed to shake the confidence and resolve of the subject. The decision about whether to visit a witness first thing in the morning or later in the day matters. And does the witness seem as if she's smoking more than usual, or less than usual? And what if she bites her lip? It's all significant. And when detectives turn those tactics and powers of observation against each other, it becomes a battle of wills that causes you to question everything and trust nobody (even the narrator). The answer to the question ""Who killed Aislinn Murray?"" is less important (and less interesting) than experiencing the methods used to get there. "
"I have been reading Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series since 2011 so memory may deceive me, but I think The Trespasser is possibly the tensest Tana French novel to date…and I am not referring to the mystery in its pages. For me as a reader, the story of who done it was eclipsed by the narrator’s, Detective Antoinette Conway, arc: is she right or is she paranoid?

As in the previous book, Conway is still partnered with Stephen Moran, only she takes over the narration in this one. The only female detective on the squad, Conway has been physically and mentally harassed by her co-workers from day one and at the beginning of this book, she is at the breaking point. She is seeing conspiracies and back-stabbers everywhere and this paranoia affects her ability to solve the case. I was proverbially biting my nails for most of the book, terrified that she was going to put her foot wrong and upend everything. And French did an excellent job keeping the reader unsteady…doubting Conway on one page and believing her interpretation on the next.

The solution to the actual mystery that Conway and Moran are tasked with solving, the possible manslaughter/possible murder of a young woman, was for me less successful or rather less believable that the character study of abrasive, ambitious Antoinette Conway. I also grew a little tired of Conway’s lack of vocabulary: never boss or superior, always “gaffer”, the constant use of the words “hole” and “shite”. But on the other hand, it is the strength of this novel that while I found Conway to be in many ways a very narrow and unpleasant person, Tana French’s writing made her a believable and compelling narrator, despite her unpleasantness."
"The Trespasser has a lot of surprises I wasn’t expecting. Overall, this is a pretty great cap-off to the Dublin Murder Squad series. If Tana French wants to write more books in this series I would say YES PLEASE and I wouldn’t mind another from Antoinette’s perspective. She’s biting, sarcastic, and self-sabotaging, but she’s real and has heart and I enjoyed her. And Steve is great.

The murder and situation surrounding it are interesting and it held my attention for the most part, though at times the story seemed doughy when it could have been trimmed or streamlined. There was one incident that came completely out of nowhere and I understand it’s purpose but it was awkwardly placed and executed. The last fourth of the novel goes to some unexpected places and it’s so insightful a little heartbreaking, and just downright exciting to read.

French writes in such an atmospheric way that you can feel the grind of Antoinette’s emotions. I also really appreciated the thematic commentary on men doing what they think is right and making decisions for women, how that’s not their place to do so, and the consequences of that.

"
"Let's just start with, 'I will read absolutely anything Tana French writes.' And I’ve read them all. Theoretically, this would include shopping lists and birthday cards, whatever - I don't care. She works in eerie-detective genre, but in truth, it's more of a literary approach than by-the-numbers plots & characters. Her facility with words, with storytelling, are gifts to treasure. (If you're new to Tana French, start with her first book, IN THE WOODS - she owned me after the first paragraph of the Prologue.)

All the other books? I've stayed up through the night to finish them, then immediately went back to page 1 just for the pleasure of rereading. This book's different. Same setting, Dublin Murder Squad, but a tough new D (detective) in Conway, a woman and (unspecified) bi-racial. Naturally, she doesn't fit well with the good ol' boys of the Squad and their hostility, entitlement and harassment are fully in play.

French is so good with plot, character, dialogue, setting and how she puts words together that Conway is not a typical tough-but-feminine, plays-nice officer. Her toughness comes from well-tended barriers and reads as completely believable. This is a good thing, because fully half the book is the setup and introduction of characters. Slow moving - so you get to discover puzzle pieces of backstory. You get to wonder why TF Conway or her partner, Moran, would do this or ignore that. Same goes for the rest of the squad members, too, the victim, her best friend (or is she?), the primary suspect and a handful of others.

You get a strong feel for the squad room, for the crime scene, for the frustrations and details and roadblocks of police procedure. And as with all of French's books, you get fistfuls of Irish slang and police terminology and you just have to figure it out. Not a problem; it's one of the things that brings the authenticity of the setting to the forefront.

But the first half of the book meanders, no question, before the temperature gets turned up with a series of explosive revelations - so I didn’t read it in a sprint, but then I pushed some projects aside to finish it.

Here, Conway's in the interview room with their only choice for a primary suspect (though she's not convinced, because he's an astonishing wimp):

""I'm amazed this guy managed to get out of bed in the morning without working himself into a panic attack over the chance that he might trip on the bath mat and stab himself through the eye socket with his toothbrush and be left with a permanent twitch that'll ruin his chances of landing an airplane safely if the pilot has a heart attack and doom hundreds to a fiery death. Normally this shit makes me roll my eyes, but here it's gonna come in useful, as soon as we're ready to start pushing.

What-if-maybe crap is for weak people. ... Every what-if is a gift to anyone who's looking for a hold on you, and that means us.""

For a while, wasn't sure I could relate to Conway - not only the protagonist but also the narrator - but ended up appreciating the fact that it took me a while to get her. French writes in Conway's voice, noticeably different from her other books, but no less masterful."
"Mention the name Tana French to anyone who has read her books, and you will hear, ""I love her books!"" Well, me too.

Antoinette Conway is a detective in the Dublin Garda's Murder Squad. She experienced childhood trauma and is determined not to ever again allow someone else to limit or direct her life. She relies on no one and expects the worst from everyone. The latter can be a useful quality when dealing with murder suspects, but it's hell on relationships, partners, family, and co-workers. She is emphatically NOT one of the boyos on the squad. When she's assigned to a twisty murder case, she sees sabotage and resistance to her efforts at all levels. But is that really what's going on?

Ainslinn Murray is the murder vic in that twisty case. She too had a childhood trauma and is reacting to it, but in a much different way. It's a pleasure to watch Antoinette's journey toward understanding where her path parallels Ainslinn's and where it departs. As always, the author packs the book with Irish slang and colloquialisms, which make it so much fun to read.

I love Tana French's books."
"I love a good old procedural from time to time. Throw in a bit of the Irish and well, what's not to love.

On Audio, narrator Hilda Fey knocks it out of the park!

An anonymous caller leads to the dead body of young Aislinn Murray. Who killed Aislinn and who called it in and why? Detective Antionette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran work together in this well done police procedural to find her killer, digging through her spotlessly clean apartment and into her murky past.

Detective Conway is the odd one out in her male dominated murder squad. She finds that she is often left out of the loop and the target of “pranks” that aim to make her look foolish or worse. She comes across as super aggressive and not particularly likable to the people she works with. Her partner is the yin to her yang, very easy going, willing to put up with her grouchy demeanor.

The story has a nice pace, walking the reader through theories and procedures, interviews and records requests, all while dropping enough bread crumbs to keep the reader following along.

The interplay between the characters is great; the way she knows what an expression means or knowing intuitively how her fellow detective will ask the next question lends to the feeling that you have walked into a relationship instead of just a scene.

There are many twists and turns, character quirks and missteps to make this a really good read."
"Uit! Tussen de 4 & 5 sterren.

Na het vorige deel dat me teleurstelde, was dit juist weer alles wat ik in een Tana-French-detective zoek. Grappig genoeg met dezelfde detective-paar als in deel 5, maar nu met een focus op Corman.

Psychologie, puzzelen, meer beweging (dat miste ik in het vorige deel nogal), spanning, diepere lagen verbonden met persoonlijke geschiedenis van de detectives (dat miste ik ook een beetje in het vorige deel, dat het echt de diepte in ging), rijke taal: loved it. Hoop dat er nog meer delen komen in deze serie (en hoop ook nog steeds stiekem op een nieuw deel met Cassie of Rob uit deel 1). Al mogen Antoinette en Stephen ook nog wel een keer langskomen in een nieuw boek vind ik. In dit deel wisten ze me wél mee te trekken en ben ik toch fan van ze geworden."
"4 stars.


“Then I sit there, running the heat to try and thaw my feet after Lucy’s flat, and watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone.”


An incredible ending to an incredible series."
Probably may favorite Tana French book that I have read so far. It was faster paced than her previous novels and started winding up the tension right from that start. Antoinette is a character full of sharp edges but I think that is part of what I loved about her and I was really happy with how her story wrapped up and her character growth. I did figure out the mystery about halfway through but instead of ruining the surprise it made the book more exciting as all the cards fell into place. One of the best mystery books I have read in a while. 
"I've been a huge fan of Tana French from the day I finished her first book, and she hasn't disappointed me yet. Some readers have said this is their new favorite by French. I can't go that far since parts of this story dragged for me. The interviews seemed interminable at times and Antoinette's paranoid ideas got on my nerves a bit. But the end was riveting. Even when we knew the whodunit, I didn't know how it would turn out. That is just how it should be."
"I liked this book, which is the last one in the series...for now. This was a normal murder investigation up until the end where there was an unexpected twist and it was fun seeing how it all played out. Conway is still not my favorite detective but she works well beside Moran. Probably my second favorite in the series after The Likeness."
"I love how all of Dublin Murder Squad books are about people and not just the crime, but the story moves ahead as the crime unfolds bit by bit. All the books have a bit of a fantasy element, but it's surprising how well it fits into the lives involved in the story. In the end, motive's found, crime's solved, but it's the people you're left with to ponder on."
"You read Tana French books first for the voice (each book is narrated by a different protagonist with a very different voice) and secondly for the plot. Sometimes, as in Faithful Place, both the voice and plot are excellent. In Secret Place, the voice was boring but the plot was fascinating. In book 6, the voice is wonderful (efficient, angry Toni Conway, the only female on the Murder Squad), while the mystery itself is not terribly interesting. But I loved being in Toni's sometimes difficult company."
"DAMN this woman can write dialog! I wanted to avoid work and sleep to follow the momentum that built from the very start. The “who the hell was it then” swirled like Dublin dust. The dialect put me right smack into the characters even though I didn’t understand all of the terms. Aislinn Murray appears to be a pathetic wannabe who was killed in a sad lovers tiff. Um, maybe. "
"This took longer than anticipated because it was 470 pages of such small writing 😂😂

Good twists and turns and plot but pretty wordy and in places I felt like slapping Conway and her ‘poor me’ attitude.

New to Murder squad and two Detectives out to prove themselves against the rest of the squad who don’t seem to like them and hamper them every step of the way. Great interrogation scenes"
"I love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books. I even enjoyed The Likeness, despite it having maybe the silliest idea for a murder investigation in literary history. I just love her cops, being cops. Talking smart to each other like the Dubliners they are, and being razor sharp and good at their jobs.

Like many of her books, the plot reveals on the road towards the unmasking of the killer include a fair amount of eye-rollers, but as always (imo) it's the journey, and of course I loved this book. I think it may be her last DMS book, which is sad. Four stars."
"Is this book good? Absolutely! Is it my favorite Tana French/Dublin Murder Squad book? Nope. Is it worth reading? Yes, especially if you like police procedurals, office politics, and characters who are a bit rough around the edges. Loved the partner dynamic between Conway and Moran best of all. "
"Tana French always delivers novels full of suspense, multiple twists and turns, and unparalleled insight into her character's feelings and thought processes. For readers of mystery novels and crime fiction who are not too much into the action stuff and more interested in theories and character development and who, of course, like to imagine themselves into gritty, grimy, beautiful Dublin."
Another Tana French murder mystery set in Ireland. Did not disappoint!
I read mysteries about three or four times a year. I don't like violence or serial killers or too much suspense even (old fuddy duddy) but I love the way mysteries teach me to drive the story forward. I could not put this book down. The suspense is mostly psychological with lots of self-deception on the main character's part. 
4.5 really - yet another great one from Tana French. 
"4 Stars - Excellent book

I'm surprised that every one of French's books I've read thus far (all six of the Murder Squad) have hit it out of the park. I didn't know authors could consistently produce hits. This book kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat until the very end. I can't say anything other than, if you haven't started reading French what are you waiting for?!"
Antoinette und Steve sind mein Lieblingsteam ... aber was für ein Ende. Mein Gott. 
https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/202...
"3.5 stars. This is a slow burn that took me a while to get into. But once I did, I was hooked."
"una vez, más Tana consigue mantenernos a ciegas capítulo a capítulo y no dejarnos ver la luz del misterio hasta las últimas 60 páginas…
( a veces el desarrollo se hace un poco lento, pero aun así lo he disfrutado mucho)"
"Questa ""serie"" mi mancherà tantissimo."
4.5 audiobook 
"I like Tana French's books when I want a mystery or thriller with some meat to it. Her books make me think. The characters are always true to life and a bit flawed, and this book did not disappoint. "
"The way Tana French always finds a way to have wildly different yet parallel stories happening between the lives of the victims or suspects and the private lives of the detectives is not only pretty incredible, but it's handled so delicately that even when it's pointed out, it never feels clumsy or like she's tooting her own horn for being clever. And even though I found Antoinette fairly unlikable in the middle chunk of this book, I still ended up won over and wishing for more and sad that it's over."
"Tana French writes another gritty mystery. The layers of each novel from the undercurrents in the Murder Squad, the personalities of each Detective to the details of solving each mystery!!
She had me all the way to the last page!!!"
"Tough-but-damaged female cop, trying to make it in a man's world, trying to solve a case of an attractive young woman found dead in her home. It's a bit of a cliché, isn't it? A bit stereotyped? Except that, in Tana French's hands, it's not. She takes a little bit of thriller, a little bit of mystery, a little bit of police procedural...and then she throws in excellent plotting, superb prose and exceptionally good character-building and delivers a wonderfully-satisfying read that leaves you wanting to drive to her house and demand the manuscript for the next book Right Now.

I think Faithful Place is still my favourite book in the series, but this one might be edging In The Woods into a (very commendable) third-place spot. Damnit, I'm going to have to read the entire series again, aren't I?"
"Not as strong as the previous books, but still brilliant.

Breaking the recipe from the other books we continue directly with the detective team from the previous book, just shifting character from Moran to Conway which also uncharacteristic is the single POV throughout the book.

There’s a very slow buildup in the first half of the book which feels a little drawn out, but the second half is brilliant.

The interrogation scenes and the parallels French creates between the victim and our detective is my favourite parts"
"I still like Conway.
I can't believe there wasn't any weird supernatural shit in this one! And no main character left the police force in disgrace!"
"After Into the Woods, I was ready for more and found it again here - after not as intriguing French’s novels (2&3). Conway and Moran twist this murder case back and around, with too many ifs?, going too far? But the end opens up in a way that leads on to the next and others. "
"This is another fun installment of the Dublin Murder squad, this time from the point of view of Detective Antoinette Conway. This one dragged for a bit, right around the middle—so much so that I *almost* gave up and stopped reading. A friend told me it would pick back up, so I stuck with it. It started moving again, and I really enjoyed the rest of the story. "
I have very complicated feelings but Tana French was brilliant as always so it gets 4 stars for now 
"This wasn't as batshit or ""wtf"" as Frenchs other books so for that reason I gave it a four. Her writing is still the bomb, and dialogue you can hear in an Irish accent in your head. I love how not everything is tidied up in a neat little package. Someone make this series into a television experience already! "
"Excellent

Really good stories swirling around one death. Murder or accident? Did this one do it, cause it or was it that one? Love or hate? Attraction or revulsion? Real or imagined? The story will keep you answering and your answers may or may not change."
"I was swept away by this brilliantly written novel. Normally a ""bedtime reader,"" I found myself stealing moments during the day to read it - even if only a few pages. In fact, I hold French personally responsible for my messy house, overflowing laundry basket, and leaf-covered yard. Her books should come with a caveat: ""Author not responsible for readers' inattentiveness to their usual responsibilities while reading this book."" ;-)

Why only 4 stars? Several scenes could have benefitted from a little editing, but only a ""half-star worth."" Alas, Goodreads does not offer 1/2 star ratings, or I would have given The Trespasser a 4 1/2."
"Once again Tana French swept me away to her world of the Dublin Murder Squad. I have to admit that this one had me worried in the beginning. I was not at all fond of detective Antoinette Conway's mental state. She seemed to regress from the previous novel where she was the narrator. She was completely paranoid that everyone on the squad was out to get her kicked off. She was even doubting her new partner Steven Moran after they'd gone through so much. I was thinking this would be the book in the series that would only get 3 stars from me. This one was also a bit different in that we spent a lot of time inside the murder squad with all of its politics....usually this isn't the case and the story is developed ""in the field."" I shouldn't have worried as by the middle to end I couldn't put it down. There were some dialogue sections between the detectives that were really telling. Another interesting note is that my dog's name is Breslin which was the name of a main character... so that was fun. I did end up with another 4 star rating from a favorite author. Her murder mysteries continue to be a step above in writing for me. They are so complicated and yet believable. I'm sad that I only have one left to finish the series. I hope she is writing more!"
"About half way through the book, I'd have given it 3 stars. The story kind of slowed down at that point and I was getting a little tired of Detective Conway's paranoia. But the last third of the book was really good - suspenseful with some surprises. I'm not a big mystery or crime book fan, but I do like Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. She could do with a little more editing, but still worth reading. I especially recommend listening to these books, because they're done with the Irish brogue which really enhances the feel of the story."
"Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad is a consistently well-written and entertaining psychological suspense series. The latest entry, The Trespasser, is another winner. While not my personal favorite in the series, it is nevertheless a terrific read with French’s trademark plot twists and deep delving into the minds of both the victims and the cops who investigate the crimes.

Since the first book in the series, French has taken a secondary figure from an earlier book and made them the lead in the next one. The Trespasser is told from the perspective of Antoinette Conway, the lone female detective on the murder squad. Along with her partner, Stephen Moran, they are called in to investigate what looks to be a routine domestic incident that led to the death of a young woman, Aislinn Murray. It wouldn’t be much of a story if it were actually a routine incident, so of course it is not.

The boyfriend is an obvious suspect, but Conway sees an unusual amount of secrets in the victim’s life, and finds the pressure from within the squad to make a quick arrest of the boyfriend likewise suspicious. Complicating matters is the harassment Conway routinely receives from her own squad. This causes her to suspect that she may be being misled so that she will make a mistake which will lead to her either quitting or being fired. But is the mistake acting too quickly or not acting quickly enough with an obvious suspect in front of her?

In the first part of the story, we learn of the possible presence of a “mystery man” in Aislinn’s life. The evidence is scant enough that it’s possible he doesn’t exist. This fuels Conway’s paranoia. At various points she begins to suspect everyone on the murder squad to be out to get her, even coming to believe that her partner wouldn’t mind seeing her gone. It’s in this early part that I felt the story suffered a little in comparison to previous entries in the series. Conway’s introspective paranoia began to stray from legitimate grievances to self-pitying wallowing. Whether this was a result of or caused by a lot more of the novel spending time within the actual police headquarters as compared to the other books I’m not sure. The time spent focusing on Conway’s relationship with the squad seemed to slow what we were learning about Aislinn’s life to a trickle.

The story picks up the pace at about the halfway point and we begin to see more solid evidence of there being more to Aislinn than meets the eye. Some of the most entertaining parts of French’s books are the investigatory dead ends that rather than being throwaways, are part of the sifting and winnowing that allows the true story to emerge and lead to the solving of the crime. Likewise, there is a jumping back and forth in time, as events in the victim’s past shine a light on the crime in the present.

As Conway and Moran close in on the murderer, not only does Aislinn as a victim come into tragic focus, but Conway gets clarity on her own place in the squad and is able to interpret events a little more realistically.

One of the things that French does best in her novels is to drive home the tragedy and pointlessness of these crimes. She also shows how events deep in the past have shaped these persons lives; victims, perpetrators and investigators. The open question is whether once started on this path, was tragedy always inevitable? French makes you care about these characters and feel the pain of the choices they made. Hope comes in the form of the lessons the detectives learn along the way and the chance that it alters their perspective enough to change their own path.

The Trespasser is another great read from French and perfect for anyone who enjoys psychological suspense. I’ll keep reading as long as she keeps writing. Highly recommended.

I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of this book.

"4 stars

I absolutely love Tana French!!!! I truly loved reading this book, the only problem is now I'm super annoyed that I have to wait as long as it takes for her to write another!!! I just hope she writes fast!

As always, she pulls a minor character or two out of one of her previous books and expands on their story while they go through the process of solving a murder case in the city of Dublin. This time she chooses Antoinnette Conway, a 'rough around the edges' murder detective and her partner Steven Moran, who pairs well with her because he is easy going and able to tolerate her prickly personality. Antoinnette is definitely not a favorite detective in the murder squad. Her initial encounter with one of the more senior, established detectives left a bad taste in his mouth and he is determined to sabotage her reputation, career and her standing with the rest of the squad. Steven is new to the squad and seems to be fairly well liked, the only strike against him is the fact that he gets along well with Antoinnette.

The book centers around what appears to be a very easily solved domestic violence murder, but of course, the closer they look, the more it seems there may be more to the story...

What I loved:
Loved the whole Ireland setting. I love all things from Great Britan.
Loved the detective jargon and the glimpse into their world.
Loved the suspense. It kept me guessing.
Loved the complicated relationships between the characters. You never knew who was for or against whom and which alliances were solid.
I really enjoyed the characters who were involved in the murder mystery part of the book; Aislinn, Lucy and Rory. They were all more than just a little bit 'off' in their own way. Reading about them and trying to figure them out made the story even more interesting.
Although I did not like Antoinnette a whole lot, she was written sympathetically enough so I did pull for her and care about what happened to her. There were plenty of times when I wished I could have told her to stop being so bitchy, but I didn't want to see her lose. She was a complex character; she could (and regularly did) verbally rip pretty much anyone and everyone to shreds, didn't care what anyone thought of her and was kind of a bad ass; yet shecame home every night and called her mom. I found most of her personality to be at odds with that.
Loved Steven and Antoinette's relationship. Just plain loved Steven. I loved the way he played 'dumb country boy ' when it would help him, it made suspects and his coworkers .under estimate him until it worked in his favor to stop paying dumb.

What I didn't love:
Some parts of the book were a little cheesy.
Aislinns plan, which set the whole thing in motion, seemed a little far fetched to me but I was able to not let it ruin the book for me. Anyone who would go to that extent definitely had major issues that would be hard to hide.

If you like suspense without over the top blood and gore, and the kind of books that are hard to put down, with exactly the right amount of twists, where the emphasis is on the characters and the plot is always more complex than expected; you'll love this book. If you like all the above and haven't read Tana French yet, you need to download the series and start right away."
"Not my favorite of Tana French's Murder Squad books, but still good nonetheless. Felt it took a little bit longer to get into the story and characters. "
"This is the first Tana French mystery that I have NOT rated as 5. This book was slow - a lot of stuff that was not relevant to the mystery. A member of the Murder Squad tried to mis-direct Steve Moran and Antoinette Conway, both detectives that we have seen before. A beautiful young woman is murdered in her home. The man she had invited for dinner knocks on her door, phones her and finally gives up because he thinks she has dumped him. Later he is the prime suspect in her killing. Her best friend is reluctant to tell all she knows. The mystery is great, withheld info, misleading info, who to believe - and a lot of self-doubt from Conway which gets boring. As usual, Tana French is a great writer but she needed an editor to cut some of this. The mystery part could not be better!"
"Once again, a terrific installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I thought it was going to be predictable, and at one point I have to admit I was ready to put the book down because I thought I had the big mystery all figured out...ha. Tana French put her now-signature twists in here, and the mystery ended up taking several turns that were definitely not predictable. Really hope she continues this series!"
"What’s not to love about Tana French?

I’ll tell you.

Nothing.

I got my hands on this pretty book around the time it came out and it took me months to read it. Months to read my favorite author. For pretty much the reasons you would expect. It will be so good. Once I read it, it’s over. It’s dense and heart thumping. I need to focus all of my attention on it. I need to be in the mood. I need a lot of time to set aside so I can read through the night.

The Trespasser, French’s sixth book in her Dublin Murder Squad series, is no exception. And while other ones might be more of my favorite (Faithful Place and In The Woods for instance) I would read/buy/hug anything French puts out because even my least favorite books of hers are still amazing.

So let’s get to it.

This book is about murder and it’s not about murder at all. I really liked this book because our chief detective, Antoinette Conway, is hard as nails and bitter. She’s the only female on the squad and is constantly getting abused and criticized for it, or so she thinks. Her partner, Stephen Moran is the golden boy, who balances Conway out. Who is the clear thinker and calm partner.

The book really centers around Antoinette and the way she handles the case with her partner. When things don’t add up, and her guts tells her something is amiss, we see Antoinette’s struggles clearly. I really liked Antoinette, even though her temper and her mouth would get away with her. She is so powerful and so used to fighting, of course it was hard to not always be on the defensive. Even with Moran, someone she thinks has her back.

The case moved slowly for me, which wasn’t a bad thing. French did a great job showing how everything almost added up, almost made sense, but there was always something missing, something hidden. Something the tagged. And the big reveal at the end was a good one. It was worth the wait.

This isn’t my most favorite of her books in the Dublin Murder Squad series, but I liked that it was different and unique. And that’s what I want in a mystery book."
"This is a great series with a uniquely different narrative in each book.

While I was reading The Trespasser, I watched a BBC Television Drama Series called The Fall starring Gillian Anderson. There were some similar chords shared between Trespasser and The Fall - I would recommend the show.

Some Favorite Passages from The Trespasser:

No one needs a relationship. What you need is the basic cop-on to figure that out, in the face of all the media bullshit screaming that you're nothing on your own and you're a dangerous freak if you disagree. The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all. And that doesn't just go for romance. I love my ma, I love my friends, I love the bones of them. If any of them wanted me to donate a kidney or crack a few heads, I'd do it, no questions asked. And if they all waved good-bye and walked out of my life tomorrow, I'd still be the same person I am today.
_______

Then I sit there, running the heat to try and thaw my feet after Lucy's flat, and watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for is chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.
_______

The wonder in his voice. He sounds like a teenager, lifting with joy and amazement, he sounds so tender you could bruise him with the wrong touch. Time after time it's left me gobsmacked , how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.
_______

I take one more look up at the rest of my life, waiting for me inside those neat sturdy squares of gold light."
"For some reason when I looked at a Tana French book I thought they were often about missing teenagers. Which of course would lead too just balls of angsty emotion just being hurled at me, and I am just not a fan of emotional lead fiction, I can never find a way into it.

Yeah, 'Trespasser' isn't it. It's a really decently plotted crime procedural that I am really surprised hasn't been adapted into a BBC series. Though what I really liked about this was how French revelled in it's procedurness, it's really just a series of police interviews and they are really great. French is able to make you squirm of cheer depending of how the plot is working.

But there is really interseting under current that is either a really low key view of domestic violence that you can take either way. It's the stories we tell ourselves, how we pretend to others, how we think we are viewed and what to me view verses the reality of the situation. French gives no opinion of domestic violence just asks questions and it can be uncomfortable. It does however make for one intersting lead character; who is bolshie unforgiving and paranoid as all hell. No one in this book is trust worthy not even Antoinette Conway. This makes the attomosphere claustraphobic and the sexism that more insidiousness.

Yes, this book is more bloated than I would have prefered, if it was a tight 300 pages it would have been absoultely magic. But because we live in an age where everything has to be world building and it cannot be under 400 pages there were a little to many incidental details or she sometimes came out and blurted out the subtext when she had built 400 pages with the subtext in mind. But at the end of the day those are nitpicks to a pretty successful crime novel. Seriously how is this not a BBC thing."
"Love Tana French and her dark, gloomy Dublin Murder Squad books. Her endings are always a little odd/dissatisfying, but this one was more redemptive than most. I was trying to explain why I loved her books so much to Sam, and it came down to the fact that it doesn't really matter who did it or whether anything is solved; it's really all about the process of getting there and its impact on everyone in the story. "
"Genuinely gripping read, with well-wrought characters and intriguing themes. Plus, for a police procedural, a tantalizing amount of nothing, things going wrong, leads and assumptions that go nowhere, entropy. It takes its time getting where it's going and that felt convincing and real."
"Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran (who she brought on board in the Dublin Murder Squad after working with him in a previous novel) are the newbies in the elite Irish police group, and as such, only receive humdrum domestic dispute assignments. Until one day the gaffer hands them what turns out to be a murder case of a pretty young woman. The case turns out to be anything but a simple lovers quarrel.

Antoinette, the only female on the squad, takes a lot of guff from other members (who want her anywhere else), and her resentment shows throughout the book. While she enjoys her work, she contemplates leaving for an offer in the private sector. Meanwhile, she has a murder to solve as her first lead detective case and goes about it diligently if somewhat misdirected by an experienced detective assigned to work with the partners for reasons not revealed until the end.

One criticism I made in the previous novel by Tana French was that it was tedious and slow reading. The same is true of “The Trespasser.” One has to plod through a couple of hundred pages of continual repetition before it all begins to make sense. And then, and only then, does the reading become enjoyable and worthwhile and the plot begin to come together. The novel would have been rated at a higher level had it not been for this criticism. Certainly, Ms French writes well and creates clever plots. One could wish she would now turn her attention to some judicious editing. That said, the novel is recommended.
"
"Antoinette Conway is leading an investigation that looks like a regular domestic killing along with her partner Steve Moran. A young woman has been found with her head bashed in. The house is in immaculate condition and the table is set for two.
This looks like an easy case but before they know it, however it soon evolves into a complex web of mystery. Lots of elements of the unknown, lots of possible suspects. At every point Antoinette faces other challenges like being the outsider in her own department. There are folk there who are just waiting for her to fail. Antoinette's feisty, in the face behaviour doesn't quite help.
A really well plotted story, with lots of detail. I could almost feel the setting, be it the crime scene or the roads they traipsed while investigating the murder. The characters were all well etched. Detective Conway, for all her aggression, tends to appeal with her down to earth nature and attitude to things. You cheer her on, you want her to emerge the winner.
I really enjoyed the way the story moves. It had me hooked almost as soon as I started reading and had me hooked till the very end. This is supposed to be part of a series but having read only this one, it was still easy enough for me to figure out the background. It did make me want to go and get hold of the other books in the series.
This author is one I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for."
"I am a HUGE fan of Tana French's work. I generally can't put her books down once I start so it was a huge surprise that I had to take regular breaks from this one. I'll explain: Antoinette was one of the prickliest characters I've encountered in some time. I understood why she acted the way she did and would probably be the same way myself in her shoes but as a reader, it was exhausting. French writes complex, gritty characters but this was the first time I found the main character to be unlikable. It may have felt like a departure for French and yet I couldn't stop thinking about Antoinette's character and the choice to depict her this way. She was convincing and she grew on me but yes, regular breaks were necessary.

The mystery itself was satisfying, though it lacked the usual punch (such as the endings of In The Woods and The Likeness, my favorites by French.) I loved Antoinette and Stephen's working relationship and how their understanding of each other grew over the course of the novel. I especially loved the depiction of workplace harassment/discrimination and Antoinette's specific challenges being the only female on the Murder Squad. I would love to see that topic explored more often in fiction. Overall, I thought this was a great addition to the Murder Squad series and wish it would be such a long wait until the next one."
"Good murder mystery with quite a few unexpected twists. I enjoyed it. 3.5 stars. My favorite Tana French book however is still ""Faithful Place.""

This book is centered around the character, Antoinette Conway, the lone female on the murder squad in her precinct. She suffers constant harassment as the only female officer with sexists jokes and references and some abusive anonymous bullying. Antoinette is constantly having to prove herself and act tougher than her peers to hopefully gain acceptance. She has lucked out with a partner that is easygoing and supportive the past two years, but they find they are only assigned the routine domestic violence cases and both long for a ""real"" case to prove their competence.

The book begins with Antoinette and her partner, Stephen, just completing an all night shift and finding they have been assigned a new - what initially appears to be routine - domestic violence death case. They are exhausted, but head over to begin the review. What makes our subject such a tough female character? Who can she trust on the squad? And, is the case an actual domestic violence case or something more complicated? When I thought I had it all figured out, the plot took a completely different turn.

Kept me reading. Good dialogue and no loose ends in the plot line. Did not disappoint."
"3.5 Stars

As with the other books in the Dublin Murder Squad series, the appeal of this new novel is the characters. French is skilled at writing complex, imperfect people who feel incredibly realistic and lifelike. The Trespasser focuses on a new female detective, Conway, who is struggling to fit into the murder squad. Conway is an unlikable character, which is not necessarily a criticism. I actually enjoy reading about characters who aren't particularly nice or agreeable. Instead, Conway is a snarky and judgmental woman with plenty of commentary about the people around her. Yet, she develops throughout the novel and becomes more likable as her character grows.

At times, the pacing of the story dragged a bit too much. I was, personally, more interested in murder mystery than the politics within the police station.My favourite aspects of the book involved the psychological profiling of the victim and other suspects. French is an insightful writer who understands the subtle aspects of people's behaviour.

Personally, In The Woods, The Likeness & Broken Harbour are my favourite of her novels. However, I still enjoyed this addition to her series and would recommend this ones to fans of Tana French's other books."
"It took me a while to get into this novel but once I reached a certain point, I couldn't stop reading.
The story has so many twists and turns, a person could almost get lost. I did find myself re-reading some parts, just to see that I had it right. A young woman is found murdered in her home and Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran get the case. They also get a more experienced murder detective to keep an eye on them. Conway is very sure that everyone on the murder squad wants her gone. She is very paranoid and every action seems to set off some kind of reaction from her. Moran, her partner, is a sweetie and tries to keep her from going off the rails. The two make a great pair, they bounce ideas and theories off of each other at every turn and although they seem to be far fetched, you can almost believe it happened the way they are thinking.
Once again, Tana French has written a very good police procedural and thrown in characters that you either love or hate. While I can't say I liked Antoinette very much, I did respect her and her desire to find the murderer. I was quite surprised at the ending and never once suspected who the murderer was. I love when that happens..."
"I love Tana French mostly because of her character analyses and because of the way her stories unfold! This book did not disappoint in those quarters!

I really, really enjoyed learning more about Antoinette Conway and her backstory in this book. At times, she can be a frustrating protagonist, with her self-destructive cynicism and possible paranoia. But I could empathize with her, even when I felt slightly perplexed by her behavior and thought process. Her relationship with Steven Moran was very touching and reading about their interactions made me like her even more! Yay, great coworkers! ☺️

The mystery/crime itself isn't anything that earth-shatteringly unique. One can argue that it is even a little cliched! However, I really liked the way it is written. Very few authors seem to do the slow burn as well as Ms. French. I loved the pacing and build up in the book. The central players are interesting, sympathetic, and relatable.

Overall, definitely an excellent read for people who love psychology thrillers!

"Don't let the fact that this is the sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series keep you from reading it. Each of the books also works as a stand alone, they are all very good and this one is certainly no exception.

You can read a summary of the book many places, and the story is a good one. The one thing I can offer is the suggestion that you make sure you have big chunks of time to spend reading it. The way the detectives go about solving what seems to others like a simple case changes so much along the way that reading it in bits and pieces would not do it justice. Plus it's 449 pages so if your memory is like mine, you'll forget some of the details if too much real life intervenes.

I don't know if all the doubts and constantly changing theories represent what being a police detective is really like, but French makes it feel so true and realistic that I felt I was right there with the main characters all the way. French is one of those authors whose books I buy without even reading the summaries and I've never been disappointed. Now if she could just write faster!"
"Tana French is a wonderful police writer. Each story focuses on one police officer so that you see how the personality of the officer figures into the case. So that's a plus for readers who like police procedural. The setting of Dublin allows French to give us the wonderful Irish dialect and phrases, yeah? I loved reading the dialogue because of this.
Then there is the story: Antoinette Conway, the first female detective in the Murder Squad, doesn't feel like she's accepted by the other Ds. She and her partner (one of my favorite characters in the book and might be the focus of the next book) are always dealing with domestic murder cases. This new one looks like that is what it is, but looks are deceiving especially when there is a cover-up involved. Conway comes with the usual complicated backstory that all of French's characters have that influence how she views the victim and the other police.

Exercise analogy: fast paced, possible tennis match."
"My only quibble with this book is that sometimes I felt that the author spent a bit too much time inside the main character's head. Antoinette Conway is a complex and intense person with a huge chip on her shoulder who often takes things too far. Her partner, Steve Moran, is the perfect foil for her caustic personality but when she begins to distrust him as well as everyone else on the squad, it's almost too much. She seems out of control.

Fortunately, her cop instinct gains the upper hand and it's pure pleasure witnessing just how smart and tough she really Is.

All of Tana French's books have a deep psychological vibe to them, but this may be the one that uses that the most: we see the innermost workings of the minds of at least three of the main characters and it's pretty heavy stuff."
"Vlastně se to nečte špatně, i vcelku odsýpá, je to slušně napsáno, není nezajímavé podívat se na vyšetřovací metody, přičemž důraz je tu kladen především na vedení výslechů. Ale to je asi tak všechno. Tana French už u mě žádnou další knížkou nedosáhla toho nadšení, jaké jsem měla při čtení V Lesích. I tak mě v jejích knihách bavilo hlavně to, jak uměla vykreslit charaktery a rozehrávat s nimi skvělé hry. Často ve mně vzbuzovala různorodé, ale obvykle docela silné emoce. Většinou minimálně několik postav mě opravdu zajímalo. Ve Vetřelci ne. Všichni mi byli v podstatě jedno, vůbec jsem neměla problém se s nimi na posledních stranách rozloučit. Přišli mi stejně anonymní, jako bych si pročítala zápisy z reálných výslechů neznámých policistů. A celou dobu jsem čekala na nějaký zásadní zvrat a ono nic. Škoda."
"What a great book! A typical Tana French's crime book that is less a crime and much more psychological drama. The whole story is really fantastic, very interesting, convincing with actual and current problems that we all face every day in our work lives. Especially women surrounded with older and perhaps more experienced men who believe that they know it all and no younger woman or lad can ever never do the good job as themselves. Oh poor Conway, nobody would like to be in her place.
The book and the story deserves at least 5*, but it is a bit slow and in some places too long (endless but interesting and absolutely necessary) conversations.
Loved the ending.
Hopefully Tana French is writing a new book for her loyal reading audience."
"I think by this point, anyone who reads a Dublin Murder Squad book knows what they are getting. This is exactly to Tana French's formula of a detective investigating a murder in which the investigation extends dangerous tendrils into the detective's own life, and because the detective is the (idiosyncratic, interesting) narrator, the meta-story is more compelling than the whodunit the book is ostensibly about. Antoinette is a mixed-race woman in the white man's club of the Murder Squad, and her defensive perspective magnifies every slight into an outrage and gives every event ominous overtones. Her unreliable narration makes for an interesting ride, with (as usual) a tangled and bittersweet, though satisfying, ending."
"The last 1/3 of this book is really well done, but it takes a really long time getting there. I would describe all of French's novels as slow burns, but this one was super slow. I think it felt especially that way since Antoinette Conway is not as I would describe as ""a likable character"". So it is kind of a drag to be stuck in her head with very little action while the story is developing. I would have been more turned off if I were not already such a fan of French's writing and I knew the book would pull through (which it did). First part of the book was 2 stars and the ending was 5 stars. And, French automatically gets a little bump up in the rating from me, so that will all round out to 4 stars. "
" A Washington Post reviewer recently wrote that ""U.S.-born, Dublin-based Tana French is the most interesting, most important crime novelist to emerge in the past 10 years."" Damn. While I enjoyed this much-praised novel, my God was it ever Irish - to the point that it was difficult for me to follow. Still, it was a juicy story with an uncommonly detailed look at the behind-the-scenes goings-on of a squad of murder detectives, told from the perspective of talented but surly Antoinette Conway, the lone woman & POC in the department. Enjoyable but overall fairly depressing, with a dissatisfying ending. "
"4.5 stars

This is told from the point of view of a female detective. Someone was murdered. She and her partner have to figure out what really happened, and they are under tremendous pressure to wrap it up quickly. Great mystery. Excellent delivery. The character feel real. I got into the story right away and it kept me interested. I didn't know how the story would end before it happened. That's a plus for sure. This is listed as book 6 in the series. I don't know how much the books are connected because this is the only one that I've read, but I did not feel lost at all. I recommend it."
"Well that's all of 'em. I read all of the Tana French books and now there are no more. After a few slightly weaker outings, this one was a return to form, mostly owing to the well-written main character. Antoinette Conway is a great character, a tough, prickly, woman of color fighting for respect in the stodgiest of old boys clubs. The plot doesn't approach the bizarre heights of her first two books, and borrows a few too many elements from Broken Harbor, but the theme of 
police coverup of a murder is a strong one.
"
"I've read all of French's books and although I don't always like her characters, she does a great job of making them come alive with all the nuances of human nature. I also enjoy that she focuses on one or two characters in each book, tells their story, then moves onto another player in the fictitious Murder Squad of Dublin, Ireland. I will continue to read her series and I hope she keeps developing different detectives' personal stories. I like that she wraps up the present story, ""kind of"" and leaves you with enough unanswered questions that you think about her book for a while after completing it. "
"Tana French is the master of making her characters feel like real people and, just as importantly, making the setting of the book feel real. This book could not take place anywhere other than Dublin and with anyone other than Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway. Conway is an especially fascinating character when we switch from seeing her through Moran's POV in the previous book to her own POV in this book. She's insecure but cocky, paranoid but self-assured, tough but vulnerable. The whodunnit, as usual, is not the point of this book. This is first and foremost a book about a woman healing from severe trust and intimacy issues. Tana French you have fucking done it again!"
"I would like to thank Edelweiss, Penguin Random House Publishing, and Tana French for the advanced digital copy in exchange for an honest review. This is my first go round with Tana French and I am quite impressed with the story, the lay out, the plot, the characters, and her knowledge of police procedure. It took me 8 days to read this book because there is so much chatter and dialog that was all so relevant to the plot, I needed to absorb every word. The only criticism I have is the victim's story is somewhat pathetic and winded. Regardless, I will definitely get to her other novels. "
"Expertly crafted murder mystery with believable characters, great setting and taut plot. I was immediately drawn into the mood and attitude of the main character and she is unforgettable. She is not always likeable, and frequently annoying, but I never doubted her commitment to the victim and the right solution. That alone made her a pariah on her squad. This is a long book but worth every page-turning moment. I received my copy from Penguin's First to Read Program and felt pretty lucky about it."
"I don't think the plot is quite up to Tana French's skills as a writer this time, but then, that's a super high bar to cross. I liked this less than I like my Tana French favorites, but more than I liked my Tana French least-favorites. And my least favorites of hers are akin to Mexican food; even the not-so-good stuff is still pretty good. It was a pretty interesting twist on the ""unreliable narrator"" too...she's not completely unreliable, and I thought she threaded the needle of making Conway both a victim and slightly paranoid pretty deftly."
"This book is mostly talking. There's some police procedural stuff, but mostly, it's talking. Cops talking to cops, cops to witnesses. Lot of talking. And because it's Tana French, this book is brilliant. Tense and edgy, taught with suspense. A who-dunit with a rather pedestrian crime is, in French's hands, better than almost any other contemporary crime thriller. It's about stories - the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we tell others. And it's riveting. "
"There were parts of this book where my interest kind of waned but, in the end, I really enjoyed it. This main character, Antoinette Conway, is intricately written and interesting, and the case is intriguing enough. If not for the resolution and the twists that we too to get there, I enjoyed the interactions between Conway and Moran. These two were really fun together and I thought that their relationship was really strong both on a work and personal level. "
"Another enjoyable installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I found this story to be a slow burn and at times wished that it moved at a faster pace. I thought the ending was satisfying, though, so that made it worth it for me. Highly recommend.

Thanks to Netgalley for an advanced digital review copy of this book."
"It's great to find a crime writer who doesn't write the same book over and over again. And French definitely explores variations in the British detective novel. This book is just as much about the psychological character of Detective of Antoinette Conway as it is about finding the murderer of Aislinn Murray. So if you find detective fiction a bit repetitive, give French a try."
"Perhaps Tana French's best novel yet. French does a great job of inhabiting an unlikeable character and making the reader really care what happens to her. And the ending gave me chills -- I read it over and over, just for the pleasure of reading some first-rate writing. I might go read it again now."
"This book was predictable and not in a bad way. It was predictably good as have been all of the others. There has not been a Book by French that I haven't really enjoyed and read with anticipation of a great mystery.

Great suspense and great story line. As always I guess I should say again. Thank you Tana French for the true talent that you share with the world."
"This is book 6 in her Dublin Murder Squad series. She explores ideas of obsession and paranoia in this story, and I must say, the paranoia of the main character almost made me crazy. This book is also missing the lyrical weirdness of some of her other stories. However, the mystery was tightly woven (as always -- she's a master) and the ending was quite satisfactory. "
"This isn't always the best type of book for me, I don't like it when the good guys seem to get the shaft and get wrongly accused of things. But this addition to the murder squad series is a good one. The mystery is intriguing, but the way things play out is actually more interesting than the actual results of the case. French is a star at police procedurals."
"Another Tana French winner. Loved how Conway's character was drawn - her tough-as-nails approach to detective work, her IDGAF attitude regarding her father, and even how her judgment was often clouded by (unwarranted?) paranoia. The twists and turns of the case - whether real or manufactured - cleverly obfuscated the solve and kept me hooked. "
"Tana French continues to astound. This book is about a crime, but it's also more fundamentally about narratives -- the stories that we tell to ourselves and other people to make sense of our lives, and how those stories can spin out of control. Read while traveling to/from Lansing MI for ACAL and at home on a day of rest before Easter Break."
"This is a skillfully told story, with multi-dimensional characters. Not one character is all good or all bad. Faults are exposed as are strengths. The actual crime is almost secondary to the great character development."
"""No one needs a relationship. What you need is the basic cop-on to figure that out, in the face of all the media bullshit screaming that you're nothing on your own and you're a dangerous freak if you disagree. The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all."""
"I agree with most reviewers - Tana French hasn't written a book I didn't like yet. Her writing is so good that she could write about almost anything and keep my interest. If you haven't tried her books yet, you will hooked after a few pages. "
"Another stellar Tana French. Read this one with a note card as my bookmark and recorded my theories as I had them and what page. Figured it out (with some doubts/questions) early on, but that's one of the things I love about her books. It's all logical. And it's fun to play along."
"Literally I would die for Tana French... Every one of her books is just consistently so good, reliably well written and beautifully crafted and with such well-rounded, wonderfully drawn, complex and broken and human detectives. "
"My favorite in the series is still ""The Likeness"" but this one was, of course, great as well."
"I really love Tana French. This one didn't suck me in quite as hard as some of hers do, but it was still a great book. "
I might need to read all of these Murder Squad books. Tana French can write like a house afire. 
Duplicate listing. See my review on other book listing. 
"I love Tana French and will continue to read everything she writes. Mysteries are not usually my jam, but her gorgeous writing and page turning but not too gory mysteries suck me in every time. "
OH. 
"I loved the imperfections of Antoinette Conway. She felt so real, like an old friend. Nearly 5 stars!! "
"I would do 3.5 to 4 on this one. A little slow in parts, but once it picked up I couldn't put it down! I love the protagonist and was rooting for her the whole book. "
"Twisty story with naive, good and bad characters ... all you need in crime book. Definitely my favorite book from Dublin Murder Squad series - just because Antoinette Conway is badass."
Always entertaining
"This was a bit slow to get started, then it raced to the end. I liked the ending a lot - it was satisfying."
I love Tana French's books. The Tresspasser is a slow burn that is almost entirely about murder interrogation psychology.
"​""Gefrorener Schrei"" ist ein typischer Tana French Krimi. Er konzentriert sich auf die Ermittler. Ihre Motivationen, ihre Gefühle stehen im Mittelpunkt. Hier ist Antoinette Conway die Ermittlerin. Sie lernten wir schon kurz in vorangegangen Buch ""Geheimer Ort"" kennen.


Antoinette ist eine sehr eigenwillige Figur. Meistens ist sie schlecht gelaunt und sieht alles negativ. Sie hat es schwer im Morddezernat. Ihr werden üble Streiche gespielt, die schon deutlich an Mobbing grenzen. Deswegen wittert sie auch überall eine Verschwörung gegen sich. Sie hinterfragt im laufe des Buches jede Person in ihrem Umfeld und dichtet ihnen üble Absichten an. Überhaupt ist Antoinette in meinen Augen etwas paranoid und sehr selbstbezogen. Das macht sie zu keiner einfachen Figur.


Die Handlung ist im Grunde nicht sehr verwickelt. Eigentlich passiert auch nicht viel. Antoinette und ihr Partner Steve versuchen, den Mord an der jungen Aislinn Murray aufzuklären. Es sieht zu Anfang aus wie ein einfacher aus dem Ruder gelaufener Beziehungsstreit. Aber die beiden verrennen sich schon bald in ausufernde Theorien, wie es auch gewesen sein könnte. Sie entwickeln Szenarien, kauen die gemeinsam durch und verwerfen sie wieder. Dadurch wird irgendwie die ganze Zeit geredet in diesem Buch. Ich weiss nicht, ob ich schon mal ein derart dialoglastiges Buch gelesen habe. Das ist jetzt kein Kritikpunkt. Denn die Dialoge sind wirklich gut geschrieben. Aber dadurch passiert auch nicht viel. Es spielt sich viel in den Köpfen der Figuren ab. Wobei wir ja nur bei Antoinette sind und ihre Gedanken lesen. Aber genau darum geht es. Die Vorstellungskraft der Figuren, wie sie Geschehnisse wahrnehmen und einordnen für sich sind ein zentraler Punkt in dieser Geschichte.


​""Zahllose Leute gehen vorbei, es nimmt kein Ende, und jeder Einzelne von ihnen hat den Kopf voller Geschichten, die er glaubt, und Geschichten, die er glauben möchte, und Geschichten, die ihm jemand anders eingeimpft hat, und jede Geschichte hämmert ihm gegen die dünnen Schädelwände, bohrt und nagt, um endlich herauszukommen und jemand anderszu attakieren, sich in ihn hineinzugraben und von dessen Verstand Besitz zu ergreifen."" (S. 540)​


Antoinette hat zuerst wenig Mitgefühl für das Mordopfer. Auch der vermeintliche Täter ist in ihren Augen ein Schwächling. Sie dreht sich mehr und mehr im Kreis und merkt nicht, das sie Dinge, die genau vor ihrer Nase sind, selber nicht sehen will. Auch sie lebt in ihrer eigenen, subjektiv wahrgenommenen Welt.


Nachdem ich ""Geheimer Ort"" nicht ganz so gut fand ob der abgedrehten Story und Frenchs etwas selbstverliebtem ausufernden Schreibstils, bin ich froh, das sie hier wieder zu alter Form zurückgefunden hat. Die erste Hälfte des Buches habe ich locker weggelesen , über Antoinettes ruppige Art geschmunzelt und mich an Frenchs Schreibstil erfreut. In der Mitte hängt das Buch etwas durch. Das Buch ist gewohnt umfangreich, aber hier es ist einen tick zu lang. In der Mitte wurde es mir dann doch etwas zu viel mit dem vielen im Kreis ermitteln, gegen Wände laufen und dummen Ideen nachjagen. Antoinette kommt an einem Punkt, an dem sie wirklich jede Person hinterfragt und immer einen zweite Interpretation ihres Eindrucks durchgeht. Das grenzt schon sehr an Paranoia und machte sie in meinen Augen auch etwas betriebsblind.


Die Story ist düster und über weite Teile auch spannend. Es gibt viel Polizeiarbeit. Tana French ist eine Meisterin der Dialoge. Das zeigt sich vor allem in den Vernehmungsszenen. Diese Stellen sind faszinierend und extrem gut geschrieben. Das Buch ist, ebenso typisch für French, eher langsam und auch etwas ausufernd und defitiv kein Pageturner. Aber auf jeden Fall lohnenswert, trotz der Überlänge."
"The Trespasser is currently the last book of Dublin Murder Squad. This has been a series that mixed character study of the detective involved in the case as well as a police procedural. Whilst I liked many elements in this novel, I don't think it was her best. I have a ranking which I will give at the end, but I am yet to read book 2. (So this will be edited next month when I read that one).

In this installment, we follow Antoinette Conway. If there is one thing Tana French does well, it is the unlike-able but realistic character. And this is no exception. It is not easy being in Conway's head space. She is constantly angry and seems to be extra-paranoid. It is no surprise that female detectives have a high standard to reach to measure when facing the old boy's club. Add to this that Conway is mixed race and that her father was absent in her childhood, the psychological turmoil can be volatile. Despite her prickly, abrasive nature I was rooting for her. Especially as I felt that the banter between her and her partner Moran was one of the healthiest portrayal I saw so far.

The case mirrors Conway to an extent but it felt messy with the theories/red herrings that were pursued. At the end of the night shift, Conway and Moran are given a supposedly routine domestic case by their supervisor. It seems to be a lover's tiff and there is an implicit desire to quickly solve this case. But this case proves to be anything but routine.

By the time you read the startling conclusion to this installment you will need time to process all that was accomplished here. It continued to cement my decision to read more works by this author, except The Witch Elm because she understands and portrays people so well. Especially unlikeable characters.

Ranking of the Dublin Murder Squad

"Pride and Paranoia in the Dublin Murder Squad.
The author of this Irish cop series invents interesting people. I am not always equally impressed by her plots. The solutions to her problems are sometimes not convincing. That makes me lose stamina near the end of her novels. The Trespasser has the same basic problem. It kept my interest for most of the story by its gripping psychological depictions of group dynamics in a police squad, and by its thorough procedural approach. What do we know, what does it mean, what do we need to do next - that’s a good approach if you tell a murder investigation story from a first person perspective.

That narrator is the lead detective on the case. She is a young, ethnically mixed woman (specifics are withheld, other than ‘brown’ nothing is disclosed) with a difficult personality. She struggles for her standing in the squad. She might be a little paranoid, but maybe most colleagues really are trying to make life harder for her, the only woman in the outfit. Luckily her immediate partner seems ok. Or is there a hidden agenda? And maybe not all her perceived enemies have it in for her? Maybe not everyone who dislikes her style is dirty?

The case: a single woman has died violently in her small house in the Stoneybatter area of Dublin. The current boyfriend is the obvious first suspect. But is the answer really that easy? Of course not. There are complications. The narrator resists the quick and easy answers and we get stuck in a morass of cluelessness and emotions. Once the answers roll in, we somehow don't quite feel pleased, neither rationally nor emotionally. The victim’s personality is overstretched. The book is 100 pages too long. It seems I keep saying that."
"Tana French writes so well, with an acute awareness of the subtle variations in the field as the gritty story plays out in all its complexity. ""The air twitches, in the corners"" as our hero investigates a crime, the many possible permutations of bent cops on her team, and her own insights and miscues.

As in Faithful Place, the narrator has a powerful macho-sounding cop voice - but this time from a female protagonist of colour and with a particularly sharp exploration of both the deep prejudice she experiences, and the ways her understandable defensiveness can misdirect her reading of the situation. And just because she is tough, it doesn't mean she is immune:

""They tested me, my first weeks on the squad, the same way a predator tests a potential victim in a bar: tossing out small stuff – worn- out jokes starting Why is a woman like a, comments about me being on the rag, hints about how I had to be pretty good at whatever I’d done to get this gig – to see if I’d force myself to laugh along. Checking, just like the predator checks, for the well- behaved one who’ll take the putdowns and the humiliation sooner than God forbid make a fuss; who can be forced, shove by shove, into doing whatever.""


As the story unfolds, she realises that the tensions and internal warfare in the Dublin murder squad are less about her than she thought. It becomes a fascinating exploration of the nature of human projections:

""Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.""


In the end the book champions the struggle to be independent, to live one's own life in spite of all the direct challenges and more subtle prejudices. And some of the most insidious challenges are what she calls ""owning people"" particularly by withholding information. She is explicit about what happens if one person decides what another shouldn't know: ""Everything she ever did after you walked in her door, every thought that ever went through her head, it had your fingerprints all over it. And you knew it would."""
"My first foray with this author, and what a pleasure! The Trespasser is a very entertaining novel involving the murder detectives in Dublin, and in particular, a female protagonist (Antoinette Conway) who carries a Redwood-sized chip on her shoulder due to the hazing and disrespect she endures from the otherwise all-male murder squad.
Ms. French has written a complex story with a singular theme, but contained within that theme are enough twists and switchbacks to qualify as an F-1 racetrack. And therein lies the problem-- for me at least. This would have been a 5 star story had it been 100 pages briefer, or contained at least one additional murder case for the detectives to solve. I just felt that too much time was spent going back and forth between two main possible solutions to the murder under investigation. French does a stellar job instilling just enough plausibility in each potential pathway, that this reader found himself uncertain as to what to believe more than once. Cool!
The interactions between Conway and her partner (both newbies to the murder squad) are delightful and full of wit, sarcasm (a specialty of Conway's), and a begrudging growth of true bonding, especially at the end.
The use of language indigenous to Ireland sometimes slowed me down, but never prevented any comprehension-- in fact, it adds to the book's ability to take you completely into it's world and any reader might close the book and seek out a local pub for a ""pint"" wish his/her mates when finished. Of course, if you actually live in the UK, this might be a moot point, but from my seat, it was delightfully different.
Overall, I'm pleased to have discovered this author and look forward to reading more of her work soon. Just going to nip off now for a pint o' the plain!"
"I like a good murder mystery as much as anyone, but they start to feel a little formulaic and predictable after a while, don't they? That's why The Trespasser is such a success -- while it takes a murder as its central plotline, French uses that backdrop to transcend the typical whodunnit genre and instead create a truly masterful character study of the lead detective on the case, who just happens to be a bi-racial woman trapped in a boys' club in a fairly conservative city.

I don't think I've ever felt more ""inside someone's head"" in a murder mystery as I did throughout this book, which is written in the first person from the very human perspective of lead detective Antoinette Conway. Conway is a flawed person, like we all are, and her character flaws are allowed to reveal themselves naturally throughout the story. But she is also an extremely compelling character and one that you actively root for, even when she's acting a little petulant or paranoid or engaging in self-delusions that a reader can spot as unhealthy from a mile away. Her complicated relationship with her partner Steve and her squad in general becomes the true plot of this story, even as she works tirelessly to solve a young woman's murder.

All in all, good pacing, realistic dialogue, fully developed characters (down to even the supporting cast) and a fully-rendered setting that makes you feel as though you've dropped down in the middle of a murder investigation in Dublin. If you're looking for a murder mystery that skews more literary fiction, I highly recommend this one."
"This book presented itself to me before The Secret Place so I went ahead and read it, knowing I would miss out on a key character's backstory and that l have to go back to fill in the gap. It didn't matter to understanding the characters or the story, though, and I'm far enough into the series to recognize many of the background characters as well.

I was a bit concerned that I was no longer a fan of Tana French's as this was a very slow to start story for me. I quite disliked Antoinette; she's the kind of person that I would go to great lengths to avoid in person. Just at the point that I was fed up with her, and thinking of quitting the book, the pieces started flowing together and I was captivated. I stayed up way too late to read the last 200 pages or so in one fell swoop.

As with all of French's books, the plot is secondary to the characters. So, if you're looking for a fast-paced thriller, this is not it. There's a great deal of meandering and introspection, and I could see that being unsatisfying for many; it's lyrical and can be a bit repetitive. However, her touch with dialogue kept me engaged and I found the tension building, almost in spite of myself. I already know who I want to head the next in the series, so I hope she is writing it now."
"The modern queen of crime strikes again - and, as always, hits the target just so.

Marking this reading experience 4 out of 5 stars requires a bit of an explanation then, and this explanation is very simple. One of the things Tana French is so good at is creating remarkable, vivid and unique settings for her novels - woods neighboring housing estate, old mansion becoming a fortress for a reclusive group of students, boarding school... Their exquisite imagery is something I am looking forward to in every Dublin Murder Squad book, and The Trespasser just doesn't have it, focusing on the plot and the battleground that is the mind of Antionette Conway.

Detective Conway is an unreliable narrator impeccably done. She has so much anger and suspicion that the world is closing in on her, and we are along for the ride because the pull of Antoinette's personality is too strong, because the emotional portrayal done by the author is just right, and because there is solid ground this paranoia is rooted in. Conway's fears - as well as expectations of Detective Moran who is always a welcome sight - play out within the walls of the station, within the murder squad that is anything but a monolith.

The writing, the well-shaped characters with distinct personalities, the slow burning tension, the many transformations of Aislinn Murray who keeps reinventing herself even from the grave - it's such a great read."
"Husband and I listened to this book as an audio book. I don't think we'd have made it otherwise. It is very long, drawn out, and replete with extraneous detail: ""he crumpled up the paper and tossed it in the bin..."" Every breath, every movement is recorded. From reading the reviews, I guess most people like that style. I find it very tedious to read, but in the oral form, it was okay to listen to, especially because the narrator was so excellent. I loved the Irish accent, the expressions and her ability to portray all the characters differently. I listened to all the discs, sometimes nodding off or losing track of where I was. Hubby listened to the first three, then caught up for the last two. He didn't feel he'd missed anything. That says something.

However....the writing is amazing. French has an ability to capture the inner workings of the mind like few writers I've ever experienced. I'll always understand and never forget now, why men cheat on their wives with a younger woman. It was so beautifully expressed, you felt sorry for the cheater. But it made perfect sense. In the end, you feel you know these people, and you miss them when the book is over. They all live between the covers of that CD package: 18 discs! So I don't regret the time invested. I doubt I will read another one though. It's not my cup of tea, but what an accomplishment as a writer."
"I've often suspected that whether a book review shows that the reader enjoyed the book or disdained it was dependent on the state of mind of the reviewer. I've read reviews of really excellent books (my assessment) where the reviewer claimed the book was flat, confusing, a complete boor. I've also hated books that others found fascinating, delightful - and in those cases I sometimes admit that my judgement was clouded by 1) reading while highly distracted or 2) reading while very tired or 3) the topic hit too close to home.The best review on this book is by Jessica https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1... - My problem is that while I love the grittiness of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books, I was reading 
  The Trespasser
 during the pandemic-2020 election - vaccine and mask ""crisis."" I don't have a lot of patience these days. Usually I relish a difficult person when I'm reading fiction, but I just felt overwhelmed by Detective Conway's rabbit holes of paranoia. Ironically Conway felt frustration similar to mine for her partner going off on ""what if"" tangents. But as Jessica said in her review, the audio book is great, the mystery is satisfying, and the details are all carefully planned. My only lack of joy in reading 
  The Trespasser 
 was that I need to read happier stories right now!"
"hot dog!!! this book has sent me down a path to read everything else in french’s arsenal. she writes suspense and little pieces coming together exceptionally well, and expertly paces each clue and new revelation. i was completely immersed all of the steadily ramping up personal and professional dramas and the theme of fantasy/delusions that shield us from realities we’re not ready to handle.

i don’t think the twist went off quite without a hitch, but i think it was a hard transition to make. that’s why this book isn’t 5 stars all the way. i love the characters and the writing and the plot and i’m all geared up to dive into the rest of french’s body of work, but i think she ended up unintentionally shifting from higher tension to lower tension, which necessarily means there’ll be some sense of deescalation. i’m sure it’ll feel completely natural to a number of readers, but just for me i had a few moments where i paused and had to repeat passages to make sure i was following.

other than that this book, and tana french in general, have sparkling endorsements from me if you’re into the complex character driven murder mystery. and i’d HIGHLY recommend the audiobook version just for the benefit of the accents and all their little nuances."
"The Trespasser is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. The books can all be read independently as there are only a few reappearing characters across the series. While still better than many modern day mysteries, The Trespasser fell short of Tana French's prior books, in particular, ""The Likeness.""

The Trespasser is well-written, well-paced, and captivating. Tana French transports you into the gritty world of working a murder case in Dublin alongside a very realistic and uniquely flawed cast of characters, from Steve who ""looks like his mammy spit-shined him for Mass"" to Breslin, who Antoinette (our narrator) wants to punch ""in both his faces."" Antoinette Conway is not my usual heroine - she's gutsy, crass, hard-headed, and hard-hearted and (too often) veers into an almost paranoid masochism. She's fiercely independent and stubborn, which usually is off-putting to me, but it fits. In a female-narrated mystery (about a woman murdered in her home during a romantic dinner), Conway's perspective was actually refreshing. While trolling on a dating site, she thinks ""all those idiots on the websites, begging for other people to pull their sagging puppet-strings, turn them real: they make me want to spit."" Her independence isn't romanticized - she is nearly incapable of trusting others or asking for help. When someone is watching her home, she thinks, ""If someone rescues you, they own you. Not because you owe them - you can sort that, with enough good favors or bottles of booze dressed up in ribbons. They own you because you're not the lead in your own story any more."" While Conway is definitely remote, this tracks with her personality and her actions throughout the novel. She isn't likeable per say, but she is admirable, in her own right. The paranoia that gradually overtakes Conway's personality, though well-written (and necessary to progress the plot), just doesn't fit.


Conway jumps back and forth between the lure of working for the murder squad (""Murder isn't like other squads. When it's working right, it would take your breath away: it's precision-cut and savage, lithe and momentous, it's a big cat leaping full-stretch or a beauty of a rifle so smooth it practically fires itself…That's the nearest I've ever been to falling in love"" to truly despicable 'locker room talk' (Trump-style), harassment, and criminal behavior of her colleagues. While some of the detailed behavior would be believable, when it got to the point that detectives were stealing evidence to make her life harder, spreading truly vicious sexual rumors, and were sacrificing the viability of solving a murder case, both the behavior and the main character's reluctant accepting (though definitely pissed-off) attitude were just 'off.' I think that the author included these sections so that suspect behavior amongst the squad would be believable (which it was), but it just didn't fit. It seemed out of place and Conway's paranoia moved from over-reaction to truly jarring:

""Everyone I think of feels slippery and double, a picture flickering faster than my eyes can focus.""
""Breslin and McCann pulled all their crap specifically, deliberately to fuck me up.""
""I can't tell if this is batshit paranoia or the bleeding obvious slapping me in the face.""
""I'm gonna assume anyone on this squad is the enemy, unless I've got stone-cold proof that he's not.""

The second issue I had with The Trespasser is Aislinn's motivation. I think Conway summed it up when she thought ""part of me is actually growing some respect for Aislinn Murray. The core idea is idiotic shite, but the way she went about it: fair play to her."" Aislinn's dad abandoned her and her mother when she was a child. Detective Joe Conway was assigned to the case. When he found the missing dad, happily living with his new girlfriend, he ""made them extras in his hero cop story"" and decided it would be best not to tell them anything, which Conway relates as ensuring that, for Evelyn and Aislinn ""every day was what [Joe had] made it into"". Aislinn, as an adult, finds out this and believes that when someone says ""let me take a chunk of your life and re-write it my way - that never comes out of the goodness of anyone's heart"" and she decides to make him pay by making him fall in love with her, leave his wife and kids, and then she plans to dump him. See ""idiotic shit"" above.

The feeling that the paranoia and detectives' behavior just wasn't quite right kept jarring me out of the story and back into reality. Aislinn's pathetic obsession with her dad's disappearance and her idiotic plan (and follow-through) to get back at a guy who may have really thought he was doing what was best was also an eye-roll during an otherwise critical moment in the novel. Honestly, this should be a 3 star review (based on the characterization and the plot), but throughout the novel, Tana French reminds you of the power of stories (see bolded parts above). In the reveal at the end of the novel, Conway notes that everyone is ""frantically spinning stories to the keep the world the way they want it"" and that ""time after time it's left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads."" And lastly, when we're left with a possible ambiguous confession, we're reminded that while Antoinette and Steve were ""scrabbling so hard to pull the true story out of the tangle, we forgot the false ones come with their own ferocious, double-edged power."" While this reflection on power of stories, whether true or not, doesn't correct the characterization or plot issues, for me, it made this a much more worthwhile read.

For someone looking to start reading Tana French, I'd recommend starting with Book 1 of the series (which is good) or with Book 2: ""The Likeness"", which is fantastic (though it does require you to relinquish disbelief and enjoy the ride). This book was still an enjoyable weekend read, but it was not her best work."
"I don't read enough murder mysteries. This one was set in Dublin, which is apparently where most of French's books are set. I want to comment on one aspect of the story, which is a spoiler, though not for the main mystery. 
One officer on the squad is diligently and nastily harassing the protagonist. None of the other officers are publicly standing up for her. This gives her the impression that no one on the squad likes her or thinks well of her, and makes her hate all her coworkers and fear that even her partner isn't going to back her up when she needs it. There are other aspects of her work environment that also exemplify the idea of one bad apple spoiling the barrel. Because she thinks her commanding officer is a decent person, she decides to let go of her resentment and stay on the squad. I think this part is the unrealistic part. If your boss lets that one guy harass you, and all your coworkers go along with it, you're right to be pissed and want to leave the job."
"I loved the narrator's constant over-analysis of everything. All French's narrators are like this, but in this case it really worked. The mystery is less important than the drama within the police squad.

> I’m amazed this guy manages to get out of bed in the morning without working himself into a panic attack over the chance that he might trip on the bath mat and stab himself through the eye socket with his toothbrush and be left with a permanent twitch that’ll ruin his chances of landing an airplane safely if the pilot has a heart attack and doom hundreds to a fiery death.

> Lucy lights another smoke. I love nicotine. It puts witnesses back in their comfort zone when things get tricky, it keeps the vic’s friends and family from going to pieces, it means we can make suspects as antsy as we want and then throw them an instant chill pill when we want them calm again. Non-smokers are double the hassle; you have to find other ways to adjust their dials. If it was my call, everyone involved in murders would be on a pack a day"
"Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran are the newest murder squad detectives, and up until now have been getting only bog standard DV cases. When a young woman’s dead body is found in her living room all the clues point to it being another lover’s tiff gone wrong. But Antoinette and Steve aren’t 100% sure that everything is as it seems to be, and dig around to see what they can find out...

Tana French is such a brilliant writer. She hooks you in from the get go, and there is no way you can let go of The Trespasser until you have figured out the case alongside the main characters. I love how she develops her characters, how solid and human they are, and how she develops the plot, peeling off layer after layer, never missing a beat.

I also really love the descriptions of Dublin, of people, of atmospheres in her books. It’s impossible not to feel right there. I love a good crime story I can really get my teeth into, and The Trespasser does that - Tana French throws you a few bones here and there, but there is no way you can figure out the mystery until the detectives do - and it’s brilliant!
"
"My first Tana French book and it was a good time! I honestly cannot believe that I had never heard of French before my dad (shoutout to Mark) became absolutely obsessed. Thanks to his dedication we now own all of her books and I will definitely be picking up more in the future!
It's been a while since I read a proper mystery novel as opposed to just a thriller, and I have to say I really enjoyed returning to my Nancy Drew roots. This definitely felt like more of a slow burn, but I really appreciated the little clues woven throughout and how everything ended up making sense in the end. It was less focused on shock value than, say, The Silent Patient, but it was still a really fun story that kept me guessing. I appreciated how long we got to spend with the characters; they began to feel incredibly real. There were definitely a couple things that felt slightly unrealistic but hey! It's fiction. Good on ye Tana."
"Wow. Ok. So, I love Tana French. I genuinely think she might be one of my favorite authors, but my one problem with her is all the other books I read by her seemed to always leave loose threads. I’ve never wanted to actually email/write a letter to an author before to ask them to explain something to me, but that was another book. Even though I felt there were loose ends, the books were still incredible and they sucked me in and I would read them in a day. This book isn’t like that. The ending was unexpected because it was satisfying it was so satisfying that I let out a sigh of relief. I loved this book, I did, and it really makes me want to read the rest of them (when the 330 people who have The Searcher on hold in the public library system are done with that) this book really just showed me what a great author she is, to always give you something unexpected, to always leave you wanting to read more. This is a great great book, and I highly recommend it. "
"Well the story was perfect. I like the suspense in the book. Finally a end to a good series. Well if I look into the series my favourite characters were Cassie, Frank, Steve and of course Conway. The only thing I don't like in the series is the author tries to stretch the story as much as possible making it very boring in the middle. Like in every book we see that middle part gets boring. Conway was satire in this story and all the stories in the series has a Epiphany moment we're you realise what's what and what's not. This series can be read by order or can read as a standalone. I would suggest it in order because Tana French gives the glimpse of the next detective through the perspective of the world. How others think about the detective. So to get to know the character more from every perspective I would suggest all to read this book in order. The sarcasm of the characters also makes me laugh in the series



Well my final thought is that I have picked up a amazing series to read. I hope that Tana French would continue to write amazing books like this series."
"4.5 stars.

I am a huge Tana French fan and even though her latest didn't work for me, i believe she is a genius. The Trespasser is (till date) the last novel in her Dublin Murder Squad series. A speciality of this series is that every book has a different protagonist. The lead detective who solves the crime in every book is the secondary character in the previous novel.

The Trespasser is the story of a crime as much as it is that of Antoinette Conway, the only woman in the murder squad. The book, which let me be clear is a page turner despite being huge, is as much about the crime and its detection as much as it is about Conway. I absolutely love how French brings her character to life. You are not going to forget her easily after you are done reading the novel.

If you are a fan of the genre and are willing to/interested in reading something beyond the usual thrillers, go for this series."
"I love Tana French novels. You know you are going to get a meaty, twisty story that takes you for a fun ride if you like psych thrillers.

This is the final installment in the Dublin Murder Squad. In classic French style, we have a new lead character, detective Antoinette Conway. She is new to the Dublin murder squad and has hardly been welcomed by the otherwise all male unit. This is the story of the murder of Aislinn Murray. Was it her hot date? Does she have a secret boyfriend? Was it her father or gang related? There are a lot of leads and red herrings chased down to the end. The story telling is vivid and rich. Enjoyable to the end.

Tana French's writing is one of a kind. However, the level of detail and character development that she invests can sometimes slow the story. The interviews of suspects are so full of detail they read like a trial court transcript.

This is not my favorite of the series and I am sad that its the end of it. But, I am looking forward to other new adventures with French!"
"This was my first time reading this author, although I've had friends tell me to read her for years, and I'm glad to say they were right. This book is a face-paced and well-plotted mystery. While part of the ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series it does not have to be read in any order, and instead stands on its own. I'm intrigued about the other books and the different narrators in them.

I usually don't go for mystery a lot of the time, but this was a Book of the Month pick that I've been meaning to read for ages. Also really interesting was a look into Irish life in Dublin, especially all the creative ways to swear! I also found it funny that I finished it right before St. Patrick's day- it seemed oddly fitting!

Def recommend if you want a twisty mystery, a badass female lead and a well-written book."
"It's rare that I read a book where I both love and hate the characters. In The Trespasser, the Dublin Murder Squad is handling the murder case of a pretty young woman, and the rush to charge the obvious killer doesn't sit right with the heroine, Detective Antoinette Conway. Author Tana French leads us through a quagmire of police procedure with red herrings, obnoxious reporters, police misconduct and protection of their own, and downright discrimination toward a female detective. Antoinette Conway's voice is biting, her co-workers' voices are condescending, and her partner is an enigma -- until all is revealed in a predictable but uncomfortable ending. Hilda Fay's reading in the audiobook is compelling and I'm glad I listened to the story rather than reading it. This is the first book I've read from this author, and I plan to check out more."
"Ms. French is excellent as always. She puts the true-ism in the phrase ""people are complicated"".Her stories are always heavily character driven and generally involving a close knit group. In this case the close knit group are the detectives on the murder squad but our main character and narrator of our story is a bit of an outsider, battling the others on her squad.
Antoinette Conway, is quite the unlikeable character with a huge chip on her shoulder. Because of this chip as the story progresses the reader begins to understand that some of what we are being told might be biased and irrational.
I also found the victim to be somewhat unsympathetic but understandable. What was fascinating for me was the parallels between Antoinette and Aislinn though neither would recognize it.
As always the writing itself is gorgeous and Hilda Fays narration is flawless."
"Tana French is one of my favorite authors, and if she could go ahead and start hammering out 1-2 books per year, that would work well for me.

The Trespasser is another terrific book. I wasn't looking forward to getting to know Antoinette after she was so prickly-weird with Stephan in ""The Secret Place,"" but one of French's talents is making you care about characters you didn't think you would. I wanted to be her friend. I continue to LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Moran and wish he was a real guy. Although there was a plot twist that was a little too coincidental (can't say bc spoilers), I still stayed up until 2 a.m. to finish despite a 5:30 alarm.

Which detective will be French's focus next? I'd kind of like a book about Sophie, though she's not technically on the Murder Squad."
"This is the only Tana French novel that I've given less than 5 stars. I'll be up front that I will never miss a Tana French novel, and her worst day is better than most other writings living. :) I loved the writing here, as always. The plot, though, was not as compelling and fascinating as her other books. I read the book in my usual devouring fashion, but I didn't miss sleep as I have in the past. Additionally, the narrator's voice (Antoinette Conways) just was not compelling to me; perhaps she suffers in comparison to the other narrators such as Frank Mackey of ""Faithful Place"" or Cassie Maddox of ""The Likeness"". Still, this is a top-notch detective procedural, and I can recommend it without reservation."
"3.5, but I rounded up because French pulled it out at the end.

As other reviewers have mentioned, Conway's unrelenting paranoia and the massive chip on her shoulder wore on the story. This book could have been 30% shorter, imho.

On the other hand, French is the best at sucking the reader down a false trail, not once, not twice, but at least 4 times in this book. That ability alone kept me going long after I feel I should have given up on the book.

I enjoyed Fay's reading and acting. The one distraction I had was that her pronunciation of names was the exact opposite of the narrator of the last series entry. In that book, Conway's now partner was Steve More-AN. In this book, he was MORE-un. CosTELLo became COSTello. Interesting, but periodically pulled me out of the story as I pondered accents and pronunciations.

I also found myself wondering if this would be the last of the Dublin Murder Squad books. French seems to have painted herself into a bit of a corner as subjects go. We shall see...."
"4.5 stars






I want to sit down with Detective Antoinette Conway in an Irish pub tossing back a pint or two and mouthing ""shite"" in every other sentence. She is one edgy, feisty, smart, flawed woman. She's part Detective Jane Tennison, part DSI Stella Gibson with a dash of Detective Christine Cagney.



The Tresspasser is a great detective novel that slowly unravels the mystery of what appears at first to be a slam dunk, ""the boyfriend did it"" murder. The book is heavy on dialogue between detectives, suspects and possible suspects to reveal the truth. What a great read. This is my first Tana French novel, but not the last."
"I love these books! So much! Tana French is brilliant. Each book is as good as the last - there’s nothing formulaic about them, they don’t blend together or feel the same. They don’t get boring. The characters are brilliant and the situations are so believable. I can’t quite get enough!

I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Our main character got a little angsty, and felt sorry for herself, but while it may have been a bit over reactive, I understood and believed it, so I didn’t get exasperated it with it. I adore Steve and love how the two of them connect without even looking at each other. It’s just so good. I highly recommend!!!"
"This book, this series hooked me right in and I feel disappointed that its done. The whodunnit always surprises me, French keeps you guessing by throwing this uncertainty and that unknown variable in your way to leave you wondering. Your detective du jour or should I say du livre gets into your heart and you love them foibles and all and want them to get the bad guy. The interesting thing about this whole series is that she doesn't keep the same main character but with the exception of the first book you know them from a previous storyline. I would have read this series just as quickly if I hadn't been quarantined but I am glad it was around when I was. "
"4.5

Very solid crime fiction, with enough twists and turns to keep me page turning. There were moments where it felt like the story was being dragged out a little bit, but French managed to bring it back well, such that losing interest wasn't a given.

Not 100% sure on the ending, but that's because I like to know what happened beyond a wink and a nod (though the crime was solved and it was made pretty clear what would happen, so maybe I am asking for too much). If you like the genre, it's an excellent example and you should give it a read.

I am now looking forward to going back and reading other books in French's collection."
"Great book. Really enthralling - binged it. Unfortunately it still isn’t the best in the series for me by far and I also wasn’t as interested in this set of detectives. Still very worth it though! 3.5/5


“Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.”

“I live inside my own skin. Anything that happens outside it doesn’t change who I am.”

“We sit there, drinking, while the stuff we should probably be saying out lohd gets itself done in the silence.”

"
"Tana French writes police procedurals with such detail that you have to slow down and take your time reading her books. This is the 6th in her Dublin Murder Squad series and features the same detectives from the previous book. Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran have worked all Saturday night and solved one murder and on the way out the door, they are sent to a simple domestic. Conway is having a hard time fitting in with the rest of the Murder Ds and of course, this simple case may not be what it seems. The lack of evidence and the what ifs tie Conway and Moran up in knots, but eventually, they realize where the truth lies."
"4.5 stars out of 5

I picked up this book after looking into if I could read it as a standalone and after finding I could, I dug right in.

I really enjoyed the twists and intrigue you got from following Conway's perspective. The detective work depicted the amount of work involved in an actual investigation, and the frustration of the detectives when their leads turn up dry.

The high drama surrounding the situation is unexpected at some points and very trope-y in others, which led to a fun adventure with the detective you were rooting for (despite their somewhat unlikable nature at certain points).

I loved this book enough to want to look into the rest of the series. Additionally, if you love an Irish accent, I highly recommend the audiobook!"
"It’s not quite four stars. More like 3.5 because I didn’t start to like the book until about 2/3 of the way through. The voice of the protagonist is a bit hard to take. She’s angry, resentful, paranoid that the world is out to get her but she acknowledges all of this towards the end which is good. The crime itself is unoriginal. Girl gets killed by a lover but which one? The interesting part of the book was seeing how detectives think and how a murder investigation happens. I was pleasantly surprised by the resolution. I also enjoyed the relationship and banter between the protagonist and her police partner. "
"this was such a solid series. each with a different narrator and therefore a different tone, but all with the author’s overarching style. the way she weaves a story and builds characters throughout is really wonderful. setting played less of a factor in this book than some of her others, but it didn’t diminish my enjoyment of the novel. as always, i enjoy wondering how her stories will end. there’s no such things as a sewn-up-tight happy endings in her books. but there haven’t been any disappointing endings yet either. "
"I went into this story w/o a synopsis, just knowing it was Tana French. One of my favorite authors. Well I'm thinking I may have to revise that thought a little.
I mean I really enjoyed her last book but this one maybe 3.75 stars actually. And I think I may have given similar results for 3 & 4. The book is about murder of a young woman who's lead a sheltered life due to care taking her mother after her father's done a runner early in her life,but has he really? She finally meets someone who she connects with but does she really? He becomes the prime suspect and fits it all but does he really? The pair investigating are good together but are they really? The female D.C., has been taking a lot of nasty ribbing in the squad and feels it's her against the world except for her partner and then she wonders is he all part of some elaborate plan to make her look the fool, but is he really?
This was how it went through out the whole book, mostly. I found it somewhat frustrating and paranoid but hang in there it gets done and all becomes clear."
"Tana French is an auto-buy author for me. Her writing is just that good. She elevates the mystery murder novel from gore, serial killers and CSI forensics to literary fiction with emotional and psychological depth and beautiful prose. “The Trespasser” was no exception. While it wasn’t my favorite in the series, I still enjoyed every minute of the 20 plus hours of narrated audiobook moments. Hilda Fay did a very nice performance for audible.
I also like that this series can be read out of order, since each novel centers around a different lead detective.
"
A Murder Squad book this one has all of these books follow detectives of one particular unit. This murder is about a young woman who is murdered in her upscale apartment. The two young detectives assigned to the case investigate. While a senior detective tries to put the blame on the boyfriend. But clearly this isn't the case. I find the world of these detectives interesting as they unravel the case even though it points to a fellow senior detective.
"Similar to all of the other Dublin Murder Squad books (with the exception of the first), it took a few chapters to get into this book. And just like the previous books, I was hooked once the plot gained some speed. This book had a lot of twists and turns and kept you guessing until the very end. I love how Tana French keeps using different characters as the narrator, but ones that you've seen as a side character in previous books. Like the ones before it, I did not expect the ending. And I have no idea what she will do with the next one but can't wait to read it"
"Another great book by Tana French. Her protagonist is so alienated from the rest of her mates on the Dublin Murder Squad that it’s amazing that she ever gets anything done. In fact there are times reading her books that I wonder if I’m ever going to get done. Her twists and turns, however, keep me coming back and I have come to suspect a surprise and satisfactory ending. I love her stuff despite (or maybe because) she always rewards the struggle through the morass. "
"Although The Trespasser is 6th in the Dublin Murder Squad series and I didn't read the previous 5, I never felt lost. Conway is the chick cop in the murder squad and there is so much tendion in that office that it felt like she was fighting them and herself the whole time. This case was a good one to step into this world with. I'm also really glad I was able to get the audiobook from the library for this. It makes the interview scenes so much more when I can hear what the narrator adds to those scenarios. So glad I won this one and can now add it to my read BOTM shelf."
This is the last book of the Dublin Murders! The series was different from what I expected but I am glad that I read them all. They are all so well written and the characters seem real. This one was Moran and Conway from book 5. I didn't get as emotionally tied to the case #3 and #4 got me!) but I was invested in the case. I would recommend this series to someone who liked crime but more of a focus on on character development and detective minute details. 
"Well this took over my last two days when I had so much else to do. Another compulsive read from Tana French; this one pays a lot of attention to the stories we tell, and make, about ourselves; relating this theme to the problem of solving the crime (which is finding the story). Also appreciated the ways in which the first crime, around which the story is built, is a man in power withholding information from a woman ""for her own good"". Not as riveting as The Secret Place and annoyingly explanatory and *so much dialogue*, could have been 100 pages shorter. That said, if it had been 100 pages longer, I would still be merrily chomping through it."
"Actually more of a 4.5. Tana French never disappoints, but this might be my favorite yet. The character development was excellent, I loved the depiction of the partnership between Conway and Moran, the twists and turns kept me guessing right up to the end. This was an audiobook, and the narration was also excellent. "
"I am not a big fan of mysteries or crime novels, but this is something very unique. The writing is tight and intense, the characters well-developed and pull the reader into the story. The description of the detective operation has a strong feel of authenticity. Although the perpetrator is slowly revealed, I don’t feel manipulated by the author as I often do with this genre.

Tana French is a superb writer and a wonderful storyteller."
"One thing about French...no skimming through pages of boring dialogue. You know who those lazy writers are, right? We all do. Her first-person dialogue, including what she is thinking, is so well crafted readers won’t want to skip a word of it. It is often funny, brazenness , raw, or uncensored. If it’s only your thoughts, why censor yourself?

Her characters are multi dimensional, richly cast, and complex with human motivations. Her stories are unpredictable with lots of twists. She continues to be one of my favorite writers!!"
I ended up reading this book ahead of the 4th and 5th book in the series and it may have lost some its punch due to that. I always enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad but I felt as though I was playing catch up most of the time. It did finally come nicely together in the last quarter of the book so still a great read! I like French's highly distinctive characters so much!
"Really 4 1/2+ . Detective novel that takes place in Dublin, Ireland. I truly enjoyed this book. The mystery kept me guessing until the very end. The ending did not disappoint. It was very difficult to put down. I listened to the audio version while I read and that was 5 stars, outstanding narration."
"Antoinette reflects that the culture of the Murder Squad used to be good but changed after one of the detectives left. I wonder if that detective was Scorcher Kennedy - reviled as plodding by Frank Mackey but actually the glue that held the place together.

I wasn't as deeply moved by this addition to the Dublin Murder series but it is a very interesting look at a bunch of people getting tangled up in their various stories."
"This is the first Tana French I have read, though I note it's #6. That didn't matter, either in getting to know the Squad characters or understanding their prejudices against each other. Typical competitive workplace actually!
I loved the Dublin setting and the craic is tidy!
I was a bit daunted at first as this is a lengthy novel and the print is tiny! That said, I was absorbed very quickly - one by the plot, and two by the interactions between squad members which is well peppered with hilarious Irish slang. French is an author who gives you a blow by blow account of literally every thought, dialogue and description.
Some might find this irksome but I like that kind of thing when it's in a story this well written."
"This one stands out from the other Dublin Murder Squad books. Tana French is, of course, a master of psychogeographic horror — the subjective experience of places / landscapes / cityscapes and how that affects the mind. Her other books attach that concept to physical locations: the woods, the students’ house, the neighborhood, the housing development, the boarding school. THE TRESPASSER attaches it to the squad itself, and has an absolute field day with the landscape of rooms and relationships that make up the squad’s connections.

This took me a while to see, but once I did see it, I thought the execution was a little less deft than French typically is. Throughout the book, there are little notes of psychogeography that seem like holdovers from her other books. I would have liked to see these more seamlessly integrated: more of them, maybe, or less jarring.

The mystery itself comes together in the form of endless conversations: concealments, revelations. Talking around the edges of things that are hidden. It’s masterful work; the finest parts of this book are the interviews with Rory, Lucy, and McCann.

I get that the gang subplot is meant to complement the squad psychogeography and the what-if of the statements, but for me it went on just a little too long, and our protagonist changed her mind about it a few too many times for me.

Overall: a lovely Tana French book, but not the best Tana French book. Doesn’t quite have the same emotional gut punch of the others. Still masterful, still worth rereading a dozen times over."

"This one made up for The Witch Elm entirely. I was hoping my girl Tanya French wouldn’t do me like that again. Good mystery setup and good solve. Sometimes I felt a little lost in all the dithering about unimportant details for the sake of putting a vivid picture into the reader’s mind, but in all fairness that could be because I read this thing unmedicated—a weekend read. Otherwise good read when you get past that."
"Probably her best novel besides In These Woods. The outcast murder detective Antoinette Conway is given a case of a young woman getting killed in her own house while preparing a nice dinner for a date. She is getting no help from the murder squad that hates her, and being led in the wrong direction by the arrogant det. Bresling.

Very suspenseful with twists a plenty."
I've read all the others in this series and have to say this is not one of my favorites. I found the paranoid attitude of the main detective just a bit too over the top so that it became distracting. 
This is another great Tana French detective novel.the interrogations are so fascinating and the interactions of the characters in the police force keep the action going. The character development is great. Takes place in Ireland as usual. 
"In the mood for a murder mystery? This one was pretty good. I liked the setting and the story was well written. I listened to it on audio and the narrator was really good. Loved her thick Irish accent.
~Solid 4 stars~"
"I love pretty much everything Tana French writes, and this is one of her best. For me, nothing has topped Broken Harbor, but this book has all of her trademarks: smoothly flowing prose, tight plot, complex characters, and authentic dialogue that really lets the reader ""hear"" what the characters sound like. This book did get a little slow at times, but really picked up in the last third or so, and by the end was going full-tilt and I wasn't sure how it was all going to wrap up. Hopefully French is already working on her next book!"
"This book took a long time- too long- to get going. Once it picked up, it was much more interesting, but it took awhile to get to that point. It’s a good story but could have been told in less than 400+ pages!"
"Oh man, die letzten Kapitel. Da ging's noch mal ordentlich zur Sache. Vorallem die Plottwists, welche ich mal wieder nicht habe kommen sehen. Fantastisch ♡ die Dialoge, die Charaktere, die Ermittlungen!"
"Another good mystery from Tana French. You really get to know the main character, a female detective in an all male murder squad. She knows she and her partner are good but with all that goes on around them she has her doubts in their abilities. I’m sure it is much like any job where a woman has to go beyond to prove herself and earn the respect of the other officers. "
"A young murder detective and her partner have been handed an easy case! In everyone's eyes but theirs the case if open and shut. Soon, the detectives find that the murder of the young woman is tied to the police department in which they work. A good read!"
"It didn’t take me more than 100page to get over loving and hating sensations from slang slinging and narration nagging. Once I got used to it, the plot never ceased to divert my guessing.
With residual doubt on Ash’s credibility I still hold, quite a achievement to make all characters normal and genuine human being without interference of psycho, mental, and pure evil."
"3.5 stars. Interesting look at gender dynamics, especially within and around the sausage fest that is the Murder Squad. Great dialogue and satisfying resolution. The parallel of Antoinette and Aislinn with respect to their fathers felt too over-the-top and obvious, though."
"I've really enjoyed the Tana French books, and I'm kind of sad that I'm almost totally caught up to them now. There, I said it.

The audiobook version of this one is exceptionally well read, as well."
"Like all the books in this series, French gets down to the heart of what it means to be a murder detective. It’s more a psychological internal battle than a battle of wits with an external mark. This one moved fast. Always second guessing and playing what-if and maybe. It was damn good. "
"Just finished the audio version of The Trespasser. It was very entertaining. Well written for sure. As much as I enjoyed the story, it was the deep development of the characters that was the high point. The expertise of the narrator was tops!"
"I disliked the previous book in the series so much I was afraid I had lost my taste for the series but I was pleased to get back on track for this book. Good strong characters, the victim appears to be a shallow, plastic person but Tana French proves things are not always what they seem. "
"This one took a while to get into; the main character is somewhat tiresome at the beginning, but the story is usual-Tana French complex but fair, and as Antoinette becomes more self-aware, I had a hard time putting it down. Very satisfying by the end."
I dare say that was the best book of the series. I knew whodunit two days ago and dragged out the last bit of reading because I didn’t want it to end. This was my favorite MC by far and now I’m gonna go sulk about how the series is over. 
"This is the first book of Tana French I’ve read and have enjoyed it. I read the audible version and Hilda Fey the narrator was brilliant. Characters were all coming to life in a very believable scenario. A bit long and had to strain to catch the Irish accent, but loved it all the same."
"Enjoyed this to start with, I laughed out loud at Antoinette’s internal dialogue, but as it progressed I felt the tension slacken and by the end it was really a case of closing the rather drawn-out ending. We all knew who the murderer was by 3 quarters of the book ( if not earlier)... Still, I enjoyed it enough."
"I didn't read this in a day -- more like two? Three? I messed up updating. Anyway, I loved this, because I love Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran, period. And I love how Tana French draws a character. Loved it. "
"This was a doozy! I would say this is now my favorite in the series. I listened to it and it definitely was a bonus that the narrator had an Irish lilt. Lovely. Good story, good mystery, nice character development and juicy drama. End of. "
Tana French is one of my favorite authors and the Dublin Murder Squad books are great. All the characters are so believable and interesting. The twist and turns keeps you on your toes and when you've finished a book you cant wait to read the next one.
Classic Tana French - I always really enjoy her Dublin Murder Squad books and this was no exception (I also read this one with Josh which was fun). Her writing is just really good and makes my brain work a little bit harder than it normally does while reading mysteries/thrillers 
The best part of these books aren’t the mysteries. It’s the complicated detectives and their relationships. It constantly draws me in. The mystery is fine but I like how they bring up different things for the protagonists. 
"Tana French writes novels in which you can submerge. A lot of the book is dialogue. She creates worlds that you miss being a part of, when the book is finished. "
"Ok- so, it was far fetched. But I just don't care. Tana French is my spirit animal, and I love her. I will always love her, and I die a little when I finish one of her books because it means I have to wait years for another. I make them last as long as I can. Thank you for another turn in the squad, Tana. See you in a few years. "
LOVE Tana French. Interesting thoughts on what gives people power over each other. 
"I agree with my friend Kristine, one of her best!"
This is def the best in the series
4.5
The stories we tell ourselves that shape our lives is an underlying theme of this fascinating mystery.
"Another solid Tana French mystery. I really liked the main character, Antionette. There were a few twists but mostly this was a straightforward tale of murder and whodunnit. "
"It took a little while to get engaged, but actually turned out to be a good read!"
"My favorite Tana French so far! Kept me intrigued until the very end, with a culprit I never saw coming."
"I thought there were a few twists near the end where it got a bit dodgy, but it's another solid French book. Love her dialogue and the exploration of squad dynamics."
"Man, this started off slow as all Hell, but really picked up in the end, really stressing me out at one point. Loved it."
It took awhile to read but it was me and not the book. Good read but I don’t feel I am justified in saying more than that based on how distracted I was while reading it. 
My first Tana French - won’t be my last. 
Fun read. Good suspense. Could have been a hair shorter but really liked it.
This novel is just as good as the previous five. 
"More Dublin Murder Squad books, please! I've just devoured the last three, and I can totally understand why everyone raves about this series."
Conway and Moran are together again solving another murder mystery. What seems an easy domestic abuse case gets a little more difficult the more they find out. I enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad Series.
"This is my third Tana French book, and I’ve liked all of them. So far, there is some overlap of characters- minor ones - but I haven’t felt in the dark even though I haven’t read them quite in order. So far, all have been murder mysteries, but the thing I’ve enjoyed as much as the plot twisting whodunnit aspect of each novel (and there are twists!), is the depth to which the reader gets to know the detectives, their backstories, their psyches and relationships, and how that helps them to solve the crimes.
I’ll keep reading this series."
I did enjoy this book but it seemed a bit long winded.
4.5 stars
Thank you Liz for suggesting the audio of this! The Irish narrator was awesome!
My first Tana French and I was impressed. This was an interesting take on the detective story with most of the “action” actually occurring in the interrogation room. It was riveting at times. I will definitely be reading more. 
"First 300 pages were so so, but the back 150 pages...this is a Tana French mystery! Sorry to see the end (for now?) of this series, but look forward to re-reading most of them."
"Gaffney, gaffer, gaff- so many times. Still good story"
Here's hoping Tana French is hard at work on further Dublin Murder Squad series. They are so good!
Another great addition. The final resolution surprised the heck out of me...in a good way. 
A genuine good read. That slow Tana French burn that you're not sure where it's headed.
7/10
"During this time of COVID, I started reading this series. It was good because I couldn't focus on much and I would just read them one after another. I didn't have to think about what I was going to read next, which was great. Because I couldn't choose anything.
But now, they are still fun. But they are getting to be a bit formulaic.
Still good."
"Re-read April 2021.

Man, I love this series. Here's hoping Tana French decides to revisit it one day."
Solid read and hoping Tana French is not really done with the Dublin Murder Squad. 
"I did not think that this was #6 in a series, I like this detective and hope to read more about her. It was a bit long, but when I thought that this was the first in the series I was fine with that, thought it was introducing the detective, I will look for what came before.
"
Brilliant! Can't believe this series is over.
"My first proper murder mystery in ages; just when I was getting annoyed, this book would drop another suspenseful breadcrumb. Helped this wee-margined, long-chaptered book feel like it kept moving. "
"I don't know how she does it but sheesh, she's good! A skootch too long but super satisfying all the same. "
"This is a good series that could be a bit shorter, but overall is a solid mystery series. As with other non-American series, I enjoy ""hearing"" the slang and linguistic differences that make this more enjoyable.

If you need a solid mystery series, this is a good one."
"I was afraid to pick this book up, because of my reading slump.
But I underestimated Tana French‘s writing style. I love her so much!
This book was so good, it made me sad to finish it."
"Sort of fizzled out at the end for me, but an enjoyable listen and I would love to pop back into this world again."
This was definitely my favorite in the series.
Love Tana French. No one does characters and police procedurals like her. Her books are a brilliant slow burn. I enjoyed every minute.
Good suspenseful murder mystery.
"Tana French is just so talented. I don’t kill myself guessing the answers the whole time because her writing is so good, it just propels you through it. A sound ending to this series."
Great plot. I would have given it 5 stars but the main character annoyed the hell out of me.
Really kept me guessing! 
"Ah, finalmente un French come si deve! Atmosfera fantastica, personaggi complessi al punto giusto, protagonista imperfetta, caso interessante e pieno di piste possibili. Ottimo, lo suggerirei."
"Listened to the audiotape which I enjoyed because the narrator had an Irish accent - very appropos.

Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.
Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner.
And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be."
There are always elements of these books where you have to let it be kind of unrealistic but I stayed up until 3 am to find out what happened so safe to say I was hooked. 
I’ve been into murder mysteries lately and for the most part loved this one. I felt the stress and frustration and fear of the characters building throughout the book. I was often annoyed with the main character because of how defensive she is all the time and how mean she is to literally everyone. The ending is so worth it though. One of my favorite parts is the first paragraph of chapter 14. 
"I don't read a lot of mysteries, but Tana French is absolutely one of my favorite authors. This book did not disappoint at all. I started it when I was sick, so I was able to read about 300 pages that first day. She had me hooked and it killed me to put the book down. Her understanding of human behavior is stunning. She writes in a different narrator's voice in each book and she pulls it off unbelievably well every time. If you're good with gritty murders set in contemporary Ireland and tons of cursing, read anything and everything she's written. "
A real page turner with a very authentic story. Will definitely be reading more by this author
"THE TRESPASSER: Generally I’m not a big mystery lover. The Trespasser could change my mind. The story is that of a murder, the detectives are the Murder Squad and the place is Ireland. Once I got used to the phraseology, I was hooked ! I will most likely read the series of 6 ( so far ) books."
"fantastic characters, dialogue, story, and writing. And the narrator, Hilda Fay, well she was superb."
"I really enjoyed this one. Tana French is a fantastic writer, and the more predictable elements of the story were balanced out by fantastic characterization."
"I wasn't completely hooked at the beginning, but like always with Tana Franch at the end I was deeply enthralled. "
I can’t wait for the new Tana French book due out this fall. They just keep getting better and better.
easy read with an unexpected depth in characters. some drawn-out interrogation passages but overall a good read.
So well written 
"So enjoyed this police procedural. A little leaner than some of French's earlier Dublin Murder Squad novels, which gave it great narrative drive.
"
Nobody develops characters or writes dialog as well as Tana French. Another excellent installment in the series.
Stumbled upon this book. I know this author but didn't realize she also wrote the Murder squad.
Listened to this one...I enjoyed the deep dive into the thought processes of the characters. Seemed a heavier psychological focus than her others I've read. Proper review might follow...or might not.
Ich mag ja Ermittler-Krimis :)
I'm never disappointed by Tana French! This one was well paced and suspenseful with a wonderful and different cast of characters. Looking forward to grabbing another book written by this author!
"I love absolutely every word Tana French writes. She’s ingenious. This book is amazing. Highly, highly recommend. "
"Excellent writing and a good story. But...it was so long. I realize the detail may be needed to make you understand how the police work. After each interrogation, I was ready to c0nfess myself. I didn't guess the ending ahead of time. That's a good thing. Who does the title refer to?"
This one is fluffy as hell compared to some of the others but I could read a billion Conway and Morans and never get tired of it lol
"Out of all of her books, this is the one I could most imagine being made into a movie. The plot itself was interesting, but I also liked the context of the experience of Detective Conway. I'd actually have liked a little more with that, as it felt kind of squeezed in at times. "
I love this series!
"Although this was the 6th in the series, and my first one, enjoyed it very very much. Interesting detective heroine and story that keeps you guessing. "
4.5 ⭐️
"I love Tana French’s’ books. However, there are times when her extensive attention to detail just becomes too much and frustrates me. That said, there isn’t another writer with her turn of phrase or imagery. I’d read anything she wrote, even a grocery list!! Still enjoying the Dublin Murder Squad!!"
One of the good books in the series. Impressive way the author changes pov in each book.
"This was actually pretty good, I’m just still not sure that detective novels are for me."
okay but the way i would watch the SHIT out of this as a tv mini series. the slow build/burn keeps you intrigued all the way through. the narration was also a yes from me!! 
"I haven't yet read The Secret Place so I felt a little out of step with this one, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the book as much as I would have otherwise. It just made me want to know the backstory, which is a good thing. Antoinette is a truly flawed narrator but the author's always in control of it. That is, in moments where you want to smack her upside the head the author obviously knows that's a reasonable reaction and ultimately the character is very much rootable.

The theme of this book is how difficult it is to see objectively around the stories you make up in your head. Multiple characters trip themselves up by feeding everything around them into their own inner narrative, but that's a fascinating thing to watch. I especially loved the victim in this one. Throughout the opening sections Antoinette has nothing but contempt for her, but in the end she wins her respect--and mine too. You can see why Antoinette can't help but be hard on her, but learns a lesson in the end that other characters probably won't be able to learn."
Thoroughly enjoyable and thankfully without supernatural elements this time around. Would be thrilled to see more of Conway down the road!
I actually really enjoyed this one. Good plot twists and I liked the strong female character. I would definitely try others of hers.
"4.5

My thoughts on The Trespasser are very similar to my thoughts on The Secret Place (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... Both captured the vibe on the first two books that the third and forth lacked, but also show French learning from what did and did not work about the previous books.

Overall: an excellent addition to the series."
3.75 stars 
The first Tana French book I read was Broken Harbor and I really didn’t like it. But I gave her another chance and I’m really glad I did because I’ve loved everything else I’ve read. 
"Very methodical book with a surprise ending. I enjoy her detailed investigation and cross-examinations. It’s definitely a slow burn, but I liked it. "
"If it'd been anyone else's book, it might be four stars, but from Tana French? I just found this disappointingly pedestrian. Alas."
One of my favorites in the the Dublin Murder Squad series. With lots of red herring leads and twists it leaves you guessing till the big reveal.
"Tato série patří mezi moje nejoblíbenější a zůstane to tak i po tomto dílu. Je to jako vždycky, pomalé vyšetřování, sem tam nějaká slepá ulička...tohle prostě Tana umí! Jen hlavní hrdinku jsem občas nemohla vydýchat."
4.5 stars. Half a star knocked off really just because I felt it was a little too drawn out. I really enjoy the style of Tana French’s writing though. I think she builds up characters well. 
"""Trespassers"" was a battle, not only to solve the case with proof, but a battle among the detectives. Tanya French always portrays the true character of the detective. Although the story seemed to drag a little, it did not disappoint this reader. Good book."
Tana forever!!!!
"I love her so much, but this one was so so so so long. I would've cut 75-100 pages and it still would've been great. I love Conway and I love the Inside Baseball of the whole book-- the discussions on the squad, the interview techniques, etc. "
Up there with the best books in the series. Perfect beach read.
An excellent book! I listened to it on audio and the reader did an excellent job. This one has a different feel to it than the previous books. The previous mystery that is normally included is a much smaller element than in the other books. The mystery itself is good and the pacing is great. Strong recommendation. 
"I gave up on this series after book 3 and swore I was done with Tana French as an author. Then I read The Searcher and really enjoyed it so I thought I’d give the old Murder Squad another look.

Glad I did. I gave this one 4 stars and will go on the next. The first in the series is grand but skip the next two. Seriously."
"Tana French is the queen at weaving mysteries! I love her snarky humor, her dialogue, the gritty details…all of it!"
"I could not put it down. Sort of saw the solution coming from a way back, but it didn't matter--the characters are wonderful. The voice of Antoinette Conway, the narrator, never falters, and her relationship with her partner is perfectly depicted. This may be my favorite of French's books so far, and I've loved them all."
Badass female murder detective in Ireland. Focus isn't on whodunit so much as why they did it and delving into the people investigating the murder. 
Started off a little slow but it got gooooood. 
"French redeems herself with this novel. The characters had to grow on me, and by the time the end was nearing, I was already starting to miss them. I enjoyed this book. "
"This book is perfect to listen to, because it's so conversational. And that Irish brogue is intriguing and addictive. :)"
"This one hooked me right away. It's a small, almost insular story that doesn't bank everything on the mystery. I think it was clear-eyed in the way that it approached the fact that being a woman of color on a homicide unit in Ireland seeps into every moment of the lead character's work and life. Having to distinguish what is part of the crappy world we live in and what is part of the intrigue going on around her highlights how insidious discrimination is. Her identity never became the story, yet she, and I as a reader, could not escape it, and that I think was part of what made the book captivating."
"Another enjoyable Tana French mystery! Honestly, not certain how it was going to come out until the last chapter!"
"3.75 Stars --

I've just completed a reread of 4 of French's Dublin Murder Squad books, with this being the last. I think prior to my rereads, I would have said this was the weakest of them (The Likeness, Broken Harbor, The Secret Place, and this) but now I'd say this one has the edge over The Secret Place.

The Likeness is my favorite book of all time, and Broken Harbor is up there as well. The Trespasser is good, but perhaps not great, and The Secret Place is... fine.

I'm of two minds regarding this book. The first is that it is very engaging - like all of French's Murder Squad books, it's hard to put down, despite being long. She is a masterful writer - there is no question about that. I was never bored, despite the length.

The second is that.... ehhhh. Unlike The Likeness and Broken Harbor, the resolution to this mystery just doesn't sit right with me. I think I felt the same way the first time I read it as well - it's just off. I want to get behind the explanation as credible, behind how Aislinn's character is said to have felt and acted, but I just can't. It just doesn't felt realistic to me, no matter how good French's attempts are to make it feel right.

This also really seems to suffer from a case of the ""this should have been obvious."" And it does something that is incredibly hard to swallow in mysteries - one character knows the entire answer the entire time, and there is really no good reason they shouldn't have just coughed it up in the very beginning and saved everyone the read. When the character does finally open up, they literally dump the entire plot and explanation in our laps.

For one last major complaint, I did not buy the ending at all. I understand that to leave it without a justice-being-fully-served resolution would have probably stung too much to do, but I do believe it would have been more credible. Instead French has to try to twist the narrative enough that we get that resolution. It's a case where I can feel the author inserting themselves into the story to guide in a direction it doesn't feel it would go, and that sucks. 
I'm referring to McCann deciding to just confess at the end, especially in front of Steve and Conway. I don't buy it. I don't think he would have - despite French's sincere attempts to make me believe there was a reason for him to.

With as many complaints as I'm pointing out, it might seem odd that I'm still rating this so highly... but there is no denying that the writing is a significantly higher level of quality than most thriller/suspense books out there.

I also want to talk about Conway's character a bit. She is pretty deeply unlikable, but it's interesting how well this winds up working. A lot of the book, I'm internally rolling my eyes over a lot of the thoughts she has and her attitudes in general. But French does a great job with this. It's obvious to the reader that Conway is wrong, but it is clear that Conway (whose head we are in the whole time) is fully committed to her beliefs. If Conway didn't eventually start realizing the error of her ways and seem to be willing to give things a shot with a better attitude, it'd be pretty irredeemable, but thankfully she does, and her growth is solid.

Going to end this review with a moment of sadness that French seems to have abandoned the Murder Squad series. I really hope she goes back to it, because The Witch Elm was a disappointment... lacking the suspension and tension I think the Murder Squad books have. And from what I've read about The Searcher, I haven't even been willing to try it.

Original Review:
It's quite good, I just didn't find it as mind blowingly awesome and life changing as my favorite Tana French books. I thought the ending was a bit more guessable, and I didn't find it as moving. That being said, it's still a great read."
Another escape tome but what psychological fun. I am enjoying her stories and the the escape factor is helping me avoid the reality of the current news.
Always like my annual Tana French Irish detective novel.
Loved it... only issue is it could have been a lot shorter. Too many long winded interview scenes which didn't add to it at all. But overall another epic
"I seriously don't get sick of Tana French's writing.
Her character development is exceptional - she absolutely gets under their skin and right into their heads, building real life people whose story you want to follow.
Her research around the machinations inside of a murder squad appears to be exceptional also - although not having worked in one, I'll have to assume she's on the ball.
And, best of all, she writes a fantastic, compelling yarn. I can't wait for the next one."

****Four out of Five Stars
Review by: Mark Palm

Perhaps it’s a byproduct of the violence of American society, but too often in thrillers, both in cinema and in books, writers feel that they can only transfix and hold our attention by a steady escalation in violence and an ever-higher body count. When characters are made of straw it’s all too easy to mow them down like such, and no-one pays any mind. In The Trespasser Tana French does the opposite, and reminds us, with depth and care, that one life has enormous meaning, and that one death can resonate with surprising circumstances and broad effect.

The Trespasser is set in the Dublin Murder Squad, and features Detective Antoinette Conway, for whom, like many police, feel that the Murder Squad is the peak of their profession. Conway is a woman in a man’s world, and as smart and aggressive as she is, her time in the Murder Squad has been nothing but an endless series of pranks, insults and harassment that makes her believe that any day may be her last. In this atmosphere Conway ends up as the lead on her first big case, along with her partner, Stephen Moran, and both are almost disappointed that the case seems like a simple domestic dispute gone wrong. A young woman named Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home, seemingly from a blow to the head. A dinner for two is set on the table, and she appeared to have a date with a bookstore owner named Rory Fallon. On the surface it seems simple, but one after another of the obvious hypotheses falls apart. Other members of the squad, especially the menacing Breslin, seem unusually eager to nail Fallon, and the victim, Aislinn, is familiar to Conway, but the detective cannot remember from where. Once she digs into her past Conway finds an iron will masked beneath an almost cliched version of femininity.

This depth is one of Ms. French’s greatest strengths. It’s not that difficult for a skilled plotter to create twists and turns, but it takes an expert to make them both surprising and inevitable, and here the author does it again and again. Just when I thought I could see where things were going a small turn would catch me unawares; such as the similarities between Conway’s past and Aislinn’s. At first the two women really seem as different as night and day, but the eventual parallels between them rise from circumstance naturally, with nuance and care, and never once feels forced or fake.

Character is another place where Ms. French shines. All of the characters have depth and insight, but also a certain distance that Ms. French uses to keep us on our heels. Even Conway, who narrates the book, and whose point of view informs us, remains a bit of a mystery. The parts of Conway that we do see , and her first-person voice ,help bring a brisk and unstinting energy to the book. The detective’s voice seems unstudied and casual, but Ms. French wrings great nuance from it. I found it particularly effective when read aloud, a test that many novels do not pass.
Brash, fearless, and smart, Conway brings an exuberance to the process of being a cop, particularly during the interrogation scenes, that make us feel for her plight without ever making us feel pity for the way her squad treats her. It seems shameful enough to deprive someone who does her job with as much passion as Conway that Ms. French can keep her as abrasive as she wants, and made Conway even more real than ever. That kind of forthright intelligence kept me from making any assumptions about where this book was headed,until the very end, which as I said earlier , is both surprising, and in a way, inevitable. That is about all you can ask from a thriller, and The Trespasser delivers.

"I really enjoyed this book. Interesting characters, story, good writing. Look forward to future Tana French novels.
The main character, Antoinette, is not particularly sympathetic. There are times I really disliked her. But she did some internal examination and showed personal growth. This was interesting. The small side storyline about her father confused me. I’m not sure why it wS germane, but perhaps in a subsequent novel it may be expanded. Nothing in this story made me care whether it is or not.
The crime and it’s solution are fairly intricate. The final confrontation scene was extremely intriguing for me; a complex psychological scenario unfolded.
"
"New psychilogical study with a side od murder. This time, we are in a head of pragmatic, angry woman who gets tangled in a story within a story within a story. What a pain in the ass!

French books are rare treats that take you on a journey in someone else's skin. It was pretty refreshing being Antoinette, because she gets shit done. She also deals with anger and burn-out, so this wasn't cozy at all. It was gut wrenching and uncomfortable, but it had hope so not everything is shit.

Murder itself was pretty predictable and the suspense of disbelief (like, do cops really never see some venues that are open for investigation until they hit them on the nose?) and the ending was a bit anticlimactic."
"Tana French is a genius! I absolutely love the Dublin Murder Squad series and The Trespasser does not disappoint. I have two words for everyone: read it!

This installment has Murder Squad Detective Antoinette Conway as the narrator. Her partner, Stephen Moran, whom you may know from The Secret Place and Faithful Place, has finally made the Murder Squad and is partnered up with Antoinette. Being the only female on the squad, Antoinette continues to be ruthlessly hazed by the more experienced male detectives.

The gaffer, O'Kelley, assigns Conway and Moran a seemingly straightforward murder case. Everything points to a domestic case. Everything except for Breslin, the more experienced detective the gaffer placed on Conway and Morgan's team. He is acting suspicious.

I don't want to give anything else away. Just let me say that the paranoia level in this book is pretty high. Antoinette is convinced everyone on the squad is out to get her and she interprets everything through that lens. It was hard for me to tell whether she was just being paranoid or if everyone really was out to get her.

One of my favorite parts of the book was the theme of making sure you are the star of your own life. Antoinette puts it this way in the book:

""If someone rescues you, they own you... They own you because you're not the lead in your story any more. You're the poor struggling loser/helpless damsel/plucky sidekick who was saved from danger/dishonor/humiliation by the brilliant brave compassionate hero/heroine, and they get to decide which because you're not the one running this story, not any more.""

Antoinette isn't the only one who struggled with taking control of her life in The Trespasser. The victim, the suspects, and other detectives all grappled with it. It was fascinating to see how each character found their own way to star in their own show, so to speak.

Please, please, please do yourself a favor and read this series! You don't absolutely have to start at the beginning, but I would recommend it.

**I received a free copy of The Trespasser thanks to the publisher's Forst to Read program.**"
"As with all the books in this series, it took me a bit to get into. Once I did, however, I was sucked in and loved it. "
"In reality, a 3.5 but her stuff is always so readable I round up. I also like the Conway/Moran team, but this works best if you have Secret Place lead up as character intro for both of them. "
"4.5+, really good"
"Detective- murder-mystery is not my typical genre, but it was a nice change of pace and I actually really enjoyed it."
One of her best!
"The audiobook is narrated by Hilda Fay, dreamy Irish accents galore. Fun murder mystery."
"It seems like a routine murder, maybe one step up from the dreary domestic cases Antoinette Conway has become used to getting in her two years on the Dublin Murder Squad. She and her partner, Stephen Moran, head out to the scene when given the call by the boss, even though they are due to go home. The victim, Aislinn Murray, is all dressed up with the house ready for an intimate dinner with someone. She has fallen backward onto the fireplace, striking her head and bleeding out.

It seems an easy case at first. Lover's quarrel gone wrong. Boyfriend arrives for dinner, something goes awry, a fight occurred, maybe a shove, and suddenly it's tragedy. When they find the man who is coming to dinner, he seems ready-made for the scenario. Rory Fallon is hesitant, a bit of a nerd, someone who seemed unlikely to attract the stunning Aislinn. His story is that they met at his bookstore a month or so ago. They went out to dinner, had a drink and this was the first visit to Aislinn's house and a big step forward in their relationship. He is puzzled and angry when he arrives, rings the bell, waits a bit, texts and then phones her, but never gets a response. After waiting a half hour or so, he finally decides she is blowing him off for some reason and that he has been made a fool. He stomps off angrily and walks home.

The veteran detective, Breslin, helping with the case, is sure it's the routine story it seems to be and is pushing for a quick arrest. But Conway isn't sure. Aislinn's best friend is sure that Aislinn is over the top crazy about this new man in her life. She thinks there may be another man around, one that Aislinn is trying to move out of her life. Other strange things occur. Antoinette sees a man scoping out her street a couple of times. When she goes out to confront him, he is gone. The local pushy newspaper reporter all of a sudden feels free to go over the line and make Antoinette look incompetent and lazy, a move he'd never have had the nerve to do before. Conway is not a favorite on the squad, being the only woman. She has faced two years of harassment and her only friend is her partner and now she's not sure of him either. Can she close the case without making the mistake that gets her punted off the squad?

Tana French is one of the shining stars of mystery writing. Her forte is character development, giving the reader an inside look at the case and personality of a Murder Squad detective as the case slowly unfolds. There is always lots going on beneath the surface and betrayal and evil are quick to slow their faces. Her forte is the stunning conclusion and this novel doesn't disappoint in that regard. This book is recommended for mystery readers."
"This is the sixth book in the outstanding Dublin Murder Squad Series.

The whole book is written in the form of a long monologue delivered by Antoinette Conway, a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad. She hopes she has an ally in her partner, Stephen Moran, because she feels like the rest of the squad is trying to drive her out. She finds spit in her coffee, piss in her locker, her notes go missing, and the reporter who is her nemesis always seems to know where she will be next. To make it worse, she and Steve keep getting assigned to cases that offer only minor challenges.

After working all night, she and Steve get yet another case that seems like a routine domestic violence case. Aislinn Murray is found dead in her cottage, in which a table had been set for a romantic dinner. Texts on Aislinn's phone to her girlfriend showed she was waiting for her boyfriend, and was quite excited about it. But something went very wrong.

Inexplicably and insultingly, to Antoinette and Steve, the boss asks her to add the older, more experienced Detective Breslin to their team. Breslin is smarmy and obnoxious, and tries to push Antoinette and Steve into a quick conviction of the boyfriend, although at first, the evidence is only circumstantial. The two suspect there is more to the case than meets the eye, but they can’t figure out what it might be, or why Breslin is so anxious for them to wrap up the case fast.

As the tension builds, so do the mysteries, and while the ending wasn’t a total surprise, following it unfold by a master of crime writing was for me like watching a masterful drama on stage. Even as you are mesmerized, you can step back enough to appreciate the talent that so thoroughly places you in the midst of another world.

Discussion: Tana French is so good, that my first thought on finishing this book was, “I can’t wait for the next one!” The writing is excellent; French is expert at capturing dialogue and describing a scene so that you can see it yourself, and setting a mood so that you actually sense it, whether menace or hope or fear or anger. She conveys the thoughts of the characters in a way that ensures we know exactly how they feel - such as Antoinette’s growing paranoia and hurt, the increasing desperation of the accused, and the shock felt by one of the other characters when the truth comes out at last.

Evaluation: I loved this book, just as I loved her previous books. I also enjoyed the experience of listening to it on audio. While I would probably have raced through a written version, in this way I was made to savor the story more.

Rating: 4.5/5

"Detective Antoinette Conway has returned to readers at last (first introduced in The Secret Place), and she's as biting and cynical as ever. She and her partner Stephen Moran are assigned to what appears to be a straightforward domestic murder: a young woman found in her own home, death by head trauma, one punch it appears, and one obvious suspect: the new boyfriend. But this is a crime with layers, and every time a new one is peeled away, Conway and Moran find themselves closer to a darkness at the center of it. Who was the victim, really, and who can they trust?

All the Tana French trademarks shine in this newest novel. It's dialogue-driven, witness interviews comprising a fair amount of the book, French's snappy and natural voices pinging off the pages until you can almost hear them in your ear. It's psychology-driven, digging deep into the motivations of everyone involved--victim, suspects, witnesses, and detectives. It's character-driven, as the choices of Conway and others push each piece of the mystery toward its reveal and its resolution, as the partner relationship between her and Steve wobbles and stretches
 and ultimately strengthens (sigh of relief to that!).

And above all, it isn't simple (though at first it might appear to be). There's no writing any of these people off as tropes--they are flawed, vulnerable, sometimes despicable people who breathe long after the book is closed. Conway is suspicious, self-absorbed, insecure, and real. Steve is idealistic, kind, people-pleasing, and real. The victim is both naive and vicious. And real.

I was hoping for at least one scene with Frank Mackey. He and Cassie remain my favorite Tana French characters (and their books remain my favorites as well). However, this one made me care about Antoinette (and love Steve all the more). It seems that whomever French writes about, I'm going to keep reading."
"Having finally read Lost In the Woods earlier this year and mostly enjoyed it, I'm making my way through the rest of French's Dublin-set crime books. This one was a slight notch better to me, in that it doesn't require quite the same level of suspension of disbelief, and really hews firmly to being a police procedural. What makes it more than just another murder story is that it's also a book about the workplace, and the challenges of being a woman in a male-dominated workplace. But not in a way that's over-the-top, rather showing how the indignities can be quite subtle, and how one can actually be rational and overreacting at the same time.

Whether or not you enjoy the book is more or less down to whether or not you enjoy spending time in D.I. Antoinette Conway's head, and to a lesser extent, spending time in her partnership with D.I. Steve Moran, as they navigate what appears to be a relatively straightforward ""domestic."" However, when a veteran D.I. gets assigned to ""assist"" them, the question of just how straightforward the case is starts to loom. And loom it does, over all 450+ pages, in exhaustive (some might say, exhausting) detail. Every investigative twist and turn is given verbatim and examined in detail -- so much so that you can't help but suspect that the author is trying to distract you remembering the one obvious lead that they keep not following up on.

That aside, the story keeps you on edge as it appears to head to one resolution, only to veer to a second, and then a third, before twisting back to a wholly unexpected climax. And whether or not that last twist feels true kind of depends on the extent to which you feel the workplace aspect has been completely established or not. I just about bought it, but I can imagine how others might reach the end and throw it across the room. Still, well worth reading if you like strong female detectives and/or procedure-heavy murder mysteries."
"This book did a great job of showing a murder investigation in all its nitty-gritty detail. While certain parts were a bit too exhaustive in my opinion (maybe it's also because I was listening to the audiobook? Hearing some of the details over and over again did get a bit tiring towards the end), it did feel very realistic, like you really were there in the middle of Dublin watching all this play out.

Conway was a fantastic character. You rarely see female characters like her that are allowed to be aggressive and blunt and over all very three dimensional. She absolutely felt like a person, and that's how you know she's a really well written character. Her whole lone wolf mentality did get annoying for a bit, but the ending addresses it and 
I liked that she realised it wasn't her against the world, and that a lot of the hatred she believed people around her felt for her was in her head (without dismissing what it is like for a WOC in such an environment), which honestly thrilled me. Also extra points for her being a WOC! Woot!

The investigation itself... it was satisfyingly done towards the end, even though it dragged in the middle. My biggest issue was that 
it seemed obvious to me from the moment they began suspecting that Breslin or McCann were bent and working for gangsters, that they should cut out the gangster theory which had no basis on anything and see if the cops had a direct connection to the victim. Essentially, a lot of stuff that seemed logical was put off for a long time while they chased half-baked theories . But again, all of that WAS acknowledged by the characters at the end and a reason was given for it, so that definitely made it better for me.

Anyway this is my first Tana French book and while I feel like it could have been a lot shorter, I definitely enjoyed it and am considering reading another one of her books soon."
"This book was read for my Reading Challenge Around the World in 80+ Books

I’ve read more than half of Tana French’s atmospheric mysteries following the Dublin Murder Squad. And I continue to have a love hate relationship with her books. After In the Woods, I vowed to never read one of her books again, I just hated the ending. I went back for more with Faithful Place, and was again disappointed. But The Secret Place sunk it’s hooks into me and didn’t let it go. It was fabulous. So when The Trespasser released to glowing reviews, I gave French another try. And I could not put this book down. However, as much as I liked the story of The Trespasser, I continue to equally dislike French’s writing style. I despise reading dialect, so I tried an audio version of this book, because I don’t mind listening to fun accents & local slang. But it still drove me up a wall. If French could write a mystery with half the Irish slang, I’d probably like it twice as much. But alas, I continue going back to her stories, because she is a gifted storyteller."
"Another really fine book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This time it's Antoinette Conway, a secondary protagonist in the last book (The Secret Place) who is the narrator and chief detective on the case -- a device French has used so far in all the books. I'm now puzzled as to who the protagonist will be in the next book (and I'm devoutly hoping there will be a next book).

As Conway and Stephen Moran, now her partner and also a member of the Murder Squad, are about to finish their night shift, they are called to the scene of a fatal beating. ""The Gaffer,"" head of the squad, assigns Det. Breslin to assist them, which doesn't please either Conway or Moran. Breslin is pushing them relentlessly to a quick solve with the man who was going to have dinner with the victim as the perpetrator -- but it doesn't seem quite right. What's his hidden agenda?

With looks into the past, Conway and Moran finally come up with an alternate solution, but it's one nobody wants. During the course of the investigation, Conway also has to deal with her feelings about the harassment she's endured since she joined the squad, and with her own not-always-reliable internal narrative. I've begun to realize that this last is a common theme throughout the series, and although I despise the phrase ""transcends the genre,"" I do believe that this unifying theme makes French's books more than a few hours' entertainment.

I listened to this as an audiobook, as I've done with all but the first in the series. I appreciate the books even more this way because of the various Irish accents that help the non-Irish reader catch the nuances of region and class. Highly recommended, in any format."
"First book I've read by Tana French and I liked it. The protagonist, Conway, is a bit irritating and difficult to like, but sympathetic nonetheless. The tone is good--serious but not too dark or heavy. The plot did keep me guessing a bit. My one beef is it was too long and drawn out. At 600 pages it could easily have lost 100 and been fine. I'll probably read another by the same author though. "
"This book was the choice of my book club--I'd never heard of Tana French and decided this time NOT to do any ""googling"" prior to reading it. So it wasn't until I finished the book yesterday that I went online to learn more about the Dublin Murder Squad series and discovered this is actually the sixth book. This New Yorker article does an excellent job of commentary on the series:

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...
""Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series presents its readers with a portrait of contemporary Ireland. French, an American who has lived in Ireland for twenty-six years, chooses locations where her characters get pinched between the desire to cling to history and the urge to jettison it for brighter horizons.... Yet, however convincing and well observed French’s Ireland feels, it isn’t the kernel of her work’s appeal, the thing that makes the Dublin Murder Squad series the object of an intense, even cultic fascination.... Most crime fiction is diverting; French’s is consuming. A bit of the spell it casts can be attributed to the genre’s usual devices—the tempting conundrum, the red herrings, the slices of low and high life—but French is also hunting bigger game. In her books, the search for the killer becomes entangled with a search for self. In most crime fiction, the central mystery is: Who is the murderer? In French’s novels, it’s: Who is the detective?....Each novel in French’s series is narrated by a different detective, someone who appears as a supporting character in an earlier book. The view that the narrator of the previous novel has of another detective is often revealed to be significantly skewed when that detective gets to tell his or her own story.""

The protagonist, Antoinette Conway, is a great character--since this is a first person novel, she is the only one I really felt I came to ""know"". And immediately I cast Rosario Dawson in the part: ""Her mother, Isabel Celeste, of Puerto Rican and Afro-Cuban descent, is a singer, and her stepfather, who raised her, Greg Dawson, of Irish descent, is a construction laborer."" http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206257/bi... Conway's antagonism toward her squad is based primarily on their treatment of her as a woman, but her dark skin also sets her apart. Throughout the book, she's on the edge of exploding, with her partner, Stephen Moran, as the only person she trusts. (I cast Domhnall Gleeson in this part.) I have to say this book kept me reading--and toward the end, I couldn't put it down, as the reveal of the murderer had the inevitability of the last down slope of a roller coaster.

Some of Conway's lines had me chuckling; here is her description of the murder scene:
""...the room looks like it was bought through some Decorate Your Home app where you plug in your budget and your favorite colors and the whole thing arrives in a van the next day.""

And since I play a fantasy video game with my grandchildren, her description of a suspect tickled me:
""Rory looks like the kind of guy who thinks the good bit of a video game is when you're exploring the terrain and admiring the state-of-the-art graphics, before you get to the crude part where you have to blow the baddies away."" Later, she offers this about Rory: ""This guy couldn't order a sandwich without tying himself in knots about the possible consequences of mayonnaise."" And again, this one about him had me laughing out loud: ""I'm amazed this guy manages to get out of bed in the morning without working himself into a panic attach over the chance that he might trip on the bath mat and stab himself through the eye socket with his toothbrush and be left with a permanent twitch that'll ruin his chances of landing an airplane safely if the pilot has a heart attack and doom hundreds to a fiery death. What-if-maybe crap is for weak people.""

So later, when her long absent father shows up, she rejects him--even though a piece of her desperately wants her own ""what-if-maybe"" questions answered.""I see my tilting like a hawk high in warm air, while below me he unrolls all my might-have-beens, for me to circle above at my leisure till every fork and tributary is stamped into my mind, reclaimed and mine. I see him opening his cloak to show me all the lost pages of my story written in silver on the night-sky lining.""

The stories we tell ourselves and then inflict on others is really at the core of this book's heart--and toward the end, Conway is watching people go by and says:
""Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of a person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.""

The NY Times says:
""Starting in 2007 with In the Woods, which won an Edgar Award and a slew of other prizes, all of French’s novels have been international bestsellers. The books have achieved this success because they’re unfailingly intelligent and beautifully written, and because they are never lurid — there’s little sex or gratuitous gore in them. Their magic lies less in the crimes themselves than in the distinct new worlds French creates to showcase each of them.""

The first two books of the series, In the Woods and The Likeness, are being made into an eight part BBC series:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/late...
""BBC One announces that Sarah Phelps, who has most recently reimagined the Agatha Christie novels, is next turning her attention to the writing of Dublin’s leading crime novelist Tana French, penning The Dublin Murders.""

Think it's time I read those two :-)"
"Tana French is by far the best crime fiction writer of our time. Her characters are memorable mainly because almost none of them are single-dimensional. Rather, almost all of them are so very different from each other that one marvels at the author's ability to invent so many types of human psyche. They all seem to have their own ghosts wandering around them perpetually. The stories have haunting backdrops. Most importantly, readers never feel cheated when mysteries unravel. One gets the viewpoint of the main investigators and learns along with, generally fairly smartly.

All this is true in the sixth episode as well but something is slightly amiss by the author's elevated standards. May be the main murder is too prosaic compared to the gore of the Broken Harbour. Or may be the characters are too few and too simple compared to the psychological extremes probed in the Secret Place. There is nothing as smart as the copycat of the Likeness or otherworldly as In the Woods.

The Trespasser, like each of the previous novel, builds slowly and beautifully. The language is impeccable. One falls in love with the characters as the story moves forward. The book is particularly engaging in the second half while the first half seems to meander with rather long interview passages that serve no purpose. Overall, still a good book but not that is likely to make to most people's top-3 of Tana French."
"A tough and bitter Irish detective, Antoinette Conway, powers through a murder case in the hopes of getting some leverage for herself and her career. Armed with her red-headed, young, and lighthearted partner Steve Moran, she finds holes in the main suspect's story about how the pretty and elusive Aislinn Murray died, and sets them off into a week-long quest for answers.

It was not as literary as others in the series. The first quarter of it was far too slow moving. And, to be honest, a good many of the conversations with witnesses and suspects should have been cut in half -- no one talks that much! However, the quality of character development and sheer heft of Tana French's novels really can't be denied: she is simply a very good writer.

A shiny bit at the end was when their boss let the perp admit to what he did by guiding him ""back into being himself,"" rather than the way Antoinette and Steve had tried to strong-arm him into being a ""murderer."" It was an authentic moment, showing the detectives weren't superheroes and still had a lot to learn.

Also, there was also a lovely nuance threaded through the entire book about being a woman in this man's world of the Murder Squad, and about how Antoinette thinks everyone is against her -- and how she's fighting every day to combat it all -- and then she realizes they (all) actually aren't. It gave way to a welcome and deftly applied a tilt in her attitude."
"The Trespasser, Tara French, author; Hilda Fay, narrator
From the first page, the book holds the reader in thrall. Antoinette Conway is a young, angry detective working for the Dublin Murder Squad. Although she really wanted the job, she has a chip on her shoulder and a persecution complex about the way the other members of the team treat her. Still, she has the makings of a really good detective, if given a fair opportunity. She works with her partner, Steve (another newbie like she is); he is one of the few male detectives not engaged in harassing her periodically, often in heinous ways. Antoinette has a tongue that is often vicious and crude in its attacks on fellow workers, and she has a temper to go along with it that seems in desperate need of being curbed.
When a young, beautiful woman, Aislinn Murray, is discovered brutally murdered in her own home, Antoinette and Steve are assigned the task of solving the crime. They are also asked to work with a more experienced and rather arrogant detective named Breslin. He has decided it is a case of domestic violence and is dead set on solving this crime quickly so he can get back to his more important cases. Their prime suspect turns out to be the victim’s new beau, Rory Fallon, who had a dinner date with her on the night she was murdered.
As the story investigates all of the people involved, the victim, her friend and family, the suspects and their backgrounds, the methods, motives and tactics of the police and journalists play a powerful role in the process. The picture painted of them is not pretty. The one seems intent on solving the crime, regardless of innocence or guilt and the other on promoting scandalous publicity for their own personal gain. Residents and politicians scream for a quick solution so they can go back to their normal lives. They seem to care little for the lives wrecked by the investigation which often attacks and implicates innocent people. The methods used by all investigators, journalists and concerned citizens seem more like blackmail than an honest attempt to solve the crime and put the criminal away. Everyone seems to have some kind of an agenda.
I was disappointed in the way Antoinette was portrayed. I was not sure why the color of her skin was emphasized. It seemed to play no pertinent role in the story. Also, I was disappointed that she was portrayed so vehemently as such a hard-nosed woman with a filthy mouth and a chip on her shoulder that she kept challenging others to knock off. She leapt to the nastiest conclusions and was overly judgmental. Her own personality bled into every action she took, rather than her skill as a detective taking precedence. She always felt the need to prove herself and her past behavior had left ugly rumors in their wake which others judged her by, even though some were often untrue and/or exaggerated. Her overly defensive behavior lent them credence. I would love to read a book about a female without baggage, one who achieves success, regardless of her race, religion or background, because she is skilled and worthy of respect from the get-go.
The book, I thought sadly, seemed to point to a society of crooked cops that gathered round to protect, each other even when innocent victims paid the price for their fellow officer’s crimes. Those officers and citizens brave enough to give evidence against the “bent” detectives were afraid that exposing them would negatively affect their own futures. They were often threatened with harassment and persecution. They would be shunned and maybe even injured. Their careers would be over. Journalists were portrayed as bloodthirsty cretins searching for a byline at any cost to those they smeared. Judging from the way news is covered today, this depiction may be closer to the truth than fiction!
The coincidence of the detective, Antoinette, and the victim, Aislinn, having been abandoned by their fathers worked well in the story. The knowledge of that connection allowed Antoinette to see herself more honestly and perhaps to mature and deal with others, and herself, more fairly. I found it interesting to watch Antoinette morph into someone who finally showed a bit of humility and introspection at the same time as the case also went from one that jumped to conclusions to one that was more interested in the truth. The two, the detective on a personal level, and the police on the criminal level of the investigation, seemed to work out the problem of ethics and the honest search for a solution, concurrently. As the story was revealed, both the detective and the squad were faced with the same dilemma of searching for answers, not creating them. How they each approached it was what made the story most interesting to me. Instead of looking for and relying on circumstantial evidence of crimes committed against herself personally in the squad room, and the crime committed against Aislinn, Antoinette and the detectives were forced to stop taking the easy way out, jumping to conclusions, often false, and instead were forced to deal with hard facts to reach the ultimate conclusion and solve the crime.
Although the language was over the top crude, there was no gratuitous sex to titillate readers. The story itself was the total draw! Although it was a bit longer than necessary, perhaps overly detailed at times, it was an interesting study of interrogation methods, criminal behavior and society’s ills when it comes to family, values, policing, and news coverage. The affects of all these patterns was exposed and would make for interesting and thought provoking discussions in a book group.
Some book group questions
1-Because the issue between Antoinette and her missing dad are not cleared up, do you think there will be a sequel?
2-Has the author left any clues about her next book?
3-What are the similarities between Antoinette and Aislinn? (the “d” and the “vic”)
4-What are the similarities between the prime suspect and a cop on the case? (Rory and McCann)
5-How did Antoinette react to her hidden anger and pain?
6-How did Aislinn react to her hidden anger and pain?
7-How did Rory react when he was dumped?
8-What were some similarities between Rory and McCann when it came to self-esteem?
9-Why were Rory and McCann so surprised that someone beautiful would care about them?
10-What kinds of feelings did the book promote about the police and journalists relationships?
11-What kind of feelings did you get about the police tactics and journalist’s behavior?
12-Did you like or dislike any of the characters?

"A fine police procedural. My first book by Tana French, not the last. The lead character (don't know if she shows up again) is Conway, a tough female detective, and a great, though somewhat pained and painful personality. She gives no quarter and expects none. She is disliked, it seems, by virtually all the other D's (as she calls them) in her group - clearly partly because she is at the moment, the only woman, partly because being friendly is not really in her DNA. The marvel of the book is that with just a few bits of action, it's a thriller that plays out almost entirely in conversation, particularly some dramatic interviews with suspects, between Conway and her partner, Steve, and with the key witness. The murder victim also morphs into something very different than we expected... All finely honed characters - the plot line has you befuddled as to how it will turn out, as one apparent story line after another is confused and, to use her term, bollixed up. The investigation unfolds with an obvious suspect for whom guilt is all but obvious, and a snaky but polished detective constantly pushing to wrap up the case, but facts nag at Conway and Steve, they start susceptive the other D, but it's D's partner who he's sworn to protect, who had had much earlier screwed up the victim's family, and she had woven a plot to get him to fall madly in love with her, and then dump him for revenge. Worked beautifully, except that he lost it and smacked her, it turned out fatally..."
"Tana French is basically the only mystery/crime/detective writer I read and this one certainly didn’t disappoint. In addition to just a plain great who-done-it there are interesting musings on how we become who we are, the way we move through the world, and how people interact with one other. How we want to be seen, or not seen. Great feminist themes woven through as well, all without too heavy a hand."
"Tana French is back! After the last few weaker Dublin Murder Squad books, The Trespasser approaches the level of In the Woods and The Likeness. Enough said."

Received from the publisher, for free, for review consideration. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.

I’d had Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series on my TBR for some time. I keep hearing that they’re great mysteries/thrillers, which I love. While The Trespasser is the sixth book in that series, I was able to read and enjoy it without having read the others (although I’ve seen suggestions that you really should read them in order so oops).

I really enjoyed this book! I loved the story and the twisty mystery, but more than that, I really liked Detective Antoinette Conway. She’s tough and determined not to appear vulnerable to anyone on her squad, and the squad seems pretty intent on making her job as difficult as possible by constantly harassing her. Or maybe not? Is it all in her head or are the other detectives on her squad out to get her, trying to get her to fail? I loved that I wasn’t entirely certain what was going on both in terms of the mystery and Conway’s paranoia.

Tana French is an excellent writer. I couldn’t put this book down and I will definitely be checking out the rest of the series (in order). Recommended!"
"I was tempted to do only 3 stars, but that is really grading on a curve because I liked the book a lot...just not as much as her previous books. Partly my bad for remembering surprisingly little about the POV character in this book, so I wasn't as invested as I normally am in this series right off the bat. Even after re-acquainting myself, she's not my favorite POV French has used.

Clever mystery and, as always with French, really great, suspenseful writing. I loved the story-telling theme, which was everywhere in the book without being in your face. I loved the truth of it and how it just kept coming around and around. I loved how the POV character was aware of how stories so often feel true to the teller, even when they are not. I loved how that awareness didn't prevent her from doing the same thing in her own life. What I loved less about the theme was that it resulted in the action in this one happening almost exclusively via story-telling. Again, very cool use of the theme, but I'd have liked to spend less time literally sitting around listening to people talk about what happened and more time discovering it.

All that said, if you like this series, you'll like this book a lot."
"The Trespasser has really been an arduous read for me. I love Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad series but wow this book was uphill all the way. Let's break it down. The Good: as always the mystery is a fine one. I am almost certain there will be several points in this book, Constant Reader, in which you will think you know who the Big Bad is-you'll be wrong. French plays fair as always and scrupulously provides all the clues, but she is very good at misdirection. The Bad: This book takes forever to build any type of momentum-if this had been the first book I had read by French I would have quit. The Ugly: Though I like the literary device of changing narrators for each novel it has really worn thin, especially as no matter which character is telling the story they are beginning to sound very much alike. I did not detect all that much difference between the ""voice"" of Antoinette Conway and, say, ""Scorcher"" Kennedy from a previous book. The Exquisite: the payoff at the end. French ties all the knots into a pretty bow and resolves everything in an emotionally satisfying way. This is not nearly as good as Into the Woods, sadly, but we didn't give up on Stephen King after Salem's Lot either. "
"Time after time it's left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside from life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.""

I really liked Moran from The Secret Place, so it was great to see him back again and paired with Conway for this book. And to have the book be from Conway's POV.

I LOVED Conway. She was prickly, tough as nails, professional and driven. She was a, for lack of a better term, a hardass. She was GREAT. She and Moran complemented each other so well. Moran was the good boy who could make the people they were questioning talk because he made them feel comfortable. He was able to steer stories. Conway knew how people worked, and she was able to keep things from veering off track. I loved how well they knew each other and worked in tandem to get the stories from all the people involved in the case.

Basically this story is about obsession and revenge but it is a lot more quiet than that. It looks at how much you would commit to revenge and so I really liked that. I thought the ending and the mystery behind the murder was satisfying and I loved watching Conway and Moran work together to unravel it."
"For some reason I jumped from the first Dublin Murder Squad mystery to the sixth and most recent. But this laid to rest any qualms about red herrings and unresolved plot lines that I had with Tana French's series (now I'm thinking she may have left readers significant clues about who committed the long-unsolved murders that frame the narrative in #1). None of that nonsense here. This murder is more than solved. All outstanding issues are satisfactorily resolved. And what I'm realizing about French is that it's not just who dunnit that intrigues, but the sorry psychological state of the lead detective, in this case a tough Irishwoman who came up rough and is now being sexually harassed in her squad, for detectives a place that should be the source of unqualified support. Part of the suspense derives from this broken person trying to do a good job in the fraught circumstances of a murder investigation. The narrative voice of this novel is consistently street-Irish. And our lead detective is blunt, unsentimental, a bit of a bitch. Her increasingly bleak and paranoid worldview seems all too plausible -- and all too easy to relate to. I scooped it up like a turtle sundae with extra pecans."
"Alright Tana French, you've finally hooked me. I know people love her, but I've found several of her premises to be too far from believable to really hook me (In the Woods being the worst offender) and I never felt particularly attached to any of the characters. But the Trespasser is far and away my favorite book by her and has me committed to stick with anything else she writes. Although this is billed as part of a series, each book stands pretty well on its own, and many have completely different cast of characters (although all set in Dublin in the same homicide department). So if you're new to French, I would start with this one. Detective Conway is a woman, new-ish to the homicide department, but facing a great deal of sexism and outright antagonism. She (along with her partner Det Moran-- the most likable guy in the world) are assigned what seems to be an open and shut domestic murder case, except the degree of scrutiny and pressure they are under to go ahead and wrap the case up make them suspicious. From there, this is just a really compelling whodunit with some subplots about gender dynamics in a police department and parent-child relationships. The second half drags a bit, but definitely my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books. "
"Finally finished all the Dublin ""murder squad"" books. Each book is narrated by a different detective and the narrator of one book is usually a major or minor character in a previous book. When the character resurfaces as a narrator it creates a subtle link to the other stories, but each book does work on its own. No need to read them in sequence if you don't want to...

The Trespasser was good, but not my favorite. Perhaps because Detective Conway is a bit of a whiny and paranoid narrator. I found In The Woods and The Likeness to be the most suspenseful and The Likeness and Faithful Place to have the best narrators. Broken Harbor and The Secret Place show off Tana French's evocative writing. Read 'em all!"
"I love Tana French's writing, especially her dialogue. When her characters speak to each other, they speak as real people. Even when the purpose of the dialogue is move the plot along or fill in a blank space, it is never overly expository. The only reason I did not give The Trespasser 5 stars is that the plot required me to accept one too many coincidences. But, to be sure, that it the problem with the mystery genre. Most crimes are committed by stupid people with no real motivation other than obtain property, get high or settle scores, and usually the only people that know or care about the victims are the victims' families. But who wants to read about that? We want to read about intricately plotted, decades in the making crimes committed by interesting people on interesting victims. And we want the people who solve those crimes to be interesting too. Given those marching orders, Tana French does a marvelous job. This one is perhaps not as good as Faithful Place, but close. Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are likeable enough, but also flawed enough to come across as real enough.
"
"I really couldn't like this book quite as much as I wanted to. It was still brilliant, but it had a bit of a different feel to it than the other books in the series. This is the first of the Dublin Murder Squad books to really take place mailnly inside the squadroom. The mystery is also a straight hit from start to finish, with most of the information being delivered through interveiws and interrogations rather than in flashbacks. A much more linear flow and smaller setting than any of the other books. Its a decent enough whodunit mystery but it's really the theme of the story that is just brilliant. People's imaginary version of their world versus relality and how it can be devestating when they meet. Sometimes its like a splash of cold water and other times it can be like high speed collision that nobody sees coming because they are too caught up in their fantasy world. Actually, now that I'm really thinking about it maybe I liked The Tresspasser more than I thought. Thats the thing about the Dublin Murder Squad books. They are beautiful and haunting and keep you thinking long after you've finished reading them."
"Four+ stars for Tana French's writing that continues to show a remarkable breadth and variety in tone, characterization and substance. In this book she is restrained in her descriptive passages and they are a joy to read, whatever the context. The protagonist, Detective Garda Antoinette Conway, describes her emotional landscape after completing a wrenching murder case: ""A big solve does that to you, leaves the world scoured dawn-white, sand-white, empty except for the solve smooth and heavy as a deep-dived rock in your hand.""

Sadly, this character is a challenge for me. Her dark, grim, self-obsessed view of life is tough to live with for 450 pages. Yes, she develops and grows by the end of the book, but do I care? Not really. I give her two stars. And a pivotal character who puts in a cameo performance in one key scene - really? - that's one-star plotting.

Not one of my favourite French mystery novels. But I still look forward to her next book. And hope the New Yorker review will encourage even more devoted readers."
"This was a fun read that got my heart beating fast at all the right moments but did not make my skin crawl with unbearable anticipation. It found the sweet spot between enough action to keep you intrigued, but not so intense that all I wanted to do was speed to the end and be done with it.

Our protagonist Antoinette is feisty and brave, if not a little too inside her own head. She approaches being the outcast of the murder unit with anger and fervor, which doesn't win her many friends. But as Antoinette works with her cheery and upbeat partner, Steve, you see her stretch to her full potential as a detective and learn about herself.

This book made me wish I was as adept at reading people as a murder detective is. It was fun to hear Antoinette detail her thoughts on a very minute aspect of a suspect's response, to the point where much of her investigation was comprised on understanding people compared to solid facts. Very cool!"
"Another great installment from the Dublin Murder Squad series. I love how each book follows a different detective or pair of detectives. The main character, Antoinette, is having issues fitting in and is paranoid that the rest of the fellas are out to get her. She and her partner are embroiled in an investigation that should be a simple domestic fight gone bad, but it seems to be leading them down a dark path that will put them on the outs with the rest of the squad even more than they are. It's a well plotted story that has twists that you will see and some that you won't coupled with well fleshed out characters that you will either love or hate to really bring the story to life! While you could absolutely read this as a stand alone book without being lost, I would highly recommend that you start with the first book in the series and work your way up to this book. Trust me, if you like a good mystery, this murder squad series will not let you down. "
"4.5*

Tana French is an amazing author. I've blown through all of her Dublin Murder Squad books in the last few months and every one has been great reading. The last book, Secret Place, was my least favorite but this one more than made up for it. I run across so many authors where I really like the first book and then the second is okay, but the plot seems like a rehashing of the first. But Tana French makes each book, each narrator, each mystery totally different. The books all even have different feels... this one was solid police procedural, all about the job, The Likeness felt more like a character drama, In The Woods was a childhood trauma story. If the murder squad and some characters weren't overlapped in each book, they could even seem like they were written by different authors. And every book is solid, the characters, the story, the mystery, none of is flimsy. I'm bummed that there probably won't be another for awhile."
"Tana French is quickly becoming a Harlan Coben in that I can snatch up any book with her name on it and be pretty certain I'm going to like it. Now considering this in only my second French novel, it makes that first statement kind of a big deal.

The Trespasser is a solid police procedural written with a grace uncommon in the genre. The flowery prose doesn't dampen the horror of the crimes, if anything, the horror is highlighted against it. This would be a novel to gently ease a gore-sensitive reader into this type of crime fiction because yes, it is absolutely bloody and violent but the language which paints the picture is beautiful enough you almost don't notice.

All of the characters fit their role perfectly, with just the right information given out at a time. Main characters, secondary and even the swiftly mentioned ""extras"" have their precise place in the narrative and that is a delicate balance to achieve."
"
This is a consolidated review of the six books in Dublin Murder Squad series.

Tana French’s debut book and the first in this loosely bound series, ‘In the Woods’, opens with as lyrical line as any found in literary classics. She asks you to imagine a summer evening and just like that she has my attention and my breath.

All the six books are set in Ireland and it is a very different Ireland than what Nora Roberts writes about. If Roberts’ is all verdant, magical romance, where even deadly evil is something out of fairytales, French’s Ireland is real, full of grit under your shoes, twisty bends and turns of dark, desperate human mind. The first book as explained by the title has a bucolic setting, one you would expect to be charming, even though it is scene of a murder recently and the unsolved disappearance of children two decades ago (nearly reminiscent of grisly Grimm stories). The books reek of despair, helpless foibles of human ambition and sometimes, just sometimes that sliver of hope.

The first book opens with diappearance of two children into woods that they knew as back of their hands and the third who returns with memory lost and blood filled shoes. The children are the sprites of wood and you almost believe that some unnamed monster has them captive and they might return someday, half savage, tortured monsters themselves. They hace receded into cold case file, until a fresh murder of snother child brings memories tumbling back for the third child, who is now the lead murder detective on the new case. As the book progresses, you wonder if something sinister truly hides in the wood and what makes a murderer.

In fact, what makes a murderer is a running theme in all the books.

The second book is a poetic exploration of the gossamer web of friendship. ‘The Likeness’ is probably the weakest and most dreamy of all the six books in terms of plot but even so, I felt like I was watching some beautiful, warm painting - I was on the outside craving the warmth of that portrait, the match girl wishing for the idyll despite the fact that there was something broken, not quite rotten, spreading through its fabric. It opens with the murder of a girl, with uncanny resemblance to Cassie, the ex-partner and ex-best friend to Adam / Robert, the protagonist from Book One. The key to murder lies in the ramshackle house and the close knit friendship that the dead girl shared with four others. A friendship that transcends family. Cassie goes undercover and finds herself unable to separate reality from friendship, yearning for the same warmth that the match girl wanted.

‘The Faithful Place’, the third book is perhaps the most personal. Frank Mackey, Cassie’s mentor and boss from previous book, is a reluctant prodigal son, drawn by new clues in the disappearance of his one true love twenty years ago on the night they were supposed to elope together. For decades, he has thought that Rosie decided to leave him behind - that betrayal is what started him down the path of cop-hood - but now he has to reassess what he has believed about Rosie, his old family and his new family, with ex-wife and daughter.

This book reveals the dregs of Dublin’s working class, their lives and squabbles, contrasring it with the posh sussuration of Mackey’s ex-wife, Olivia.

Fourth is ‘Broken Harbour’, with Kennedy, Mackey’s frenemy on the police force as the lead detective in the gruesome murder of a young family - husband and two children while the wife fights death in hospital. This one explores the slow, inevitable impact of an economic recession. In some ways, it is not different from drug addiction - the high of excess money and the sheer desolation of no income. With Kennedy is Richie, the greenhorn on the murder squad, whom Kennedy is showing the ropes as senior partner. The conversations between Richie and Kennedy reveal as much about the mystery as about the detectives own morality.

Fifth book, ‘Secret Place’ sees the return of Mackey family through Holly, Frank’s daughter, who is now sixteen and studying in the iconic girls’ school, St. Kilda’s with her three best friends and people of interest in the year old murder of Chris Harper, student of neighbouring boys’s school. Once more the theme of friendship and how far would you go for it dominates, with all the drama and muck of a teen show but with unexpected depths. In this book, French uses the alternating timeline device - one leading up to Chris Harper’s murder an year earlier and the second of the single day in the present which unravels the mystery. A day which begins with Holly Mackey bringing Stephen Moran, returning rookie cop from ‘Faithful Place’, a postcard whose writer claiming to know the identity of Chris’ murderer.

The final book is about Antoinette Conway, the sole female on the murder squad, and partner to Moran who has been promoted to Murder from Cold Cases. She is struggling with blatant chauvinism and misogyny at work, extreme form of ragging which she refuses to back down from but is reaching the end of her tether after two years. She and Moran are handed what seems like a simple case of domestic violence - a young woman murdered ostensibly by a boyfriend.

This is the most convoluted of the six books - simple and straightforward to begin with, then tying itself in paranoid knots of Conway’s exhausted psyche before revealing a clear path to the centre.

In all the six books, French uses the first person narrative. Each book has different narrator but despite first person, French is able to give them distinct voices and vocabulary, their thoughts and expressions would not be considered interchangeable. The writing is beautiful, plot is character driven and though the mysteries are not particularly strong, it is the insight into the human mind and motive that keeps you turning the pages.

Absolutely fascinating."
"Tana French is consistently excellent. And does a great job with keeping a similar tone and method/depth of creating & revealing character while telling very different stories in each book. And I really enjoy hopping into the POV of a character you've previously seen through other eyes. I usually expect to be annoyed at leaving a character I know & like but have enjoyed each book enough that by now I trust her process. And this book had a good bit of confusing you as to what exactly happened without feeling like it resorted to obvious misdirection. This story felt smaller scale & more internal than others in the series, which was interesting after the last one, which was the most expansive and the only book that switched between characters POVs. It was nice reading those two in order. Can't wait for more by her."
"I enjoyed this Irish murder mystery and learned some Irish slang in the deal. I would have enjoyed it more, however, had it been more tightly written and edited. At times, one got the feeling the author was paid by the word and was going for a big paycheck by belaboring the protagonist's alienation to death. I pretty quickly got that she was alienated and generally in a foul mood about everything. I didn't need this to be reinforced on every other page as she ranted about each development in the case and her interactions with others. Here, less would definitely have been more. Don't let this put you off from reading what was still a very enjoyable and clever book with some good twists and turns in the plot. Just be forewarned that you will have to slog through some significant literary chaff to get to the wheat of the story."
"I devour French's books and this one was no different. I truly enjoyed having Steven Moran and Antoinette Conway back for this case. Tana French hasn't yet had the same team for two books ---so this was a first that I'm happy about. This time the story is from Conway's perspective--- a voice that rings true to the character we met in The Secret Place. Once again, French keeps you guessing as to who the murderer is and this time you have to keep guessing as to the nature of the victim. Never before has an author stumped me so much when the murderer is sharing the pages with everyone else. Another great job of storytelling, poetic pulls, and imagery. More than a good mystery writer, she is simply a fine user of words. My only regret is that now I'm finished with all the books of the Dublin Murder Squad and have to wait around to see what she creates next. "
"Tana French continues to blow my mind with her great characters and complex plots. I read this over two days while on a short vacation - I kept trying to sneak reading time and finally had to tell my family to leave me alone while I read the last hundred pages. Then when I was finished I just had to wander around in a daze for a bit. Know what I mean about a book hangover?

These are gritty crime novels. There is lots of language, way more than I'm usually comfortable with. No graphic sex, but plenty of vulgar sex talk. I'm sure I've rejected other books because there was just too much, but these are worth the discomfort to me

2021: Needed an audiobook for walking so I went through this one again. The narrator was fantastic and I was reminded of a few things I'd forgotten in the story. Still a great book."
"So now that I've finished the series, I think I'm supposed to rank the books in order of liking. Here's my list:

In the Woods
Faithful Place
The Likeness
The Secret Place
The Trespasser
Broken Harbor

Character ranking (a tie): Cassie Maddox, Frank Mackey, Antoinette Conway

I kind of ripped through this series (have I mentioned that I love series?) and only wish there were more. I love/hate the feeling you get when you finish something you love and need to find something else to fill the space.

French's strength is character development and the subtle ways we impose ourselves on the world. The plots were sometimes fantastical, which I didn't mind because they served the characters and moved the real narrative of their demons and, in some cases, their evolution or downfall.

Can't wait for the next one!

"
"4.5 stars

The Trespasser by Tina French is the last book (so far) in the author’s Dublin Murder Squad. Each book is a great story, but also like a special trip to Dublin. The audio-books are superb because they are narrated in the most beautiful Irish brogue. It feels like I’m listening to this story right there in Dublin.

The “trespasser” in the story refers to a clue within this intricately plotted mystery. The disaster is a family – mom, dad and two children – are all dead in their home, with the exception of the mom who is barely alive. This is definitely a huge “whodunnit” because the detectives – and this reader – are forced to suspect every person in the story except the two little children. Tana French is truly an excellent writer, not just a great mystery writer. She’s well worth reading, even if you’re not a mystery fan."
"A definite slow burner, don't expect any chase scenes though readers of Tana French probably won't. Procedural detective story, this one focuses on rookie partners trying to tie up what looks like a domestic violence murder. The female detective is facing a particularly hostile work environment which influences her ability to work the case as it should be. Her paranoia spills into the case and her daily life, she's an unreliable narrator and we're along for her head trip. I always enjoy French's ability to capture what I imagine working a murder case is like, lots of paperwork and researching dead ends and manipulative witness interrogations. The ending was quite tidy, something she often doesn't give us. "
"I'm not a die-hard Tana French fan but I've always thought I should be. Her books contain everything I like. I got sucked into this story right from the beginning. Since I'm not a follower of this series there were probably bits I didn't completely grasp but I did pick up on some snarky comments by Conway, the strong partnership between Conway and Moran, and some emotional baggage that makes the lead character more interesting.

Perhaps I liked this one more than others because its focus was inside the police department rather than outside. I was anxious to figure out who could be trusted and how the case was going to be sorted out.

This book worked fine as a stand alone for me. However, it did make me want to go back and fill in the gaps in this series."
I like French's novels because the are solid mysteries focused more on character development than plot. I didn't like The Secret Place as much as her other books and am glad to see her hit this one out of the park. A lot of this story focuses on the stories we tell ourselves and how we always think of ourselves as the good guy and the main character. There are so many different ways to look at one event or one person. A detective's job often involves sifting through these stories trying to find the right one. But even detectives gave their own stories and biases. I really enjoyed this one although I think it could have done with a bit of editing - it got a little repetitive about a third of the way through before taking off again.
"I love these books and this was a good one. I thought I'd warm up to her choice of narrator, but Conway is as hard in her head as she is from Moran's perspective. But we still get Moran, which is great. Also great is the mystery and how it bleeds out and infects everything. The ending is fantastic, a bang that is soft and quiet, morphing anger into sadness as you hold your breath to not break the spell. But the best part of it is what is says about stories, the stories we tell ourselves, the stories we live in, and how prominent a character we are in them. This, especially coming from Tana French, who switches narrators and thus her characters places in her stories, had me thinking about this book long after I'd finished reading it."
"This is my second Tana French book. I liked this one much better.

French has solid, interesting stories with some nice twists. It seems to me though that sometimes the stories slow down because the author includes a lot of side details about events or personal stories of characters that don’t really give a lot of extra to the plot and just seems to detract from the main focus.

Almost like she stops to take the time to describe things that aren’t needed just so that the story will take longer to unwind. Or so that you’ll have a better understanding of that character. Which normally I appreciate in books but the way this author does this it just goes on and on for me.

This was an audiobook version. I really liked the reader. She did a great job of separating the characters."
"Aft er I finished In the Woods, I was devastated to learn that each of French's Murder Squad installments relies on a new detective to carry on. But it works, and with the exception of Broken Harbor's Mick Kennedy, I liked all of them. Good mysteries, a great sense of place, and heavily character driven, all important parts of the equation for me. All have just a wisp of magical realism injected. And if you're heavy into having everything neatly wrapped and tied at the end, you may not be happy here. But you'll be missing out on some finely written mysteries if you don't give these a try. That said, this one seemed a little tired, too repetitious, and while I liked the characters (as always), I feel like French may have let Detective Conway down a bit. "
"While I was reading The Trespasser, I spent a lot of time thinking about how it was written. But by three-quarters of the way through I figured out that this was the only way to successfully tell this story. At first it felt like too much bitching about the job and coworkers. But as it turns out that was the crux of the story.The main character, Detective Conway, spent most of the book coming to terms with the difference between the story in her head and reality. We all have to get over the idea that we are the center of the universe. That is something that we have to remind ourselves about frequently, not just once. It was a grand plot that, even when we knew the identity of the perp, we still had a rollercoaster ride waiting for us to see how it would be resolved."
"4.5. I love det. conway, aka our new narrator. like a lot. and i love the dynamic between her and moran. the story was decent and tana french as always STUNS with her ability to weave a narrative and a sentence together. i want more tho

i'm too close to it bc i just finished but it's up there w the tops of this series. don't know if the case was as ~special as the main characters were for me but yea. i don't know if anything will beat the secret place in my eyes for /obvious/ reasons but i certainly enjoyed this det. duo more maybe even the most since the 1st w/ ryan and cassie, maybe even more... probably more."
"Wow. What an interesting read. Tana French just gets better with each book in this series that she writes. Each of the Murder squad mysteries is a bit different. Different detectives from Murder Squad are featured in each novel. And all of the murders seem to have a connection in some way to the detectives assigned to the case. We get to see how the mysteries change and affect the detectives in a much more personal way than in most mystery novels. The Trespasser is no different.

"The Trespasser is actually the first book I've read in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. The lead character in this one is Antoinette Conway, a smart and sardonic detective. She has some issues with the guys on her squad, and I think women will relate to her struggles in a male-dominated field.

The secondary characters in this one are well developed, and the dialogue is excellent. I didn't guess the outcome way in advance of when the clues really start leading us to it, which is sometimes a problem I have with predictable books in this genre. I think The Trespasser works just fine as a standalone story, but I'll definitely be reading the other books in the series soon."
"I usually love Tana French with a 5/5 rating, but this one didn’t quite reach that. I found it wearisome spending so much time in the head of Antoinette Conway and the orbit of her partner Moran, unwelcome colleague Breslin, the prime suspect Rory, and various witnesses and squad room colleagues. Things picked up toward the end when the solution to the crime began to be revealed, and it was up to French’s high standards, but not enough to push this to a 5. I do wonder who will be the target of French’s next book, since none of Conway’s colleagues are likeable enough for me to want to spend any time with them. Maybe one of them has hidden qualities.
"
"I'm so glad Tana French wrote another in this series. She's become one of my favourite authors.
The Trespasser makes my top 3 in this group of 6.
The Likeness (book 2) is still my favourite, then the Secret Place (book 5), and now this one, which continues the partnership between Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway.
French combines compelling characters with a murder case that twists and turns. It's engaging throughout, which is nice after recently reading a few thrillers that either started out or ended flat. I really hope she writes another, it just sucks that if she does it likely won't be out for another two years."
"First read: Excellent, as always! My one complaint about past Tana French novels is that they go on just a little too long. Not so with The Trespasser, which gives you what you need and leaves some questions to keep you thinking.

Second read: This time around was a totally different read, which tends to happen with Tana French! The first read is all about the mystery, the second is all about the relationships. This time around, I really found myself feeling for Steve, who has to deal with Antoinette's negativity ALL THE TIME. She was a bit of a downer to be honest, but still a great read. I really with Tana French would write a novel featuring O'Kelly - there are layers there."
"another great installment in this series. i love how the author keeps switching POVs, and i can't wait to see who she picks next (my money is on breslin). this time she picked a badass, albeit slightly paranoid, single chick, so i was obvi a fan.

i agree that there's not a ton of action because you're hearing about everything via witness stories, but i prefer mysteries that follow the detective, so the reader learns information as they do. and i like that french doesn't throw in coincidental action that's way too convenient and not believable. these mysteries are solved with good old-fashioned detective work."
"I had such high expectations for this one, I couldn't help but feel a little bit disappointed that I didn't love it as much as the others. The writing is terrific of course, and I obviously love Conway and Moran, but the murder case itself just wasn't that compelling. I kept waiting for the plot to expand, and when that didn't happen I got a little antsy. The dark, mean place that is the Dublin murder squad is not where you want to feel claustrophobic. Well, perhaps the next installment will feature some happy and well-adjusted detectives in a respectful, healthy work environment. With Frank Mackay doing needlepoint. "
"Overall, I liked this book. I do like French, though I don't think any book has taught the greatness of the first in the series, a book I regularly feel like rereading. I still like the premise of having a different character narrate each book, and she does a great job of showing her characters vulnerabilities. I wish there was less fixation on characters as fantasists. I feel as though that is a recurring trope for secondary characters. I'll keep reading the series.

Odd for me, but this time I rated it 4 stars rather than 3. I heard the audio and it was powerful. Good book--Loved the growing self-awareness of the protag."
"This is definitely one of my favorites in this series (other favs: The Likeness and Faithful Place). It prompted a few eye-rolls with the metaphors and the tough guy/lady action, but was, overall, a solid mystery and engaging. My biggest issue with the series, and I do love Tana French, is that I feel like many of the characters have the same voice. Their personalities are tweaked but they all just blur together. Perhaps it's intentional and the squad are birds of feather, if you will, but it's something I've noticed with each novel. I'd like to reread the last book to compare Steve's perception of himself and those around him (mainly Antoinette) with this one."
"A well written policing story from Ireland. Antoinette has not just a chip on her shoulder..it is a huge plank. She has achieved her dream of being assigned to the Murder Squad, but finds she is unpopular in the previously all-male department and given only routine work instead of the detective work she longs to do. When a beautiful young woman is found dead in her house, the case is assigned to Antoinette and her partner, Steve Moran. There is a suspects, but Antoinette believes the case against him is not strong enough for arrest and charging and looks for other explanations of the event.
I thought the story is well paced and the characters believable. A good read."
"I like the gritty world of the Dublin Murder Squad. French knows how to construct a detective procedural. In this case, however, there might be too much time and effort spent debunking the red herrings. The actual resolution felt almost slap-dash compared to the detailed work put in on the dead ends. It takes a while, too, to get comfortable with the local vernacular that the author uses in dialog. It was difficult for my American ear to understand at times. But, French's detectives are always fascinating -- complicated, flawed, and very good at what they do. "
"I liked all these books so far, this one more than most. It struck me as different in two ways: first, while this is the only one in which the victim turns up in a literal locked room, the mystery itself goes a bit beyond the locked-room conceits of the others. And second, the story ends up having a lot less to say about some aspect of contemporary Ireland or other. I think Broken Harbor is still my favorite because the social dimension was so smartly integrated into the mystery. But that's not what this one's about, and that's ok, because the story is very good. "
"Tana French never disappoints. This is another Antoinette Conway story, but this time she's partnered with a young officer (seems like there was one where she had an older partner). Until the final chapters, it is not clear who she should trust or what truly happened in the murder case she and her partner--both low-level murder detectives--are investigating. Everything she seems to have gained purchase, the ground beneath her crumbles again. The psychological tensions are as interesting as the crime itself. Also, the Irish slang is just plain fun."
"I've swallowed whole each of Tana French's mysteries, but not The Trespasser--it was more of a slow chew for me. French's intricately plotted story moves slowly and takes patience to enjoy. But there is a payoff at the end that is worth the wait. I grew tired during the especially long police interrogations. But French draws each gesture, expression, and movement, and puts the reader in the scene. The dialogue is excellent, and the characters are unique and real, as they always are in French's novels. Tana French remains one of my favorite mystery authors."
"The book is very long, perhaps longer than it needs to be. At times I got mired in all the “if-then-maybes”. But what is good is the voice of the narrator which is sustained throughout. She speaks in a colloquial fashion using many expressions that are new to me but gradually become familiar. The first time I read “me and Steve” instead of “Steve and I”, it brought me up short, but I quickly realized that the more grammatically correct form wouldn’t have worked in the context. Looking forward to reading more in this series."
"Another French book that takes a little bit to get into but once you do it's a major roller coaster ride. Antoinette Conway (one of the detectives from Secret Place) has a case that's suppose to be a no-brainer domestic murder. However, in true Tana French writing, it's much deeper than that. She and her partner, Steve Moran, uncover the truth only to have it jeopardized by others in the squad. Of course, I always highly recommend any and all Tana French novels. "
"Yay for Detective Steve Moran and Tana French. This story is fast paced and claustrophobic like the previous one, and although suspense isn't French's strong suit, this has some. There is serious character development here in the person of Detective Antoinette Conway and sensitive handling of the theme of daughters and fathers, both absent and pseudo. My only quibble is the thin portrayal of some characters, but maybe that isn't so important."
"4.5...4.99....4.75.... ;) I'm loath to give the murder mystery genre 5 stars, however I'd love to this time. Tight, enjoyable murder mystery. Equally my favorite of the series along with Ms. French's first in the series, In The Woods. While the first is potentially more gripping and raw, the latter is tightly written; the voice of the main character, Det Conway is superbly developed, and the muck that is the 'murder squad' unfolds. "
"Just finished Tana French's latest in her Dublin Murder Squad series, The Trespasser. I love her books, and this was no exception. It was compelling and addictive. Plus, listening to the audio narration by Hilda Fay really captured the rhythm of the Irish accents and made the characters pop right off the page. If you're a fan of Tana French, make sure to set aside some time to get caught up in her world."
"Doesn't quite sing the way some of French's other work does; she's usually incandescent and unpredictable, and I sorted the mystery out in the first few chapters this time. Still, what makes French the powerhouse she is isn't explosive endings. It's how satisfying and consistently strong her writing is, how complete the characters are to the point that, once you've read the ending, you'll know it never could have ended another way. A solid read from a perennial favorite. "
"Tana French is such a good writer, and she's created a great world in the Dublin Murder Squad, that I still gave this four stars even though the plot meandered a bit and there was way too much talking in police interviews in this book. The book could have been 50 pages shorter and still done the job. If you've read the other books in the series you'll want to continue with this one. If you haven't, i'd suggest starting at the beginning with In the Woods."
"As always, love some Tana French. I had a hard time with the main character because she's so damn miserable all the time, but it kept me guessing and the ending was totally satisfying."
"This felt more like a cop novel than a crime novel, with most of the plot focused on the inner workings of the murder squad. It was kind of a behind-the-scenes look at how police work together (or not) and delved more into their motives and back stories. I didn't find it as exciting as other French novels and the pace was slower, but it was well written (of course). I'll continue to read any book by this author. "
"Not my favorite from this author (The Likeness and In The Woods still hold top spots), but this was very well done. It took me a little longer to get into our MC. I struggled with her at times, which wasn't fun for me.It's not that I didn't understand her reasoning, but it was a little exhausting being in her head all the time and for a while, I wanted to get away. Ultimately I did like her, but it was hard to get there. I will say the lat 150 pages or so were magnificently done. "
"In The Woods blew my mind and I've enjoyed every single book in the Dublin Murder Squad since, but this one may be my next favorite in the series. So well done. It just felt real and I wasn't entirely sure which way this case was going- I had a good idea, but it wasn't 'ho hum, yawn figured out in chapter two' "
"Another excellent and engrossing mystery from Tana French. Like all of French's books, the most striking thing about The Trespasser is the uncanny feeling she projects throughout. All of French's mysteries have this quality. The crimes are always crazily unrealistic, but they dramatize some of the darkest parts of the human psyche in ways that are extremely compelling. "
"I love Tana French. She has such a way with creating characters who are real and dialogue that is completely believable. I was disappointed in The Secret Place, but thought The Trespassers was quite good. The truth is, French's least effective novel is still head and shoulders above most other authors. I'll continue to read anything she writes!"
"I really, really like the partnership between Antoinette and Steve. This is one of French's better books. Rob Ryan from In the Woods still haunts me from time to time, so I don't think these characters will get under my skin in quite the same way, but this ranks with Faithful Place as one top-notch piece of writing."
"Tana French has done it again: written another first-person detective novel that winds together a perfectly paced story with enough twists and turns to stay exciting but remain realistic, a compelling yet not quite reliable narrator, an atmosphere-rich world, and dialogue exchanges that Elmore Leonard would have approved of."
"To be honest, the motive for this crime left me cold, but the protagonist was SUCH a badass that she made up for the far fetched plot points. I think Tana French has become an automatic buy for me after this book. Few things make me as happy as a nice, fat whodunit.

(And that's the 2016 Goodreads Challenge done and dusted, baybeh.)"
"I always highly anticipate Tana French books, and this was one of her best recent Murder Squad installments. Even though it features the same pair of detectives as in The Secret Place, I thought this was a tighter book and much more suspenseful. I also like that it was all first-person; she didn't switch perspectives or time frames like she did in #5.

In some ways Conway reminded me of Cassie, from The Likeness. I'm not sure if it's because both are women in a male-dominant police force in Dublin or whether it was the uncertainty that seeped through in both narratives (Conway because of her own issues, Cassie because of her relationship with Rob). Conway is still her own person, and I like that she and Stephen have a friendship and there's no hint of any kind of romance or chemistry (outside of how well they interview a suspect together).

What happened: 
We learn more and more that the murder of Aislinn Murray appears to not have been done by Rory, her new love interest. There are a few things that don't add up, including a) Aislinn's friend Lucy alluding that she was dating a married man, b) the fact that Aislinn's appliances were turned off after she was killed, seeming to allow for some kind of alibi for the murderer and c) Rory is lying about something... but he doesn't seem the murdering kind.

After multiple interviews, Conway and Moran learn that he's lying about being a bit of a stalker - he was so into her, that he lingered outside of her house, looking in her kitchen window, before leaving to go buy her flowers. The facts that didn't line up before are because he'd previously checked out her neighborhood, wanting to walk along the same roads she did, or shop at the same stores she would have. That's just a massive infatuation. From pretty near the beginning, Conway and Stephen start to think some kind of internal affairs situation is at fault- why was Aislinn so interested in past gang activities, and coincidentally, both of the cases she seemed most interested in were handled by a pair of detectives still on the force, Breslin and McCann. And Breslin is the smooth voiced operator who O""Kelly assigned to work with her and Moran on the murder, which she thinks is purposeful so he can monitor them and be sure nothing is discovered against him. But then she starts to doubt herself, thinking (based on prior small pranks) that the whole precinct is against her, trying to make her come up with a theory so outlandish (the gang affiliation) that she's discredited and O'Kelly has no choice but to dismiss her from the team. She thinks Breslin is being too obvious, deliberately drawing attention to his wad of money, for example, and Stephen's offering too many ""what ifs"" for any of this to be true. Toward the end of the book, she's inclined to side with Breslin, trying to pin it on Rory. She and Moran happen to run into each other despite the fight they get into, and they both agree that something is fishy. At first, they think Breslin and Aislinn were having an affair, but the case hinges on Lucy, Ash's best friend, who finally tells them the real story.

It turns out that Aislinn grew up thinking the disappearance of her father negatively impacted her life. He disappeared when she was a girl, and Det. McCann was on the team who was looking for him, and he, enamored by Aislinn's beautiful and needy mother, spent a lot of time with them, constantly assuring them that a man wouldn't just leave his wife and child. He does find out that her father sailed off to England with a younger woman. McCann decided to not say anything to Aislinn and her mom, thinking ignorance is bliss, but Aislinn finds this out years later, after her father is already dead. She's angry that he didn't tell them and she hatches a plan - to flirt with McCann and lead him away from his wife and kids, planning to dump him so he knows a) what it's like to be abandoned and b) that it is possible for a man to leave his family. She is very clever with how she plans it, and he only learns at the end through Conway that Aislinn ensnared him because of his connection with her father's case. He goes over to her house one night, assuming she'll be waiting for him to arrive out of the blue, and sees that she's preparing a romantic dinner, but not for him. (Aislinn, according to Lucy, was head over heels for Rory and was actually considering ditching her plans for McCann to pursue something with him.) He's angry - he was going to leave his wife for her and she's seeing someone else! He kills her and then asks Breslin to help cover it up. At the end, Conway and Moran take it to O'Kelly, who ends up confronting McCann about it and asking for his resignation. It's implied that O'Kelly will have to step down, too, so as to not throw suspicion on how things are being handled internally. That's how the book ends.

The small pranks, by the way, are all the fault of Roche, and she has to come to grips that the ""them against me"" theory she had, the ""men against me"" mentality, was (mostly) all in her head."
"Classy Tana French novel - brilliant as usual. Dripping with suspense on every page, and bends your mind in all sorts of ways to get you thinking on the solution of the case. I loved the voice of the main character, and her snide commentary she gave on what she observed. This was a good book to use as an escape world in my times of starting school back up again. "
"This is not my usual genre. I read enough reviews of this book that praised it, however, that I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. Great characters, good mystery, and it kept me riveted until the end. Apparently it's the sixth in a series, but it functions well as a standalone. I would highly recommend this book."
A solidly entertaining and occasionally moving crime novel. I found myself wondering throughout if all the inner-monologue/focus on the main character's mental health and feelings was necessary but once I finished I was glad that Tana French spent so much time digging deep into her (anti)heroine's neurosis and history.
"I’ll read anything Tana French writes — I love her characters, dialogue, sense of place and how the mystery unfolds. This was satisfying. One small gripe — the journalist plot line did nothing for me (and I am not just nitpicking as a former journalist). Didn’t seem necessary to move the plot along."
"Few authors do skewed perspective as well as Mrs. French.
This book reminded me most about the first entry. Oftentimes it was hard to read as you want to take the protagonist and have a few earnest words with her. On the other fronts, same as always. Great mystery, great interview scenes, interesting characters.
If you look for downsides, it would be the pacing, which is a but erratic sometimes."
"A beautiful young woman is found dead in her apartment on a Saturday night. It sounds like a typical police procedural case, but it's not. How could it be? Tana French mysterious are brilliantly written. Her prose will pull you in and suck you under. Exceptional character development and great dialogue too. "
"Снова учебник по травматике, по тому, какую именно стену она выстраивает между человеком и миром, не давая поверить, что возможны иные стратегии - ведь было когда-то больно, и психика делает все, чтобы избегать этой боли. И запирает в тюрьме одиночества, ага.

"Lovely narration. As an American, reading the print of these books does me a disservice, I think.

The mystery itself wasn't as compelling as others in the Dublin Murder Squad series, but the surrounding story was wonderful."
"Tana French does it again. She forays into the Dublin murder squad and mucks about in the main characters psyche, tumbles with a number of options for the resolution, and maintains a creditable police procedural. I've read them all to this point and hope she's working on another book."
"This was not my favorite Dublin Murder Squad (that would be ""Broken Harbor""), but it was still excellent. Tana French is just so good. The problem with being caught up on the series is that I now I guess I have to wait a couple of years for another one. "
"Another stellar work from Tana French. Great writing, an intricate plot that is unraveled with just the right pace, and characters that pop off the page are hallmarks of this author's work and this book had them all. One of my favorite authors who has always delivered."
"I love Tana French's psychological take on murder mystery! Do some of these internal monologues take FOREVER? Yes, but I actually don't mind. There's something about the way she writes people that I find both engrossing and calming. "
"Tana French has done it again - great book.

Plenty of twists and turns, fantastic characters and really well written.

I love how each book stands by itself, the main characters change each time but the atmosphere is consistent."
"In the final analysis, this was really well done. I must say I was nearly heartbreakingly disappointed as the story was coming to a close and then everything came together in a surprising and satisfying way. I found this to be a page turner with good psychological insight. "
"Great mystery murder detective book. A very interesting look at what it is like to be a woman detective in a man's world. Tough to say the least, yeah. French is a great writer, and the book is well worth reading.
"
"I always expect Tana French's books to be part of a series, with recurring characters. I don't remember these characters appearing in her previous books, but that's OK. This is another great story set in the Dublin Murder Squad. I really like her writing style."
Tana French doesn't disappoint. Her dialogue puts you right in the room -- I was as exhausted and keyed up after their witness/suspect interviews as they were. I keep finding myself thinking 'kip' for a nap or 'pint' for a drink :) 4 1/2
"The storyline and character development were both great. However, the book lagged a great deal in the middle. I would guess many, many pages could have been edited out. It would make for a much cleaner story."
"really loved main plot but GRIMACE EMOJI @ this series giving its first poc lead a shitty absentee dad, tbh! everything else was superb and i really wish i could give this five stars, but.... grimace emoji"
"French's latest is another great addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series. While it lacks the ""creepiness"" that some of her novels have, it more than makes up for that with its characters. If you love Tana French, then you will enjoy this."
"As I've written before, I think Tana French is best when her writing concentrates on the process and psychology of her detectives, and this book certainly does that. But it also drags a little here and there, and the protagonist is just a little unlikeable."
"This took me a while to get through. Though I like the characters, the plot moved slowly at first. But it did pick up and provided some interesting twists and turns. Who will be the main character in Tana French's next book??"
"I love Tana French. She handles suspense and crime skillfully, I fall into her characters, which are complicated thoughtful and interesting. Most of all I just enjoy how well she handles a detective story! This one did not disappoint! "
"I just read The Secret Place and am trying not to compare the two, but I loved this as much as I love all of Tana French's books. I thought it could have been 50 pages shorter, but I got caught up in the mystery once I hit the 50% mark and then I couldn't put the book down. "
"Wieder ein großartiger Krimi von Tana French, der seine Leser vor allem durch psychologisch fein sezierte Verhöre führt. Der Idee zu dem Fall selbst ist weniger spannend/überraschend als bei den vorangegangenen Krimis der Autorin."
"Tana French is a fantastic storyteller, and I love listening to the Irish accent in this audiobook. It seems like it could move just a little bit faster, and maybe the story could be told almost as well in about half of the length of this book."
"I listened to the audiobook read by Hilda Fay. Excellent portrayal of the tough Antoinette Conway and Dublin murder squad lads, a vast array of accents and Irish slang. A little too long perhaps, but kept me interested, as all of Tana French's books have done : read all, liked all. "
"I really enjoyed her style. Loved this book. Thriller. Mystery etc. had it all.
This story will be a script I would say. Highly recommend
This is book 6 in a series apparently so I'll have to start at 1 now. Hahahha"
"Too long since I read a new Tana French but this more than made up for the wait. Crowley's character - her aggressions and doubts, her thought processes and relationships with those around her drive the very well-executed plot."
"Another good summer read. Please, Tana French more of Detective Antoinette Conway.

Themes: absent fathers, sexism in the workplace, girly makeovers. Finished this on the trip back from driving to Alaska with October.

Re-read, January 2024."
"Very good book. Well written well paced. It kept me turning the pages while I should have been working on my dissertation. And I'm not usually a crime thriller guy, but Tana French put a lot of depth into the characters and stories. Give it a read. "
"Top notch. While writing a mystery slash police procedural, she manages to get into heart and mind and emotions and relationships and backstabbing and partnership and ambition and toughness and every other goddamn thing under the sun and I love it slash her."
I thought this was one of the better of the series. French has an extraordinary ability to make a crime book be only barely about the crime and so much more about all the very complex characters at play. 
"The heroine is the narrator Detective Antoinette Conway, an outsider in the Investigation Department. She, the only woman in the men's collective, is a constant object of sexist jokes and unpleasant hairpins. In addition, racial hostility is not directly mentioned, but it cannot be completely excluded. Conway is a half-breed, knows nothing about his father, except for three stories successively fed by his mother: an Egyptian prince, a medic from Saudi Arabia, a Brazilian guitarist, but to compare his own appearance with the local type and come to the conclusion of a discrepancy - you don't need to be seven spans. Anyway, the daughter of a cleaner, made a career in the police, reaching the heights of the hierarchy - the homicide department.

Ashlyn's case, which is assigned to her and her partner by the head, promises to change her position in the department for the better, before she and Steve mostly sat on domestic murders. Here is a young woman, a rare beauty, such as it is easy to imagine on the podium or on the screen, the trophy wife of a businessman or the girlfriend of a gangster, but Ashlin led a modest life, and most importantly, she made a transformation from an ordinary-looking fat woman with her own hands. At the same time, she, a classic example of a self-made woman, did not convert her appearance into life benefits in any way, remaining a bookish girl, a dreamer and a dreamer at heart. And she had a romantic dinner on the night of the murder, not with someone from the powerful, but with a nerd, the owner of a bookstore.

It is interesting, as always with Tana French, logically, and with a lot of technical details. In addition to the solution, an interesting look at how we see the situation from the inside and what it is in reality; what we really are and how others perceive us. And once again about the futility of revenge.

Отцы и дочери
Я твердо знаю: если мы выйдем на то, на что охотимся, то нам обоим головы не сносить.
Тана Френч и ее Дублинский отдел расследований занимают совершенно особое положение среди детективных серий. Объясню: работа полиции тради��ионно воспринимается как нечистая. Необходимая, овеянная романтическим ореолом, дающая некоторые полномочия, но изначально непрестижная. У Френч с точностью до наоборот, работа в гардах вообще признак социального статуса, а в Убийствах вовсе creme de la creme, и это сквозной мотив ее романов. Странно, какая может быть элитарность в возне с трупами и перетряхивании гор грязного белья? Однако книги ее хороши необычайно, а потому, why not?

""Тень за спиной"" не исключение. Героиня-рассказчица детектив Антуанетта Конвей, аутсайдер Отдела расследований. Она, единственная женщина в мужском коллективе, постоянный объект сексистских шуточек и неприятных шпилек. Кроме того, напрямую о расовой неприязни не говорится, но полностью исключить ее нельзя. Конвей полукровка, ничего не знает о своем отце, кроме трех последовательно скормленных матерью баек: египетский принц, медик из Саудовской Аравии, бразильский гитарист, но сопоставить собственную внешность с местным типажом и прийти к выводу о несовпадении - семи пядей не надо быть. Так или иначе, дочь уборщицы, сделала в полиции карьеру, добравшись до высот иерархии - отдела убийств.

Дело Ашлин, которое поручает им с напарником руководитель, обещает изменить ее положение в отделе к лучшему, прежде они со Стивом в основном на бытовых убийствах сидели. Здесь молодая женщина, редкая красавица, такую легко представить на подиуме или на экране, трофейной женой бизнесмена или подружкой гангстера, но Ашлин вела скромную жизнь, а главное - совершила преображение из невзрачной толстушки с��оими руками. При этом, она, классический пример селфмейдвумен, никак не конвертировала внешность в жизненные блага, в душе оставаясь книжной девочкой, фантазеркой и мечтательницей. И романтический ужин в вечер убийства был у нее назначен не с кем-то из сильных мира сего, а с ботаном, владельцем книжной лавки.

Парень, который так и не попал в дом красавицы и подозревал, что она посмеялась над ним, становится главным подозреваемым. Приданный в помощь Антуанетте и Стиву опытный детектив Бреслин, похоже убежден, что убил он. Только напарникам не нравится, как активно он продвигает эту версию, отметая любые сомнения, а между тем, прямых улик против букиниста нет. Что-то здесь явно нечисто и не замешан ли доблестный Бреслин? Расследование получает новый импульс, когда Конвей, до Убийств работавшая в Пропажах (поиск людей), узнает от бывших коллег, что отец Ашлин пропал без вести в ее детстве, и поиски, активно, но безрезультатно велись долгое время, однако получить достоверные сведения удалось совсем недавно.

Это меняет взгляд не только на личность убитой и ситуацию в целом, но определенным образом сближает с ней безотцовщину Антуанетту, одним из главных мотивов которой поступить на работы в полицию был поиск отца. Интересно, как всегда у Таны Френч, логично, и с массой технических подробностей. В придачу к разгадке, интересный взгляд на то, как мы видим ситуацию изнутри и какова она в реальности; каковы мы на самом деле и какими нас воспринимают окружающие. И в очередной раз о бесплодности мести."
October release!
A good story although it was a little slow and over-wrought in areas. I liked the ending.
"I was provided a free ebook copy of this from Edelweiss and the publisher. Slow burn with this one, but satisfying. "
"Another tense, gripping mystery from French. I suspect her many fans will sweat and fret their way trough this, as I did."
"Not my favorite book in the Dublin Murder series but still a solid, compelling, and twisty fun read."
Brilliant plot twists
"Review up at Criminal Element.
"
"Outstanding writing, and French's most compelling Murder Squad officer yet. I hope that she makes Annette her protagonist again, as her personal growth is as interesting as the mystery she solves."
This ended up being a lot better than I expected. I never really warmed to Antoinette though.
"3.75, took awhile to get into it, like this author, but not my favorite of hers."
"Ms. French turns in another solid addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series.

This one features Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran."
A study in procedure if ever there was one! 
https://librocubicultarist.com/2016/1...
I'm already looking forward to #7!
Tana French never disappoints. 
"This one starts off slowly and has a bit of a claustrophobic feel, but the ending is so beautifully written all flaws are forgiven."
"Couldn't put this down - one of her best! Pacy, plenty of twists and turns, complex characters, keeps you involved all the way through."
 A bit slower read than the previous 5 books. (3.5 stars rounded to 4)
One of Tana French’s better ones. Great complex character in lead detective Antoinette Conway. Turned a relatively simple plot into a thriller.
One of Tana's best. She is amazing and her stories make you think. You never know how it will end. Never.
"Loved this, as usual for her. And it was great seeing more of Conway and Moran."
"Very well done, Ms. French. Will be waiting anxiously for your next book.

"
"I love Tana French and was happy that her newest book did not disappoint. So much more than a suspense story, with well-developed characters and great writing. "
Lots of twists; intellectually challenging and smartly written. 
"Fascinating and satisfying. This has landed on some Ten Best lists, but start with the first in the series! "
"This book had it all for me--detailed police procedural, great characters, not too grisly, the Irish accents (audio version). Sad to be caught up on the series!"
"Last book finished 2016. Always enjoy this author. Excellent style, although I felt the story dragged a bit. "
Another of Tana French's gripping Dublin Murder Squad books. She really sucks you in and won't let you go until you finish the book. Already looking forward to her next one!
"I still like the first book
In the wood
But this one was good too"
"Started a little slow, but the ending made up for the terrible ""The Secret Place"". "
In spite of the unlikable narrator and meandering storyline this was a good detective story..
highly readable psychological detective thriller with great character development by the master mystery writer
I always enjoy Tana French.
Tana French doesn't disappoint with another solid story from the Dublin Murder Squad. 
"Great plot, interesting characters. A bit too long and overdone at points but it kept drawing me in and I was eager to find out what really happened. 3.5 stars. "
Havn't read one I didn't enjoy . 'The Secret Place ' impressed my daughter when I update my language skills to her generation .
ya gotta not trespass
Possibly my favorite Tana French book yet. Best protagonist by far and enough twists to keep me involved in the mystery. 
"i found this book a bit hard to get into. At first it really seemed to drag. It did get much, much better and I ended up quite enjoying the story."
"I feel like I know Detective Conway after reading this. I enjoyed the story, the character development, and all the Irish phrases. "
"""I can't wait for them all to bring it on. Danger doesn't bother me. I'll eat danger with a spoon."" Detective Antoinette Conway is so tough."
My favorite tana french so far
"4.5

This may be the best yet!"
"4.5.

Tana French is so remarkably consistently good. I always know what I'm getting into when I pick up one of her books, and The Trespasser gives everything I expect: fascinating (and in some ways deeply unlikable) detectives, twists and turns, hard police work, in-depth and dialogue-heavy interview scenes… it was wonderful, as they all are wonderful. I did find Antoinette Conway, the narrator, a little more frustrating than I've found past detectives (more in the spoilers discussion if you're curious), so in the middle when there aren't a lot of new leads but there is a lot of time in her head I lost some interest and engagement. But I loved everything about the end and thought it was absolutely perfect in tone and substance for the book. So, I think on a reread where I know where the ending is going, I would have more patience for the middle and appreciate who Conway is as a character, even as I find myself annoyed with her. The ending gets five stars for me, but the rest of it unfortunately can't quite get above a 3.5 in the middle slog, a 4 at the beginning and less sloggy bits. I'm devastated that there aren't any more Dublin Murder Squad books out. I've savored these six but couldn't hold out any longer. I really want her to write more.

Detective Antoinette Conway is a badass, but everyone else working murder (besides, of course, her partner Steve Moran) hates her. So, she gets the boring cases, like this one where a pretty young woman setting up her house for a date got killed. Everyone knows it's gotta be the boyfriend, but Conway doesn't trust anything and follows every lead, even when that's not a good idea.

Spoilers Discussion

In the middle, I literally wanted to shake Conway. If she were my friend, I would've nicely asked her to please please please chill out. I get why she is so defensive and protective, but, of course, it actually works against her. Everything would be easier for her if she let down her guard a little, if she didn't privilege toughness over literally everything else. Her life would be much healthier, and she would be much happier. She's so concerned with how everyone else is going to see her-- she can't ask anyone to come help her with the man she knows is stalking her house because she thinks it will change their relationship to have her… ask for help? She thinks other people can own her because she needed something real from them? It's so infuriating to read about, and all of her judgements and her harshness. She is absolutely someone with whom I would be friends, but I would absolutely be constantly trying to tell her that everything is okay! And she doesn't need to take herself so seriously! And not everyone is out to get her! And vulnerability is okay!

Also, all of the parallels between Conway and Aislinn. Personality-wise, mistake-wise, so similar. Aislinn is the person Conway is most scared of becoming, that kind of naïveté and obliviousness. I think as foils, they worked extremely well.

This is a big part of why I loved the ending so much. When she took those moments to realize the things that went her way, how O'Kelley might have given them domestics because he wanted them to have a better solve rate, that he took the confession so they wouldn't be part of it, that there was actually really only one idiot who was seriously harassing her and not the whole squad (not that that makes it okay at all, but it feels less overwhelming) and that Moran would be super sad if she left… all of that was very special, because it took so much work, but also so so so so so necessary. I felt that way about the whole ending. Everything just softened a bit, and everything turned out okay, and its infrequent that that happens at the end of a Tana French book, so I loved it.

In terms of the actual murder, there were fewer twists this time around, but I was still satisfied. I hoped Rory didn't do it, because that would've been super boring, and I like that it wasn't gang-related. I also like that it was based on this crazy story, and also that Aislinn is way more intense (and, from, Antoinette's perspective, though not my own, way more badass) than she was given credit for. Everyone gets to feel a little bit vindicated, and that is lovely.

I'll never stop reading Tana French for as long as she keeps writing, especially now that I'm all caught up on her back catalogue and am just going to have to wait patiently as she keeps releasing. Hopefully, she'll stick with her every two years plan and come out with something magnificent next year. Fingers crossed!

Fin!

Good mystery, very well-wrought characters: 94%"
"Tana French is one of the all-time great mystery writers. Period. I've read all of her books now and there's not a single dud among them. The writing is beautiful, the mysteries are well-plotted, and the resolutions actually make sense.

All that said, the one critique I would make is that some of her books have interesting mysteries but weak main characters. Faithful Place and In the Woods had both compelling mysteries and fascinating man characters, as did The Likeness, with the caveat that the set-up is HELLA unbelievable, but Broken Harbor was a heart-breaking mystery fronted by a really unlikeable tightass of a lead character. And while I thought the mystery in The Secret Place was mostly very well-done, the main character is boring as all get out. Likeable and refreshingly normal but boring.

But The Trespasser is the first one I've seen that has a boring mystery led by a strong detective character, which makes this one a little hard to get into. (Personally I prefer the reverse - a can't-put-it-down mystery plot accounts for a lot). The lead detective in The Trespasser, Antoinette Conway, is defensive, prickly, and driven. She's one of the newer detectives on the murder squad and to put it mildly, she's having a hard time fitting in, partly for the expected gross sexual harassment reasons as the only woman on the squad, and partly due to Conway's nature. She doesn't take any shit and she doesn't suffer fools lightly. She is truly a bad-ass bitch in the best, most empowering sense of the word.

The victim, Aisling Murray, is a beautiful young woman who, for much of the book, is a complete enigma. She doesn't seem to have any enemies or unsavory habits-- she doesn't seem to have many passions at all. She's described by everyone who knows her as a dreamer, someone content to watch and make up stories rather than play the lead role in her own life.

The first two-thirds of the book is a lot of wheel-spinning, as Conway and Moran (her partner, the aforementioned refreshingly normal but boring detective from The Secret Place) bounce theories off each other, their frustration building as nothing seems to gel. The key to the mystery feels like a rock hidden in their shoes -- they don't believe Aisling's would-be Prince Charming is the killer but they can't make any other theory fit. Conway is also tormented by her paranoia about the other detectives in her unit, constantly analyzing everything they say or do or don't say or don't do to figure out how they are trying to get at her and force her off the squad. I did enjoy the fact that our heroes made mistakes and had lots of theories that didn't pan out; I hate mysteries with perfect Mary Sue detectives (JD Robb's In Death series, this one's for you). But it dragged on a little too long and it was honestly a little hard to care about who killed Aisling, since she was such a blank slate to us.

The book really picks up about two-thirds of the way through, when you understand how twisted and dark Aisling's dreams had become. She was willing to go to incredible lengths to create the life she wanted, to the point where Conway had to grudgingly admire her after being frustrated by her ineptitude for most of the book. (The later third of the book also brings up a good side discussion about how cops' interactions with victims can have echoes that last a lifetime. The subtitle of this book could be ""Why You Should Never Tell Someone 'It's for Your Own Good.'"") The ending is brilliant-- the mystery picks up speed, moving faster and faster to a can't-put-it-down conclusion, and Conway discovers that the story she's been telling herself about her colleagues and her place in the world are as wrong-headed as the stories that led Aisling to her bloody fate."
"It's funny, this one reminded me of In the Woods a little, what with how the relationship between the partners is front and center and how, I'm sorry to say, antagonizing I found the narrator. Of all the Dublin Murder Squad books, In the Woods is my least favorite, and almost stopped me from finding out how amazing French is as a writer, so I was fighting against this book at times for reminding me of it; in particular for how annoying I found the narrator. With all the other narrators in the series, I either liked them immediately, or French would do something interesting or unexpected with them shortly into the story that would make invested in them (Kennedy stands out in my mind for that). Not the case here. Conway is aggravating: always talking about how she wants to bash someone's head in, picking apart and belittling the victim and most of the people near the case she interviews, and just in general adopting a little too much of the Cool Girl persona she's meant to put on only for suspects. That's never changed or spun of it's head throughout the whole story: Conway is exactly who she says she is. Which, when it comes to scenes like the reunion with her deadbeat dad, turns out to be amazing: she'd said she didn't give a fuck who he was, and she proved it. There's no denying how satisfying that is to read. So a distinction does need to be made for me between her and Rob: I didn't particularly enjoy being in either of their heads, but where Rob is just a shitheel, Conway's braggadocio actually does manifest and become something more than inner diatribe. So: point Conway.But even in the beginning, when I found her the most tedious, this book is so propulsive it mostly doesn't matter. It's been a while since I've read the rest of the series, but I feel like this is the most gripping, adrenaline heavy of the lot. Everything is placed so precisely you can't help but get chills, and the resolution is incredibly satisfying. Doubly so if you've been reading this in order and this serves - as it should - as the final word on the Squad. (Which is seriously impressive: writing this so it can be enjoyable to the reader who's only just found this series, and to the reader who's been with it all along.)I also really liked that French opted not to go for high drama when it came to Conway and Moran's relationship. I kind of figured she wouldn't, since them becoming partners is sort of what makes the ending to The Secret Place so beautifully bittersweet, but still it was nice to see that they only ever just had a row, and then when it was time they were able to make up. The stability of their partnership makes so many scenes in this book; it would have been genuinely sad to ruin it. (See: In the Woods.)My only other complaint - but not really - is that it would've been nice to have a change of scenery so that French would get a chance to bust out that gorgeous prose instead of being stuck trying to draw atmosphere out of the gray sky, the wind, and the occasional rain over and over again, but whatever. There are the other books in the series for that.Again, again, again: I am so, so glad I gave French's books a second chance. I have gotten so much enjoyment out of them, it's crazy, and this one definitely stands at the head of the pack. It's a pure rush, pretty much all the way down, and it's so, so satisfying. I'll miss the Squad, but this was definitely a worthy conclusion. I highly recommend this and (most of) the rest of this series."
"Y llegamos a la última, al menos por ahora, entrega de la serie de la Brigada de Homicidios de Dublín de la escritora Tana French. French repite con los inspectores protagonistas de la anterior entrega, Steven Moran y Antoinette Conway, solo que esta vez la historia está narrada bajo el punto de vista de Antoinette, que es la única mujer en la brigada.

En El lugar de los secretos, el anterior libro, French experimentaba un poco en su narrativa lo cual dejaba bastante descolocado al lector, porque básicamente esta es una saga policíaca. Aquí ya volvemos a la trama policial pura y dura, de hecho creo que de los seis es el que más se centra en la investigación y un poco menos en la vida personal de la protagonista (que también, eso French nunca lo deja de lado).

Antoinette y Steven están a punto de irse a casa tras el turno de noche cuando les cae en el último momento un caso de asesinato. Aislinn Murray, una chica de veintitantos, ha muerto en su apartamento tras golpearse la cabeza con el poyete de la chimenea. No parece un caso muy complicado: lo más probable es que Aislinn se peleara con su novio, este la empujara y le provocara la muerte. Y cuando el novio en cuestión les cuenta una historia que no se sostiene demasiado, solo les queda conseguir que confiese. Pero cuando la amiga de la víctima les cuenta que Aislinn tenía un novio secreto, Conway y Moran se preguntan si el caso no será más complejo de lo que aparenta ser. Además, Conway tiene el vago de recuerdo de haber conocido a la víctima años atrás.

Cuando cojo un libro de esta saga ya sé que voy a pasar un buen rato y una vez más French nos ofrece una novela policíaca muy bien hilada en la que la verdad va más allá de lo que parece en un inicio, y que puede salpicar a Antoinette y a Steven si no tienen cuidado. El caso de asesinato parece que tampoco va a dar mucho de sí pero vaya si French consigue mantener el interés con todas las teorías que se van montando los dos detectives, especialmente cuando Conway recuerda de qué conocía a Aislinn. Cuando se descubre todo el pastel es glorioso y está muy bien llevado, me encantó el final.

Además del caso en sí la novela incide en el acoso que sufre Antoinette en la brigada, cuyos miembros se muestran hostiles con ella y no la quieren allí. Conway es una protagonista genial (y tengo que felicitar a la traductora por el arte con el que ha traducido todos los insultos de Antoinette, que no son precisamente pocos) y su relación con Moran es uno de los puntos fuertes. Me gustó muchísimo cuando Antoinette empieza a preguntarse si su amistad con Steven, al que creía su único en la brigada, es realmente genuina, y cómo evoluciona todo a partir de ahí. También tenemos algo de drama familiar pero no tiene tanto peso en la trama como en otras entregas de la serie sino que más bien sirve como catalizador para que Conway termine por encajar algunas piezas sueltas del caso.

A estas alturas todo lo que pueda decir de esta serie es repetirme. Simplemente, es genial, French tiene una prosa fabulosa (aquí se corta un poco con su pluma evocadora, va más al grano en general) y las investigaciones siempre son interesantes, incluso hace esos interrogatorios interminables superamenos de leer. Creo que Tras Piel Ajena este Intrusión sería mi favorito, precisamente los dos cuyo punto de vista recae en las dos inspectoras. Ojalá French escriba alguno más, menos mal que todavía me quedan otro par de libros suyos autoconclusivos por leer."
"This book is a bit outside my usual fare—I rarely read mysteries or thrillers—but I thought it would be an enjoyable diversion, and it handily met and surpassed that expectation. I read this book over the course of about a day and a half, and I relished every moment of it! It wasn’t a perfect book, certainly, but it was still damn good!

I don’t want to give much of a plot synopsis here, because I don’t want this review to contain spoilers—suffice to say that it’s a murder mystery complicated by many factors, one of which being the perp’s identity and another of which being the narrator’s mild unreliability.

I tend to prefer books that are more character-driven than plot-driven, because I generally find them more engaging and compelling, but this book both engaged and compelled me 100% on a plot basis. (That’s both good and bad, but mostly an impressive feat.) Page to page, it was gripping, and the pacing was perfect. It kept me reading curiously with virtually no lulls, yet without making me feel like I was being yanked around or endlessly battered by the winds of change. The narrator is just as confused as the reader through most of the book, which really helps the twists and turns feel real—surprising for their content, but not surprising for their existence. As we read, we know how little we know, and we know that we (and the narrator) are really feeling around in the dark; we know there’s something out there, but we’re just stumbling around with our hands out looking for it, and we’re aware of that. The balance of clues and speculation is perfect in this book to keep the intrigue high, but deservedly so. Every plot twist was satisfactorily foreshadowed, but none of them were obvious.

This book has two other major strengths, which I think are pretty closely related: Tana French does atmosphere and character voice with utmost mastery. I’ve never been to Ireland, but I feel like I’ve been to Dublin after reading this book. The sense of place was intense and really gave the book a strong form—the city’s particular culture was almost a character in the book itself. The book is written with a fair bit of dialect, and there was no shortage of words I’d never heard before, but they’re all contextually evident and deployed with intent. Between the narrator’s dialect and her intense, stand-offish, paranoid attitude, her voice is not only unique and consistent throughout the book, but creates a good bit of the book’s tension itself.

But one weakness of the book was that I felt her character didn’t hold together (or, really, exist) beyond her career and her voice. There were attempts to flesh her out and humanize her, including friends that never enter the scene anyway and a bit of personal parental drama, but these attempts felt disconnected and rang false to me. The things she did that weren’t related to her work didn’t seem to have much purpose. The narrator is a multidimensional character just in the sphere of her professional life, but outside that sphere she seems flat and unrealistic. Mostly these attempts at further characterization were incidental to the book and didn’t have much effect beyond a moment of eye-rolling, but there is one plot point that deals directly with her father, and I found that to be abrupt, nonsensical, and a real weak link in the plot.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable book to read, and when I’m looking for another engaging mystery, I’ll definitely be checking out more of Tana French’s work."
"Für Antoinette Conway hat sich ein Karrieretraum erfüllt, als sie zur Mordkommission versetzt wurde, doch schon nach wenigen Monaten ist sie ziemlich desillusioniert. Als einzige Frau hatte sie dort bislang wenig zu lachen, wurde Opfer dämlicher Streiche, blöder Sprüche und übergriffiger Berührungen und hat das Gefühl, dass sie nie so ganz dazugehören wird in dieser Männerclique.

Einzig Stephen Moran, selbst noch nicht lange dabei, scheint auf ihrer Seite zu sein. Zwar nervt sie, die eher zu Zynismus neigt, sein stets optimistischer Idealismus und sein Bedürfnis, Fälle immer aus jedem nur möglichen Blickwinkel komplett zu beleuchten, um Fehler auszuschließen, doch er ist ein guter, verlässlicher Partner, und beide sind durchaus stolz, als ihnen zum ersten Mal die Leitung der Ermittlungen in einem potentiellen Mordfall übertragen wird.

Aislinn Murray, eine sehr attraktive junge Frau, wurde auf eine anonyme Meldung hin mit schweren Kopfverletzungen tot in ihrer Wohnung aufgefunden. Der Tatverdacht fällt natürlich zuerst auf den Mann, mit dem sie an dem Abend zu Hause zum Essen verabredet war, und der dienstälteste Kollege in der Ermittlungskommission scheint von dessen Schuld überzeugt, doch Conway und Moran sind sich da nicht so sicher, auch wenn einige Indizien darauf hindeuten könnten. Vielmehr kommt den beiden mit der Zeit ein ziemlich übler Verdacht, der bedeuten würde, dass sie niemandem mehr vertrauen können außer hoffentlich einander ...

Die Paarung Conway/Moran haben wir schon im letzten Band der Dublin-Reihe in Aktion erlebt, diesmal kehrt sich allerdings der Erzählfokus um - jetzt erzählt Antoinette aus ihrer Sicht. Conway ist eine interessante Figur, eine unzugänglich wirkende junge Frau, die sich nicht leicht anderen gegenüber öffnet und ihre persönlichen Bürden hinter einer abgebrühten, schroffen Fassade versteckt. Gefühllos ist sie keineswegs, aber mit Gefühlsduselei kann sie nichts anfangen.

Von dem Fall Aislinn Murray hängt viel für sie ab. Bewährt sie sich als leitende Ermittlerin, könnte sie sich vielleicht endlich mehr Respekt im Team verschaffen, setzt sie die Sache in den Sand, kann sie einpacken. Und ausgerechnet dieser Fall ist nicht so simpel, wie er zunächst gewirkt hat.

Wie verzwickt er genau ist, kristallisiert sich ganz langsam heraus, in langen Befragungen und Fallbesprechungen. Dieser Band spielt sich hauptsächlich in Verhörräumen und dem Konferenzraum ab, der dem Ermittlungsteam als Zentrale dient. Große Action sucht man bei Tana French grundsätzlich meist vergebens, wobei dieses Buch noch ein wenig ruhiger daherkommt und hauptsächlich von Dialogen lebt - innerhalb des Teams, mit Verdächtigen, mit potentiellen Zeugen. Das ist anfangs selbst für Kenner der Autorin ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig, funktioniert aber letztendlich gut, Der interne Umgang unter Kollegen spielt hier eine große Rolle, somit ist es auch folgerichtig, dass die Polizeistation in der Dubliner Burg Hauptschauplatz bleibt.

Wieder ein guter Krimi aus der Feder von Tana French, der ohne viel Haudrauf und Blutvergießen auskommt und trotzdem auf leise Art spannend ist. Auch die persönliche Entwicklung der Hauptfigur hat mir gut gefallen und ich hoffe, dass wir ihr noch mal in einem anderen Band begegnen werden."
"4.5 stars

Time after time it's left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.

The last two books of the DMS series have been quite interesting. The Secret Place really stands out; it’s the only installment not entirely told from the perspective of the detective and the actual investigation takes place over the course of a day. And The Trespasser (I refuse to consider the possibility that this may be the final book in the series but more on that later) is different in that the actual case take a bit of a back seat as TF sets her gaze on the misogyny and politics that exist within the Murder Squad. This is interesting because you can almost sense that TF is itching to break away from the conventions of her highly acclaimed series, and it’s not surprising that the two books TF has published since The Trespasser have been stand-alone novels.

When we meet Antoinette Conway in this book, things are not going well. Conway is experiencing a major burnout. The Murder Squad is nothing like she had imagined it to be. Even the solve in the last book - which was a fairly high profile case - didn't do much for Conway.
She's still being treated like a rookie, getting shit cases, sharing the squad room with the man who harassed her, dealing with men that are pompous, patronizing and powerful. It's like they are all in on a joke and she's the punchline. There's someone messing with her cases and making everything so much more difficult than it has to be. Conway is on edge all the time, constantly looking over her shoulder. It is exhausting and frustrating.

When Conway and Steve get Aislinn Murray's case, there's something about this young woman and her death that suggests it's not a typical lovers' quarrel gone bad. This case is messy, and the dynamics within the squad make it messier. There was never a point in the book where I was bored - TF makes the inner politics as interesting as she possibly can - but still, it wasn't as compelling as the other books in the series. However, this book definitely hit a point after which I was like, oh yeahh THIS is why I'm obsessed with TF. I like how nothing is straightforward or simplistic about her characters and their actions. Everything is complex: people, friendships, relationships.

Also, I LOVE what TF did with the Steve-Antoinette dynamic in this book. I love how they work together and every interrogation scene they do together is just fantastic. It's been an absolute pleasure watching their character development.

Now, the real question: Is The Tresspasser the end of the DMS series? I refuse to believe that's the case, because the new character/potential-narrator-of-book-7 made a really strong impression on me in what was a very brief guest appearance. Plus, this guy is an Undercover detective, and we know TF wants to branch out, so this is the perfect opportunity for her to do that while also continuing on with the series. I am thinking I should email her about this...

"I do believe that Tana French is hands down the genius of police procedurals and ""The Trespasser"" is incontrovertible proof. I've read all of her Dublin Murder Squad books--except for ""The Secret Place""--but I will circle back to that in a bit.

Antoinette Conway is loner, lone wolf, rogue, feminist warrior, self-possessed and self-conscious, all at once. And because of her, you blast through tedious witness interviews, theory-making, murder squad politics, thick CSI-like passages and psychological wranglings that would make Freud and Jung rub their chins in wonder. Police procedurals are among my favorite type of crime/thriller story, and I realize the tedium, boredom, repetition, dud clues can be a slog for some people. But TF knows how to rope us in, and keep us in rapt attention regardless of the technicalities of detective work.

And as she is brilliant at it, nothing is what it appears. Who doesn't play the game of trying to figure it out. Like all of her books, I never can until the end. And my breath catches at those pivotal ""a-ha"" moments that TF is so clever at placing.

In ""The Trespasser"" we have a murder. Of course. Conway and her still-feeling-him-out partner Stephen Moran catch the case and they are disappointed that it appears to be ""just a domestic""--nothing exciting, nothing promotion and glory producing. Until they dig in. I just love it, because we have a set of suspects, who could be, maybe are, maybe not, red herrings. And I keep on turning the pages maniacally because I know that TF has the big reveal coming. I'll quit it at that, no spoilers/hints on this one, although you can scan all of the 5,085 reviews on Goodreads and figure it out. Maybe.

The murder story itself is a doozy, a complete mind bash. But I could not get enough of Antoinette and her psychology, her story, her attack on living life, her job, and her self-deprecating denouement. As I was transfixed by Antoinette's world (and head), I couldn't help the comparison of #GillianFlynn's Camille Preaker with Antoinette--troubled, brilliant, damaged, relentless, flawed. It's the flawed part that gets me right between the eyes, every time. ""The Trespasser,"" like its sisters that came before it, is not an ordinary, easy crime mystery. It's filled with psychological landmines--impossible to navigate if you (the reader) like to solve the murder all by yourself.

#IWish. There seems to be two camps regarding Tana French and her approach--the main character of her next Dublin Murder Squad book is a minor character in the book that came before. Some people say that one must read them in order. Others say they all stand by themselves. The only TF book I did not read was ""The Secret Place,"" where we first meet Antoinette. ""IWish I did. This may be the reason I was so frustrated with the linchpin to Antoinette's story: father abandonment. I'll find out sooner or later when I redial and pick up ""The Secret Place."" Antoinette: can't get her out of my head."
"The Trespasser by Tana French

'Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.'

This reflection of Conway's gave me my first laugh and it pretty much sums up the gist of this detective story. From then on my interest increased. It's all about people's stories and the trick is in working out which stories are more credible. For a time in there, I almost lost sight of who was the good guy and who was the bad guy as Tana French sets a scene of mistrust in the Murder squad; there were so many conflicting stories - the victim's story, the suspects' stories, the best friend's story and the detectives' stories.

Antoinette Conway and her partner, Steve Moran were assigned a case that was looking more like murder than manslaughter. The 'gaffer', their immediate superior officer, Detective Superintendent O'Kelly, was suddenly wanting daily check-ins on a supposedly routine case, Detectives Breslin and O' Cann were trying to push the case along and it seemed as though the entire squad was harassing Antoinette to force her out of Murder squad. To make the pressure more intense, one of her colleagues was tipping off the Press, smearing Antoinette and trying to force her hand in making a hasty arrest.

This is not a riveting story but Tana French has constructed it well; with the gloomy, cold, damp, Irish setting and credibly developed characters who, more often than not, rub each other up the wrong way. The victim's death seemed obvious, a blow knocking her onto the fireplace which crushed the back of her skull. There seemed to be little evidence other than the victim was expecting her boyfriend to dinner and immediately he fell under suspicion. Amidst the mire of Conway's harassment and consequent paranoia, her and Moran sift through the evidence and very quickly agree that something is not as it should be and from then on keep their real intent for private discussion.

How French takes the reader on from there, as the pair investigate some false leads before finally getting the real villains in sight, is very satisfying. Suddenly, like Conway when she smelt a real lead, I was alert and loving the story. Although it is all a carefully elaborated plot leading the reader to the confession by the murderer, the final part of the book was superb. There are a few twists in the plot and eventually it is all sewn together very neatly; to such an extent that Tana French had me feeling sympathy for the murderer instead of the victim. That does not happen with me very often!

I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy a challenge and the path to conviction was certainly that. I gave it four stars."
"This is my first Tana French book I didn’t even read the blurb before starting it -not even before finishing – and I’m glad. It’s actually 3 stars.
Would I reread Tana French… idk. Her writing is great but omg so many unnecessary details?? Or was that to throw us off path – because that’s what crime novelists do: throw the readers off path but keeping it interesting to keep on trying to guess who’s done it. Whenever I think of unnecessary details, I think of the writer being paid by the sentence, so he/she writes more useless nonsense, yes blame it ok capitalism … jk. This is why the book gets 4 stars instead of 5 deja.


Idk if the wmc is a reoccurring character idk if I liked her enough shes cold and thinks the world is out to get her and im glad steve calls her out on it. The parallel between Antoinette’s (seriously ??? is that the best name for a book heroin detective) and the vic’s daddy issue is so unnecessary and what’s the point of having him show up out of the blue? I’m sure the author could’ve come up with better “truce” setting for steve and Antoinette – but I liked that he was so quick to her rescue definitely shows that there is someone by her side out there.
I HATE it when unnecessary deaths occur and the whole thing turned out to be based on one and that is why this book gets 3 stars instead of 4.
How is there absolutely no text evidence of Lucy and the vic talking about the guy how is it that only Lucy knows… how did he clean out the apartment in less than 40min… How did the bf not see him out back during those 25min… how did does one think of an idea as silly as the vic’s to avenge … what exactly… her childhood misery? Was it all because of the guy? Blaming him for all of her daddy’s mistakes and for him leaving her… well ok that makes sense… what about the stalker that turned out to be a “deadend” for us reader? What about the gang guy slash Rachel? We get all panicky for something happening to her in her house and his off hand comment about her useless security system and for WHAT… We never hear back from the journalist and we don’t see how that affects them later one or how the whole thing turns out after it’s settled with the gaff that’s kind of annoying I mean out of all the dragging out useless parts we don’t get this..
I’m gonna stop talking about why it should be 2 stars and talk about why it deserves more and it’s that it felt real. Even though I talk about how annoying the details and unnecessary scenes are and how much they take up parts in the book, they actually give it a better sense of timeline that helps us ¬¬-_s’integerer_ in the book and be part of it. The animosity between the squad, the women problems in the field, the character’s background and routines all feel so real and give the book another flaire and makes it so easy to just get lost in the book and wanting more.
Great book 3.5/5
"
"(spoiler) Thank goodness for the gaffer in this case. He really pulls it out of his hat, calls it, has their backs, in the end. You'll understand when you get to the last 10 pages. This story had me frustrated to no end ... I was confused enough by a couple of things, to turn the corners down. I was frustrated by how off the wall some of the stories the Ds came up with were - how unlikely some of the vic's behavior was. I was almost getting an upset stomach in the last 50 pages, anticipating that the truth would not get out - so although I felt like I was slogging through a good deal of the over 400 pages - it ended up being suspenseful. Antoinette is not your sassy murder D - she's got a mouth on her and balls - savagely tough. In a good way. Haha. I love the teams that Tana makes and that they go through all these second guesses and trauma during their solves.

French uses the primary detectives past history parallel to the vic's, once again. She continues to do an awesome job of describing the process of penciling in, flushing out the truth from a high level or rough sketch to the details. She captures the shapeshifting mental states of the detectives through paranoia, fist bumps, giddiness, and exhaustion. The atmosphere and relationships within the department, procedures and expectations seemed more detailed in this Dublin Murder Squad.

At first I did not ""get"" the title, The Trespasser, or at least, even now it's not really clear who the
Trespasser was. Using the legal definition of entering someone else's property illegally, I thought McCann was the specific trespasser. When looking at ALL the definitions (see below), all sorts of offenses, persons going too far, intrusions, demands are being made. Some, like McCann make the last, ultimate trespass - but prior to that he was going beyond others' boundaries. The vic was trespassing IMO and the female D was an interloper in the department. Her father was a trespasser. When you look at the broader definition and consider that trespassing can mean crossing boundaries we have to protect our internal worlds - trespassers come out like stars.

Interestingly enough, the rare and obsolete definitions (to go, to commit an offense, to wrong) create the foundation for the later physical harm, murder. The network of cause is murky and shifting while the legal and more physical effects are clear and substantial.

(intransitive, now rare) To commit an offence; to sin.  [quotations ▼]
(transitive, obsolete) To offend against, to wrong (someone).  [quotations ▼]
(intransitive) To go too far; to put someone to inconvenience by demand or importunity; to intrude.
to trespass upon the time or patience of another
(law) To enter someone else's property illegally.
(obsolete) To pass beyond a limit or boundary; hence, to depart; to go.  [quotations ▼]"
"I'm a little disappointed, on completing this, that I've now read all of the current books in this series. They've been that good. This one may not quite rise to the level of Faithful Place or Broken Harbor, my two favorites from the series, but it's just behind and a fair site better than the last one, The Secret Place.

This book actually features the same two detectives from ""Secret"". The only reason it's not an exception to the ""every book different"" routine French has set up in the series is that, in that book, our POV is the ""still-wet-behind-the-ears"" Moran. In this book, he's switched to the prickly Antoinette Conway. Conway, a mixed-race woman, is admittedly not the most loved figure in the squad.

Conway comes with a giant sized chip on her shoulder. The only one she trusts is Moran, who has been her partner since joining the squad. She's been teaching him the ropes and trusts him. The problem is she's burned out. Now, they get assigned a case at the end of their night shift that looks like a domestic assault gone bad. The oddity is that the Gaffer (the slang for the Captain) assigns them the golden boy of the squad to assist with the interrogations. That smells a bit odd, and Conway and Moran decide to try to keep him away from it. Breslin, on the other hand, keeps finding ways to worm his way back in.

As things spiral, it becomes clear there is something wrong with pinning the murder on the obvious suspect: the boyfriend who was supposed to be having dinner with her that night. But...if someone else did it, why did they turn off the stove instead of hoping the house burned to destroy the evidence? God is in the details in writing and criminal investigations.

French, once again, blows me away with plotting, writing, and most importantly the characterization in this book. Every character is pitch perfect throughout the story. The plot is so seamless that I sometimes forgot it wasn't about what was happening to the characters but about the murder case. But the bones of the case tie together everything that's happening. It's a double helix that ties up tight by the end of the book.

I can't recommend strongly enough that you read these if you like ""police procedural"" mysteries. These have an Irish twist to them, but they're among the best procedurals out there!"
"I enjoyed this installment of the Murder Squad. One of my favorite items about this series is that you don't need to have read any of the other books in the series to understand the one you're currently in. If you do, you might see a character you recognize. If you don't, you may see a mention of a character you might recognize later. Anyway, in The Trespasser, we get to know more of Antoinette Conway and her Partner Steve in the Murder Squad. Particularly, how difficult it can be sometimes, yes even in 2017-it happens, to be exposed to workplace discrimination and harassment. Notice that I did not say victim. You can either choose to be a victim or not. Conway says NOPE to the victim role and does her 'feckin' (nods to the Irish community) job anyway, because she loves it and refuses to give in to the drama. I was in a male dominated career in the AF in the 90's, whoever created this character did a bang up job! Some people say that they don't like her ""strong language"" or ""lack of emotion"", all I can say to this is: ""when in Rome"" & ""still waters run deep"". Back to the story, a young woman is found dead in her apartment. She was apparently getting ready for a dinner date that she was pretty excited about. She was dressed up, house was beautiful, so was she, everything perfect. Texts to her best friend...she thinks this guy might be ""the one""! So the next morning when a man calls a police station (instead of 999) (Europes version of 911), and leaves a message with an officer that when he left his girlfriends house ""she had hit her head, but he's not sure if she's alive or not, because he got scared and left her there,"" they instantly send out a team. Of course they find the worst. She is dead, having been hit very hard in the face and having the back of her head bashed in against the fireplace. So Conway & Steve think this will be pretty by the book. The boyfriend right? Not if you know Tana French, because basically... what would be the point of this book? So off we go with French throwing us some juicy clues ( historical) and even juicier ( red herrings ?) Towards the end Antoinette starts suspecting everyone, even her old friend & partner Steve! Some tense moments waiting to see how this one plays out , that's for sure! Love the characters as usual. So far, my fave character= Antoinette! She HAS to be a BAMF to get out of bed every day and pound out her frustrations on her morning runs to go in and kick more A$$ at her Job as a D in the Murder Squad. Then reign it all in to go have a pint with her friends, give her mum a supportive call, or put her Da back in the black box he belongs in, buried in the graveyard with the rest of her solved cases in the back of her mind. "
"This was exactly what you expect from Tana French:  a dark twisty mystery wrapped up in some very in depth character study of the lead detectives.  No detective has been as completely screwed up as Rob Ryan, but Antoinette gives him a run for it.  I had a hard time with her, being SO abrasive and SO sure the entire world was out to get her.  Maybe my perspective is different because I am also the only woman in my department because I'm in a male-dominated profession.  Because it was so obvious to me that the squad was not going to be as awful to her as she thought they were, just because she was a woman.  By the end of the book, she's figured that out, too, which was nice, and as a result I'd like to see her and Moran in a sequel, now that she is over being a perpetual victim.

The plot (because I will forget): a beautiful woman, Aislinn Murray, has been found dead from blunt force trauma to the head because her head slammed into her fireplace a few times.  Her best friend is cagey with the detectives and clearly keeping something back. Conway knows she's seen the vic before, and she finally remembers 
it was while she was in Missing Persons, this woman's father had gone missing when she was a girl.  A few wrong turns and dead ends and more digging, and they find out that a fellow murder detective, McCann, was also in Missing Persons back then, and he worked on that case.  And, this part is really a spoiler:  as an adult, Aislinn was determined to find out what really happened to her father, so she decides to transform herself and seduce McCann to find out what he knows; she's successful, and she discovers that he did find her father, shacked up with another woman in England, and he chose to lie to her and her mother about it ""for her own good"" and she is INCENSED because  now her father is dead and it's too late for her to reconnect, he stole that opportunity from her, so she decides to ruin his life in return by enticing him into having an affair with her, and her plan was to dump him after he leaves his wife.  But she met Rory before that could happen, and she really liked Rory, so she called things off with McCann, and ... he hit her ,and killed her, and Conway and Moran and their gaffer, O'Kelly, get a confession from McCann.  I'd love to see how that all falls out.  Ms French, please write a sequel soon!

Who is ""The Trespasser""? I suppose it's McCann, who walked into Aislinn's home while she was getting ready for a dinner date w/ Rory.

I listened to the audiobook, which was wonderfully read by Hilda Fay.  In the US, we say Moran as ""more-ANN"" but in Ireland they say ""MORE-un"" so it sounds almost like ""moron.""

Detectives Antoinette Conway & Stephen Moran"
"4 stars

For plot setup, just check the blurb. It is a good one and you will be given a good idea of what the book is all about.

There was not much here I disliked, so I'll just go over a few main points:

- Our MC is not likable. Antoinette is a tough and rough woman, has no time or patience for anyone's bull, and is growing increasingly paranoid. I adored her from the get-go, but she's my type of character. It may be somewhat trope-y, the tough girl that is only protecting her somewhat sensitive inner core, but it is done well here. Though she can rub a lot of people the wrong way, our trusty sidekick Steve is there to make things more palatable - both for readers and every other character in the book. Their dynamic is fantastic; balanced, realistic and incredibly well developed. Steve is not a doormat and it never felt like his presence was a convenient way to make everything less crude, it just absolutely makes sense that things would work out that way.

- On that note: a lot jumps off-page. I laughed out more than once, I could feel myself doing what the characters were doing (little twitches and movements), a knot would rise in my stomach when I just knew things were about to go bad. Even minor characters have quirks and feel fleshed out (takers for book 7? Gaffney?). It is immersive, and that only happens when the writing is really, really good.

- That tremendously good writing is probably what makes the first half of the book not a slog. This is not the most procedural-y of procedurals nor a true page turner, we are not thrown a whole bunch of details on forensics, there is just a bit of crime timeline action and piecing together multiple clues, there isn't a plot twist every 50 pages... The beginning is slow-ish and if you are not sold on our MC I imagine it not being the most pleasant first 300-page read ever (despite the absolutely wonderful interrogation scenes, which I believe will appeal to everyone). It is, however, a very rewarding psychologically driven read, and masterfully constructed, so I never felt bored. To a certain extent it almost felt a bit like contemporary fiction, in which it was not so much about the mystery itself as it was about what was being explored around it.

- The true selling point here is that the author is capable or merging those two worlds together so seamlessly, that by the time you're finished there is a big beautiful bow binding the whole story together. And I don't mean it in a nauseating, fairy tale way. Quite the contrary - everything makes sense, the mystery merges with the psychology, the mistakes made by the characters (and there are quite a few of them) are consistent with who they are - it is as realistic as it gets. Plus, once you pass the 300-page mark, everything flies by, you are stuck in a whirlwind of events pulling you closer and closer to the truth. I must say that if the whole book was like its last third I would probably see it as a superficial and basic mystery read, but the build up and the construction of the case and the characters make it feel everything but.

- The star for perfection would have been a more paced last third of the book. I understand why it was done, and I suppose it made a lot more people love it, but it felt a bit rushed and I was craving more detail. Especially because I will miss these characters.

There is a review somewhere that says Tana Frech is not a great mystery writer, she is a great writer, period. And I agree. It was my first time reading her work in English, and I am forever sold."
"What never fails to impress in Tana French's books is how good she is at misdirection. And she's not doding it as a narrator, rather as doubt within the characters' own minds. Often we get detectives in mystery fiction who are never less than 100% sure of their own thought processes, who have little internal life (or a pro-forma one where they're a Hard-Drinking-Guy-Nursing-A-Secret-Sorrow or a Cop-Just-on-the-Verge-of-Retirement-Who's-Seen-a-Lot and none of that really disturbs their detecting acumen; there's never any self-reflection and doubt).

French's characters are nothing if not conflicted and full of angsty or furious uncertainty. It makes for a great technique to throw the reader off the scent, as we flail about along with the characters. Cues for WhoDunnit are thrown their way and their own biases and apprehensions and prejudices affect the weight they give the evidence and we're pulled along in the gravity of this all-too-human misdirection -- and worse still, it's self-inflicted by the characters.

Grow up poor in Dublin and shit on by the richies? Then your detective work is going to either be prejudiced against the rich and French will stack the evidence in such a way that your class hatreds influence who you see as suspects. That smarmy prick in the Beemer who seems so callous about the death of a child and who has no alibi for that night is just the right fit. But if you grew up poor and a striver, you overlook the richies because it couldn't possibly be someone from the class you long to join; it has to be the lower class scum you're rising above.

It's a neat narrative trick and it feels much more authentic than Poirot pulling a rabbit out of a hat in the final scene because everyone knows that the island of Mallorca is rich in limestone deposits and mais oui c'est très facile, the governess could not have etc. etc.

French is also not afraid of leaving loose threads and unresolved issues in her mysteries because that too is more natural, is it not?

If there is one weakness in French's style it's a certain repetitiveness in character quirks. I think it was the second or third book in this series where every character said ""Fair play on ya"" around 40 times, and in The Trespasser, one of our main's, and our narrator, Atoinette spends so much of the novel up her own arse thinking people are out to get her that even we, the faithful readers, want to tell her to shut the fuck up and get back to work.

Yes, we get it, the Squad doesn't see you as one of the lads. That's understood. Now can you just get on with investigating?

But this, too, is life."
"The Likeness is still my favorite in this series, but this is a close second. 4.4 stars.

Antoinette Conway (from The Secret Place) takes the lead in this book. She is on murder and partnered up with Stephen Moran (narrator from The Secret Place). I love their partnership. I love that French doesn't try and make it a cheep romance. Conway is the paranoid, cynical one. Moran is the friendly dreamer and they just WORK together.

Conway started out in murder on the wrong foot when she slapped down a coworker sexually harassing her. This is something all women have dealt with. Do you laugh off the sexual harassment (killing a piece of your dignity) to avoid workplace awkwardness, or do you put the man in his place, and maybe face being ostracized? Conway chose the second. Then, pages from her witness statements go missing. People break into her desk. Everywhere she looks, she sees people whispering about her, eying her, looking for ways to ruin her. It's hard to know how much of that is true, and how much is her just looking for her team being out to get her. When her boss hands her an easy domestic case, she feels it was a slap to make her work a bullshit case.

What starts out as an easy domestic, is soon muddied by some shaky evidence, plus a memory Conway has that she knows the victim. Soon, she starts seeing possible gang connections, maybe a crooked cop, anything but the open and shut ""the boyfriend did it"" everyone is trying to lead her towards. Throw in a teammate who seems desperate to lead her straight to the boyfriend. Moran, the dreamer, has created numerous fantastical stories about how the murder happened. Secret drug gang boyfriend, perhaps? Next thing you know, Conway starts seeing a shadowy figure staking out her house.

Conway is the perfect narrator. She feels everyone is out to get her, for good reason. She doesn't know if people are trying to lead her towards the boyfriend to cover something up, or lead her toward a wrong path to make her look the fool. She is sarcastic, witty, and strong. She is hard at times. She can alienate people, but frankly, it makes me love her more. She is a woman I would look up to.

Even if you don't read this whole series, I strongly suggest The Likeness and The Trespasser. Possibly because I am totally sexist and love a strong female lead, but mostly because the characters and stories she has built lead you on an amazing journey."
"Recently, I've been doing a thing where I'll read a book without first looking at any reviews or in-depth synopses. I'll check out books based on if I think the title sounds interesting, like the cover art, have read the author before, or if a book's generating a lot of buzz. I'll read the blurb, although usually by the time my hold is available I've forgotten what it's about. I've found that when I read too many reviews (good and bad) and too much background about a book (or god forbid accidentally read a spoiler) I go into it with preconceived notions and biases rather than just enjoying it/not enjoying it and forming my own opinion. Avoiding all the crap ahead of time makes me read things I might otherwise not pick up and I usually end up liking those ones best.

Anyway, this is all relevant because while I loved the first four Dublin Murder Squad books, I was NOT a fan of The Secret Place. The changing POVs and bouncing between first and third person was distracting, the story wasn't interesting, and most importantly, I didn't like the two main detectives. Conway was a caricature and Moran was just flat out boring.

I checked out The Trespasser because it was available and I figured I give the series another go. I didn't read anything about it. I'm glad I didn't, because lo and behold the main detectives are Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran again! Had I known that before, this book would have just stayed on my To Read shelf for an eternity. I will admit, when I noticed who the main characters were I wasn't super invested in continuing reading. It took me longer than normal to get into it. Moran is still pretty bland, but it's not so bad since he's not the main character. This is Conway's story. I was then even less interested when I realized that.

I continued reading, however, and fortunately being in Conway's head is a lot more interesting than being in Moran's was. She's still not the most likable character, but you end up understanding (and even empathizing, wow) with her points of view and why she came off as such a hardass in The Secret Place.

Once I got past my issues with the characters, I really enjoyed the Trespasser. It read more like the first four books - all first person, no changing POVs, no pack of teenagers to try and keep track of. There were a lot of twists and turns and misdirection, up until nearly the very end you were questioning who did it and what exactly happened the night Aislinn Murphy died."
"Wow, another good one from Tana French. It's a bittersweet moment because I enjoyed the book so much that I had to finish it and find out the real story behind the murder. However, ending it means that I've finished all of the books in the Dublin murder series. Since starting with ""In The Woods,"" I've grown attached to each of the detectives from all the novels and the side characters that aren't just placeholders, but three dimensional and more than what meets the eye. I've become immersed with the Irish landscape and setting that Tana creates that I can't imagine a world without being a part of the story. So, now that it's over, I don't know what to do or who to read next. I know that it won't top the experience I've had with this book series.

""The Trespasser"" focuses on detective Antoinette Conway. She was featured in a less prominent role in the last book, ""The Secret Place."" Right as I started reading this book, I liked her narrative immediately. Yes, she's a tough chick, but more than that, she's a human being and her reasons for reacting so sarcastically and gruffly come from being judged by her peers and experiencing harassment in the workplace with little to no support from anyone on the staff, including the gaffer. Being a minority in any environment can be difficult and I can relate to how she feels isolated, alone, and a little paranoid. Her reasons are valid. This novel focuses more on the Dublin murder squad as a whole, which is a little different than the other companion books. It also gives us some insight into the gaffer, who's been featured to some extent in each book.

The murder of Aislinn Murray, on the surface, seems like a domestic. Conway's colleagues (except for her partner, Steve Moran) seem convinced that Aislinn's date is the killer. However, looks deceive and there's more going on to this investigation. Various different angles are explored and just when you think you know what's going to happen, they throw a curveball in there that turns the story upside down. I didn't know who the killer was up until the reveal of new information that changes the way Aislinn has been perceived this entire time. Still, it was a riveting and intense story. Things are resolved in a very realistic way. It's too bad that Tana doesn't revisit (for the most part) detectives because I'd be curious to read more about Antoinette's next adventures, along with Moran's. Oh well. It's definitely worth a read."
"we all know that i worship the ground tana french walks on. all of her books have been 4-5 stars for me and something about the way that she writes always just gets me. it’s just so beautiful and real and raw and like thoughtful i LOVE ITanyways, about this book in specific. i loved it. i love antoinette i think she’s so badass and i really admire how she doesn’t take any shit from anybody. while we see her kind of losing her cool, she gets so paranoid about all the other no detectives being against her that it kinda clouds her decisions and makes the case way tougher for her, i liked it. i think it made her more human, in a situation like that where she’s always the odd one out because she’s a woman of color in a white man’s club so to speak i think it’s easy to feel like everyone is against you because that’s probably how is always been for her. idk i’m an antoinette apologist and she can do no wrong to me. she’s cool as fucki still love stephen too, their relationship is so perfect and they make such a good team i love it. breslin was annoying as fuck, mccann is gross i hate him, rory was kind of a pussy but i lowkey felt bad for him, and aislinn was batshit crazy tbh (even tho u shouldn’t speak ill of the dead)i loved the interrogation scenes, you’d think they’d be boring since it’s literally just people sitting in a room talking but i thought they were so interesting. i also liked seeing how the hierarchy in the squad played out, with breslin being the bigger detective trying to control antoinette and stephen, with o’kelley ultimately being the one to get mccann to confess it all. shoutout o’kelley i love that he was the one to take the responsibility of dealing with mccann so antoinette and stephen wouldn’t lose their spots in the squad, that slayed of him.major tea of a detective having been the killer, and of aislinn having been manipulating him the whole time for info about her dad’s case. i didn’t expect that tbh even when they were alluding to it having been a cop. i knew it wasn’t rory but i didn’t really expect mccann. good job miss tanahere is my final (😭) ranking of the dublin murder squad series after a ton of thought:1. the likeness 2. broken harbor3. the trespasser4. the secret place5. in the woods6. faithful placetana please write more books PLEASE"
"Listened to the audiobook and really glad I did. I typically prefer reading the text myself but listening to the narrator go through the dialogue was incredible.

I struggled in the beginning as Antoinette came off as aggressive and always on the offensive. I realize not all women or women in fiction must be perfect and likable but I would likely still have trouble sympathizing with this personality if it belonged to a man. Throughout the book there were moments where I could feel Antoinette's anger and resentment ooze through. I could understand her rage, but also found her quite grating at times. Mostly when she came off as totally heartless, such as during the scene where she remembers the first time she encountered Aislin. The whole ""I don't give a shite how much this life altering and tramautic event causes you pain, I have things to get done"" attitude and general unhelpfulness is probably why most people around the world hate the police. It makes sense that French would pair her with Stephen, who in the words of Austen is ""most agreeable"" and serves as the poster boy for their partnership. He may be boring but he's someone I want to see succeed. I'm glad I was able to get a better sense of his personality although it was overshadowed by the behemoth that is Conway.

The plot and story really starts to move rapidly in the second half of the book so it's worth the slog through the back and forth between the initial theories and the endless bullying toward Rory. I get it. The Murder Squad ain't for the fainthearted, but in this book, the Murder Squad strikes me as downright toxic. I should add I was happy to see Sam O'Neil (yay) seems to still be working there.. I was waiting for a nod to Cassie at some point but that never happened (boo).

As I was nearing the final scenes of the book, I had chills up my spine. The conversations that happen within the police station are some of the most intense that I remember reading in French's other books. I was reminded of the emotional weight and intensity of the talks Frank Mackey has with his brother and how the case is solved but the ending isn't really happy.

This was a great book, and I'm hoping Ms. French can treat us with another story within the Murder Squad... perhaps a short story series following various characters around?? Like Cooper?? That guy is terrible and fascinating."
"I enjoyed it overall (hence the 4 stars) but it wasn't mind-blowing or particularly traumatizing and all-encompassing as some of French's other novels are. Antoinette's core struggle is that she is a girl and feels that everybody is out to get her, but I feel like her demons are mostly brushed aside or muted in contrast to the actual detective mystery. A much larger focus seems to rest on the dilemma between Antoinette and Stephen vs Breslin as they try to circumvent him. In that sense, it almost feels like Antoinette and Stephen are amateurs 
and even by the end of the novel, when they have discovered the whole mystery, O'Kelly is the one who officially closes the case.

The mystery itself is good but again, not extremely memorable. I still love the detail in the detective aspect, with the instructions to floaters on measuring the pacing/timing, uncovering the list of associates, etc. But otherwise, I felt like the actual mystery of this was relatively small and enclosed with very few possible suspects 
and the outcome was relatively predictable between Breslin and McCane and tbh I didn't really care between the two of them. The victim/associated characters were also a tad weak (from a personality perspective) which didn't make me particularly sympathetic to them and their story.

Finally, there was also this random tangent: I didn't like it. 
The return of Antoinette's dad was just a bit random, unbelievable, and just overall unnecessary. It just seems way too coincidental that this moment is when her dad arrives and the whole creepy/stalker vibe leading up to his appearance was completely unnecessary. Sure, it added some suspense to the mystery but the eventual reveal as her father was a complete letdown when it had nothing to do with the mystery and Antoinette pretty much just blew him off.

But overall, with all the bad aside, I did still love the detective qualities of this book and the friendship between Antoinette and Stephen. Watching detectives work the interview room will never get old and I just loved the many levels of this mystery."
"This book was an exercise in frustration.

I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. At 65% of the way through, I was going to rate this lower. And then I got to the end, and of course that changed everything.

Antoinette Conway’s entire life is about stories, one way or another, and this book is her battle to be the protagonist of her own. She wants to be Wonder Woman and go at the world alone — and this book goes into every layer of what that really means. Hers isn’t an easy head to live in. Conspiracies lurk in every corner and she’s constantly facing belittlement and harassment (not to mention a double whammy of sexism and racism). So it’s no wonder that she’s no angel or empath herself.

The real reason why I deducted a star was because there was a LOT of 
victim-blaming in this. I absolutely understood why, especially by the end, but it didn’t make it any easier to read about 
a woman literally beaten to death and how her naivety made it her fault. I’d definitely caution someone going into this series about those topics, just in case.

I feel like the middle three books of this series took us out of the squad room, but The Trespasser brought us right back in and I loved that. I feel like I got to know Steve a lot better through Antoinette’s eyes than his own, and it was great to see her takes on O’Kelly (and Sam!!!!).

This book is about people needing people, and people not needing people, and how that twists everything in a person’s head. I love that. I love Aislinn (probably my favourite victim [weird thing to say but oh well] in the whole series or at least tied with Lexie). I love Steve and Antoinette’s partnership, I loved how she changes (not softens, never softens), and I LOVE SO MUCH how a particular plot point about her personal life plays out. And so while sometimes, Antoinette made me want to put this book down and/or pull my hair out, by the end I could only admire how unapologetically herself Tana French wrote her. Antoinette’s isn’t an easy or fun story to read, but it’s so worth it."
"I've really come to enjoy Tana French & the Dublin Murder Squad series.
This was a pretty good final installment into the series. As a woman, I can say that I do know what it is like to be looked down upon by a group of men. I think Conway's perspective was well-portrayed, although I know some people were annoyed by it. Yes she was paranoid at times but I could relate to her thought process.
Sometimes I feel like the details are too much and I want to just get on with it, but with French, I literally just get blissfully lost in the story and lose track of time. She does a great job with the play-by-plays without making it tedious.
As far as the mystery goes, it wasn't jaw-dropping or earth-shattering. But the ultimate reveal was satisfying. 
A D on the squad, McCann was shagging the victim. She was manipulating his life just like he manipulated hers by not telling her where her missing da was when she was a little girl. He caught her preparing a romantic dinner for another man and she told him to fuck off so POW, he punched her lights out. And then Breslin aka asshole smooth talker cop came in to try to help cover it all up.

The biggest and most thought provoking theme of this one is how our inner realties color how we view the world, what we believe is what we see and what we look for and what we convey to others. One person's reality doesn't necessarily match anothers. And in this way, life is subjective. Conway was annoying at times when she thought the world was out to get her - and FINALLY reached the conclusion that her own paranoia was contributing to self-sabotage. But this idea of self-fulfilling prohecies and self-sabotage and ego etc was explored in other characters as well. As a detective, it can both be an asset and a deterrent to solving a case.
As people, we all try to live up to the stories in our heads, and try to force our beliefs into reality. It's an interesting concept to ponder.

I'm glad Tana has continued to write after this series and I forward to diving into her other works."
"Detective Antoinette Conway of the Dublin Murder Squad has always wanted to bag a high-profile criminal . . . not the “drunk assholes” or doltish boyfriends and husbands that dominate her domestic murder cases, but rather an intelligent killer who puts her mettle to the test. Enter Aislinn Murray, a beautiful victim whose murder appears cut and dry—it’s her new boyfriend Rory, right? But after some investigation, 32-year-old Conway and especially her Boy Scout of a partner Steve Moran think that more sinister forces may be at work. Smooth-talking senior detective Breslin, brought onto the case by the head of police to babysit the partners, complicates things by wanting to throw the book at Rory. It isn’t long before the reader discovers French’s knack for keeping the reader guessing about suspects’ guilt or innocence.

In this sixth installment of her Murder Squad series (also readable as a standalone novel), French gains sympathy for Conway by introducing the challenges she faces as the only female in a squad teeming with chauvinists, many of whom want her out. They harass her. They talk about her behind her back. One even urinates in her locker. But the feisty Conway holds her own and doesn’t take “shite” from anyone, whether he be a stalker or a misogynist. Throughout the novel, Conway must restrain herself despite her strong desire to kick in the teeth of various male antagonists. Also interesting is Conway’s parallel history to Aislinn in that both women’s fathers disappeared when they were girls.

One of the novel’s greatest strengths is its depiction of ultra-long interrogation scenes. Rarely does the tension flag as first-person narrator Conway shares her tactics and comments on what she’s offering or withholding and why. Getting interviewees to talk can be a complicated dance. Hilda Fay’s Irish accent in the audiobook version lends the story a certain authenticity. “Hypothetical” becomes “hypotetical” and “thirty” sounds like “tirty.” It all builds to a tense, minutely detailed final interview that takes more than 45 minutes in audiobook version.

"After the difficult books I've been reading (Autumn-The Witch Elm), a almost straighforward mystery was in order and needed. A good book, clever, crisp, tight, Tana French has not failed.

Critics
The bestselling novel by Tana French, author of The Witch Elm, is “required reading for anyone who appreciates tough, unflinching intelligence and ingenious plotting” (The New York Times). She “inspires cultic devotion in readers” (The New Yorker) and is “the most important crime novelist to emerge in the past 10 years” (The Washington Post).

“Atmospheric and unputdownable.” —People
In bestselling author Tana French’s newest “tour de force” (The New York Times), being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"
"My autistic kiddo is upstairs moaning, pacing, and flicking his ViewMaster at top speed clickety clickety clickety clicking. Usually I'm able to zone things like that out once I'm sure everything is ok but tonight I'm having trouble concentrating and will keep this short and shallow. There's tons of good reviews out there so this one is for future Susan, in case she has forgotten what she thought about The Trespasser. Very good, police procedural mystery. As usual, French's characters are well drawn. You don't always like them but you can see and hear them in your head. Antoinette Conway is prickly, smart and cheeky to the point of coming across as rude (I love the things she thinks but doesn't say). Her partner Stephen Moran is the perfect balance for her sometimes caustic personality. Moran and Conway catch what appears to be a simple domestic murder case just as they are about to head home after a night shift. A complex and twisty mystery is what they've actually caught and I kept guessing because they keep guessing, tossing out one possibility after another, but never having quite enough to convince even themselves they're absolutely on the right track. Until they are and even then there are some things they did not see coming.

I always enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad, no exception here. I love looking up the place names after trying to figure out how to pronounce them myself, I am seldom right, but that's the fun of it, trying to sort out all those seemingly superfluous letters. I was rather delighted to see the word ""banjaxed,"" I haven't heard that in ages and ages. And once again, my usual DMS PSA - if the swears really get to you, you will find many here. My understanding, based on a college roommate, is that this is not an affectation, not intended to cause offense or just for shock value, it's really how they talk in that corner of the world."
"Well, this is my sixth Tana French novel and I've pretty much loved every new book in the Dublin Murder Squad series more than the last, so I can't say that I was ever expecting this to be anything less than fantastic. These are some pretty high expectations to live up to - and, surprisingly or not, French manages to exceed them all.

I've always liked these books primarily for their styles and settings. French is a master of dialogues and characterisation and she seems to know how to talk about Dublin and its suburbs better than anyone else. As for the mysteries themselves, while they are without question well crafted, I always felt that there was just the tiniest little something missing. It was always enough to keep me engaged, but never quite reached the ""mind BLOWN"" territory that French completely had potential for.

This time, everything works. Antoinette is a fantastic narrator, as funny in her sarcasm as she is flawed in her weariness. You can't have a biracial woman detective in a room full of Irish white men without making this at least part of her story, and French integrates the personal aspect of her protagonist's lives into the main case in such an organic way that there is no clear divide between the two. The main mystery is interesting in and of itself, but the road to get to its conclusion wouldn't be nowhere as captivating had it been told by anyone else. I'm always in awe of the way French crafts her detective characters and her mysteries so that the two merge together - everything here is calculated without feeling calculating, crafted without ever feeling anything but real. It's a rare thing, and it's absolutely great.

I wasn't against French's use of the supernatural in earlier novels but I think I like her the best in stories like these - raw, captivating and walking along the edge of reality in the best way possible. My favorite of the series so far."
"Last year I re-read In the Woods by Tana French, and now I finally decided to finish The Trespasser. I delayed it a bit because right now it’s the last book in this series. I don’t know if this is officially the last one in the series, but I really hope we’ll get another Dublin Murder Squad book in the future. I just love these books so much and this one was no exception.

In this book we follow Antoinette Conway & Stephen Moran, who also both appeared in The Secret Place, although there Stephen was the main character. This time we get to know Antoinette and her challenges in a workplace that is very hostile towards her.

While the case she and Stephen get in this book doesn’t seem remarkable at first, it turns out that there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye. Every time they think they have found a clue it doesn’t lead anywhere, their theories only seem to distract them and their fellow detective helping their case seems to be playing games with them. Antoinette has a hard time separating what is part of the actual case and what is people just messing with her. It gets to the point where she starts second-guessing everything and everyone around her and leaves her wondering who she can really trust.

When she and Stephen are finally able to let go of all the distractions and their theories, they finally are able to see what has been in front of them the entire time. I was quite surprised by this reveal, as the entire book had me guessing what was really going on. 
While it became pretty obvious that Detectives Breslin & McCan were connected to the murder somehow, I never thought one of them would be in that deep. I also was surprised by Aislinn’s motivation. One thing that I appreciate so much in these books is that French is really able to make you feel the weight and emotion of the situation, it makes the story feel so real.

Overall I really enjoyed this one, not my favorite in this series, but a very good entry."
"This was perhaps the easiest of the Dublin Murder books to read, a thing both good and bad.

This one plus Secret Place are a fantastic friendship/partnership arc for Antoinette and Steve: the beats of their relationship are not dissimilar to a romance (complete with the Dire Falling-Out that most be repaired before they can have their HEA). I say this because it's so rare to see this much attention spent on the ups and downs of non-romantic friendship, and I'm so grateful French has decided to devote her considerable talent for writing relationships to this. Also, Breslin is a genius depiction of a certain type of puffed-up self-righteous asshole that every office in every kind of career seems to have. From his first line of dialogue I wanted to punch him and I had two or three very particular faces in mind...

That said, Antoinette's personal and professional journey to hell and back goes a lot more smoothly than in the early installments. One might even say that some punches are pulled. This is in some ways the closest to a traditional policier:
 from the fact that our heroes *don't*, in the end, have to sacrifice their careers to see Justice done (compare Sam O'Neill's dilemma in In the Woods) to the fact that the Bad Cops are thoroughly corrupt and complete tossers to boot, to the classic day-saving ""it's all over, but at least end your career with honor"" gambit by an Authority Figure who turns out to have hidden depths and more wisdom and acumen, not to mention integrity, than we perhaps suspected. Basically, this is a late Euripides: all's (mostly) well that (mostly) ends well and the gaffer from the machine comes down to give a moral once the suffering is firmly behind us and the future clear. Don't get me wrong! I really enjoyed this qua mystery and I really enjoyed Conway qua protagonist and narrator. But it might have been a more interesting and daring novel to write from Breslin's POV."
"Again, all the highlights of a Tana French book---in-depth psychological analysis of motives, perceptions and their impact on behavior and judgment; intense interaction between partner/pair and the rest of the squad; surprising twists, right to the end; entanglements of personal history with victim and perp and understanding the psychological dynamics of the case; psychological thrilling read. This explores the mentality of working class/lower class detectives; being female in a male dominated world; abandonment by father on girls.""Being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be.

"Un polar très noir à l’atmosphère étouffante.

Il ne fait pas bon être une femme flic en Irlande. L’inspecteur Antoinette Conway a pour seul allié son équipier Stephan Moran. Tous deux se voient chargés d’une enquête à priori simple, un cas classique de violence conjugale : une jeune femme a été retrouvée morte chez elle et tout semble indiquer que c’est son petit ami, Rory, le coupable. Sauf que le commissaire leur a adjoint un inspecteur plus ancien pour les épauler, Breslin, qui va tout mettre en œuvre pour faire condamner Rory. Il va se montrer tellement insistant qu’il va éveiller les soupçons d’Antoinette dont la vie à la brigade est une succession de moqueries et humiliations de la part de ses partenaires masculins à l’exception de Stephan.

Je remercie NetGalley ainsi que les Éditions Calmann-Levy pour ce Service Presse. Depuis longtemps j’avais envie de découvrir cet auteur mais je dois avouer que je suis déçue. J’ai eu beaucoup de mal à terminer ce livre qui fait quand même plus de 500 pages. Et pendant plus de 400 pages, l’enquête piétine et surtout j’ai trouvé que le personnage principal, Antoinette, était dure, aigrie, agressive, dénuée d’empathie et de compassion. Et je ne parle même pas de l’inspecteur Breslin qui est tout à fait déplaisant. La manière dont ils voient le suspect est malsaine, irrespectueuse. Le seul qui se montre humain, c’est Stephan, le co-équipier. Par contre lorsqu’ils auditionnent le véritable coupable, tout le talent de Tana French se découvre. Le meurtrier se révèle féroce lors de son interrogatoire mais je n’ai pas pu m’empêcher d’avoir mal pour lui quand il découvre à quel point il a pu être abusé.

Nous avons donc une enquête dans laquelle nous sommes immergés et que l’auteur nous fait vivre comme si nous y étions. Elle a un don pour l’étude psychologique de ses personnages qui sont très fouillés.
"
"I skipped book #5 by accident, so I read this without experiencing the continuity of characters that come with these books.

The first half of this book nearly had me swear off Tana French entirely. Antoinette is such a deeply unlikable character initially. She is antagonistic, combative, hateful, and joyless. Convinced that everyone is out to get her, she hates everyone and everything without relent. It's exhausting to read her take down her squad, her job, her partner, herself, the victim, the suspect, and more. She is wholly unsympathetic, and therefore it's impossible to relate to her. Perhaps a testament to French's writing, she feels like someone we've all encountered in our life at some point: that person who seems to thrive and sustain themselves by wallowing in their own endless ocean of misery and negativity. This is the kind of person who when life gives her lemons, she jams them in her eyes just to have that much more to complain about.

She does come around after a tipping point, however. Once the twist is revealed, the character not only relents, but acknowledges to herself just how awful she's been. After that, the book picks up considerably, largely because the story shifts from Antoinette's awful vitriolic inner monologue to the external, broader narrative of whodunnit. It's in this later half of the narrative that French shines. Here, motives are painfully human, and while nobody's actions are excusable (or excused), they are very understandable. The villain this time isn't a psychopath or mental illness at large, but the ramifications of someone making a selfish decision that they framed to themselves as ""doing what's right,"" and how this decision rippled out to affect the lives of everyone surrounding them.

While the first half is grating, French manages to turn it around with a compelling second half and satisfying conclusion."
"3.5 stars

We first met Antoinette, the narrator of this one, in a previous book. Now she and rookie Steve are on the murder squad, but serving their apprenticeship being given the dross from the cases. When a 'real' murder is handed to them, they can't believe their luck, but the case quickly turns into something that could ruin the nascent careers of both.

I have enjoyed all of this series to different degrees, and love the different perspectives you get of the squad. This was much more a study of the dynamics of the squad and the mind of a detective than a murder, and that suited me fine. Antoinette is seriously screwed up, but how much of it is in her own head? A lot, basically, and it is very well told. Tana French doesn't hold her punches with her characters, and she gives us a woman who is clever, smart, ambitious, but so obsessed with being persecuted and stamped on that she can't differentiate any more. She lashes out, she is brutal, she makes very poor judgements, she trusts no-one. Most of it is entirely understandable. Some of it is her own fault. I love how we see her evolve, how we see the wheels of her mind turning, and how she is unable, no matter what, to back down and apologise. French is true to her character right to the end - there is no soft, fresh-washed Antoinette at the end - but there is a new, brighter, harder and incredibly strong woman. I'm not sure I'd be her friend - I doubt she'd like me - but she's a person I'd love to know.

Oh yes, and there is a rather good murder mystery going on with this book too of course! And naturally, this being Tana French, not all the ends are nicely tied up - something which I really like. Aside from the first two in the series which you have to read in order, you can mix and match this series. And if you haven't read any, I'd recommend it.
"
"Antoinette Conway has moved up to the murder squad after proving her mettle in missing persons, but all is not rosy for the young, single detective. She's the only woman, and the target of misogynistic harassment, deceptive journalism, and suppressed information, not from suspects or witnesses, but from her own squad. As she and her partner, Steve, the one person she feels she can trust, work on their latest domestic violence murder, she begins to question whether her point of view might be skewed.
I loved the complicated story that Tana French wove in this novel. She has fully developed characters with complex histories, each motivated by past injustice, and trying to move forward. The one character I detested was Breslin, another detective on the squad, whose entitled, condescending, and threatening attitude toward Conway made me wish someone would cut him off at the knees. His blatant manipulation of Antoinette and Steve, as well as his own boss and the less experienced officers working the case, made me furious. It also bothered me that he'd get to Antoinette, who's narration shared the story with the reader. Her lack of confidence left her questioning whether or not he was right.
Throughout the investigation, various narratives were being shared, usually pruned to fit what the witness hoped would be the outcome, and poor Antoinette and Steve were left to sort through these stories, searching for the truth, trying to discover what really happened to Ashlyn, a young, beautiful woman who was killed while putting on the finishing touches for a romantic dinner with a new beau. Her story, also, was much more complicated than it first appeared.
Ultimately, though, I felt very satisfied with the ending, although my comfort had to wait until the very end, and French kept me twisting with the unfairness of it all to the final moments."
"The Trespasser is book 6, and the final book in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. I don't have a definite favorite of the 6 books, but this and the second book (Likeness) are the two I probably enjoyed the most.
Like book 2, The Trespasser feels more together and complete, and it's possibly because both books are clearer ""sequels"" of the books before. The main character (first person) in this is Antoinette Conway, who was a sort of partner to Stephen Moran in The Secret Place. They swap and we see the world more from Conway's perspective. She's decidedly more paranoid than Stephen, and some people might find her difficult to like as a character, but I thought she was great. Prickly and unwilling to take any crap from the other detectives in Murder, she had spent quite a while looking over her shoulder for various types of sabotage - her paranoia wasn't completely unwarranted.
She and Moran are both instantly suspicious when their gaffer brings them a case right before their shift ends, but they end up invested in it almost immediately, especially since another lead detective is along with them to help interview witnesses and they don't really understand why there's anything special about what should be a fairly cut and dry domestic violence case.
I found the side characters to be interesting - the suspects had good creepiness, even those who didn't end up being guilty, the victim had a good backstory, including what led to her death.
Again, the author writes a lot of the emotional and mental pieces well. Conway's tension, and her distrust of her squad feels realistic, as does her relief, when she connects the dots and some areas feel more resolved.
The story wrapped up and was satisfying in the end - and I wish there were going to be more books in this series with other characters.

"
"Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are partners in the murder squad now. Whilst their working together is going well, the tension between Antoinette and the rest of the squad is climbing. They pull in a case that looks like a straightforward domestic violence, with a clear suspect. As another detective pushes them to take the obvious solution but something is nagging at Conway and Moran, telling them there is more to this than meets the eye. The question is, is it smoke and mirrors to try and push Conway out, or is there really something to it?

After the Secret Place I was a little put off this series, that one took a bit of a strange turn that I didn't really enjoy. I don't like leaving things unfinished though so after a bit of a break it was time to dive back in. I can happily say this one returns to more of French's normal style, and I enjoyed it significantly more.

Despite having met Antoinette in the previous book, I found her hard to like at the start of this one. It's easy to see why she is the way she is, especially at work, I can't imagine being faced with colleagues who actively try and disrupt your work to push you out. I did wonder if she let that spill over in to other aspects of her life though.

The plotline for this is a slow burn, which isn't really a surprise with the length of the book. There's a lot of detail and layers to the story, so despite it being long it doesn't drag out.
French has written this in such a way that you question everyone at times, some of them in whether they are telling the truth and some of them in terms of their judgement. It means that you really aren't sure who to trust and who to suspect.

A great way to round out the series, which apart from book 5 was a steller set of books to read. They will definitely be featuring in my re-reads down the line."
"Tana French, you may recall, ever so slightly but nevertheless noticeably was off her game with her last book, ""The Secret Place"". I hate to actually state that it was disappointing, but...it was. Nothing worked, not the murder, the setting, the characters. And it wasn't just because I was experiencing separation pangs from Frank Mackey, French's fabulously accessible and hardened detective, who was only a minor character in this one. No, it was that, and I have to admit it, the book was just not all that good. And if I'm being honest, ""Broken Harbor"" was also only okay. In fact, it's the Mackey storyline that saves it. So it was with hope and trepidation that I read this latest offering by French, and I am happy (and relieved) to report that she is back. Mostly. While it still doesn't scale the heights of ""Faithful Place"" and ""The Likeness"" which remain my two favorites, it does accomplish what recent outings have not, which is a taut storyline that will keep you guessing to the end, along with French's wonderful writing. Although there is a seemingly unnecessary and distracting minor plot line involving Conway's own parentage, it does not distract from the deceptively straightforward and inevitably highly complex murder of a single woman who, on the surface, is not involved with anything nefarious, and then of course through investigation is found to have been. Add to that French's unceasing and compelling layer of office politics that encompasses class issues, gender issues, and of course good old-fashioned cop issues, and you have a murder mystery that once again befits French. Maybe next time Mackey can at least make a cameo appearance, but barring that, it's good to have French back and almost at the top of her game."

Antoinette Conway, Dublin Murder Squad Detective, who we met in the previous novel, is the Chief Detective in this book, as well as the first person narrator. Her partner, Steve Moran, who had a small but very important role in book three, was the narrator of the previous one.

It seems very simple, the two are finishing an all-nighter after a late Saturday night, when a new case is phoned in. A twenty-six year old woman is found dead in her home and the obvious suspect is her new boyfriend, who claims he was invited to dinner, but she never answered her door or phone, so, disappointed, he went home.

That’s where the simplicity ends, and the reader is treated with more than 400 pages of complex complications until a satisfactory ending is achieved.

This was the sixth and last of the Dublin Murder Squad novels in a row (so far) for me, and I Googled Tana French as I finished this and was delighted to discover that a new novel is scheduled for the fall.
I also found an unrelated book, The Witch Elm, (the first 55 pages online) - which I ordered from EBay this morning.

In my Obsessive/Compulsive Manner (I do not consider it a Disorder), I made a list of the new Irish Slang words I learned from this book, and I am pleased to present them here:

skanger - extremely low class person
garda - policeman
johnnies - condoms
culchie - (pejorative) a person coming from rural Ireland
KAs - known associates
mot - girlfriend
yoke - thing, stuff
ickle - little
tache - moustache
earwig - eavesdropper
jacks - toilet
gaffer - boss
hames - mess
eejit - idiot
panto - childhood puppet show
gaffe - house
"
"This is the third of the Dublin series that I've read and I think the best. In the first two (In The Woods and The Likeness), the protagonists were so self sabotaging and frankly mental that it made it unbelievable that they would be promoted to detectives. Antoinette is self sabotaging as well but she had reason to not trust her colleagues and I don't think it ultimately affected her ability to deduce the murderer (although I figured the married guy was a cop not a gangster before she did). There are some loose ends however. There is a descripincy between the ME's report about there being two punches and McCann's statement that he punched her only once. Maybe he was trying to make it look like manslaughter or maybe Breslin found her alive and delivered the fatal blow. We know Breslin cleaned the scene and took a long time to call it in. French deliberately pointed out the difference between what McCann told Breslin and what Breslin told O'kelley and then let it lie there unresolved. I also don't understand why Moran and Conway just let Breslin walk off with the tape of the interview when they were going to see O'kelley all along. We are also left to assume that O'kelley did the right thing. It would be the first of the Dublin novels that I've read so far that there is justice in the end. One consistent flaw in the series is the motivations of the victims and that is a big problem in this book. I don't believe for one second that Aislinn couldn't hire a pi or even go on a genealogy website and type in her father's dob and find his obituary to get the information she wanted. Seducing a detective on the off chance that he MIGHT tell her (if he even remembers a decades old missing persons case) is pretty implausible even for someone as unbalanced as Aislinn was."
"This is the sixth (and last, so far at least) of Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad novels. As with the others, the narrator here is different from the previous book(s), but in this case, we have the same pair of detectives as we had in the fifth in the sequence, The Secret Place. Antoinette Conway is the only woman in the squad at the time of the setting, and the only black person. She is being harassed constantly and trusts none of her colleagues, except maybe Stephen Moran, her partner, who narrated The Secret Place.

The problem is, even Steve she can’t bring herself to trust fully.

A young receptionist turns up dead in her own living room – another locked room mystery, although as someone points out early on, if the front door is on a Yale lock, you only have to close it and it’s latched. The victim is kind of plastic beautiful, notes Conway, working really hard to look a certain way, and her house is a spotless simulacrum of twee perfection.

I’ve read other reviews claiming the book was so full of twists and turns that it’s never what you think it’s going to be, but here I have to demur. It was exactly what (and who) I thought it would be. Maybe I’ve read too much of this genre, but the perp and their connection to the case was obvious almost from the start. That said, you don’t really read Tana French for the mystery. You read for the claustrophobic atmosphere of the squad room, the paranoia, the tension, the uncertainty about who you can trust and who’s pissing in the narrator’s locker and spitting in her tea.

It becomes unbearable at times, with long interrogation scenes that make Line of Duty seem like the twaddle it really is. I did have to look up spoilers just to settle my nerves."
"I know no one's going to read my reviews about any book, but it is not about others reading them, it's about... it's like a milestone for me to complete any book and after that reviewing that to ensure the capture of ""just after feeling"" of mine after completing any certain book.
reviews are more like expressing myself in the context of any given situation that I won't be able to express it to anyone else I know.
So!!! This book!
Amazing experience it has been, this is the first murder mystery book that I have read, and I must say it did the justice of being the first one.
Ending was so unexpecting to me as I was more concentrated about the surface parts like, was Rory the one who killed her or McCann, but it was more than that. The way Tana French played the ending was so worthwhile and fulfilling that it got me into thinking into whole another perspective from unexplored sides.
The way Breslin was with McCann the whole time and the support he showed was just something very few of us can do and can experience.
Conway felt like a bitch most of the time to me but yeah that's what got this case solved.
It may come as a very unpopular side of thought but the victim of all of this bullshit was McCann, not Aislin.
Aislin was a fucking maniac with all the things she did to our new proclaimed victim. I am not justifying the murder but that was deliriously straight up lunatic of Her's to do what she did. McCann's not telling her mom about her father was not right, but he was not being as of a nutjob as Conway portrayed him of.
Oh! btw I was so confused with those esoteric ""crime abbreviations""! They should have provided a brief elucidation of those baffling Jargons lol."
"I'm not sure how to rank this book, other than ""better than the previous book"". I think to be able to properly enjoy it you'll have to have read the last 3 books where the characters first show up, which is not usually the case. Trespasser feels less like a standalone than I'm used to. I'm not sure if it's because I can't remember enough of Antoinette and Stephen to appreciate their development, or if it's because this book manages not to shed much light on them even though they're at the center of the action. It's a lot less intimate and, weirdly enough, a lot less creepy. There's usually an unsettling thread of the supernatural in the Murder Squad novels, something off-key and inexplicable, but here everything blends together (the supernatural thing is too plausible), maybe as a consequence of Antoinette's POV. I don't mean these as criticisms, I just think that Trespasser is different in so many ways it's hard not to notice.

Personally I'm not convinced with the murderer's actions, but I did enjoy a lot of the author's choices. What I enjoyed the most was Antoinette's distance from the victim. She cycles from disdain to respect as she spirals deeper and deeper into the case, but her personal life and convictions remain intact. There's a subplot with 
Antoinette's father that I thought would be woven more tightly around the victim's because of parallels, but Antoinette doesn't waver and lose herself in the past, she ends up recovering something from the present instead. I really like her both as a character and a narrator, and I love all her conflicts."
"You tell yourself a story: your friend's comment was meant to be hurtful. Your spouse's sneakiness around his/her cellphone is evidence of an affair. ""Facts"" begin to support that story: Well, your friend hasn't contacted YOU, which surely indicates guilt. Your spouse has never acted that weird around wanting to ""surprise"" you before.Next thing, you know, your story is reality. All around you are millions of people operating under their version of reality, but that's immaterial. Yours is the one that matters. The one that's real.

Now imagine taking that process into the world of a murder investigation, where stories are theories or, perhaps, motives. It's your job of keep fitting data to theories and to discard or modify theories that don't fit. But what happens if the stories that run you are deep in your unconscious.

Sounds like heady stuff. It is, particularly for Detective Antoinette Conway, the only woman on the Murder Squad and the target of new-person-hazing...or is it a coordinated attempt to make her mess up her case enough to get her off the squad? What's the story behind the victim's transformation from a dowdy wallflower to a head-turner? Could the boyfriend's story of real love actually be a tale of obsession? Are Antoinette's colleagues helping her investigation or hindering it?

The psychological complexity and focus on storytelling appeal to this reader and keep The Trespasser from becoming a familiar investigation of murder and the possibility of corruption inside the police force. The ""whodunit"" heartbeat, however, takes second seat at times, which may be problematic for readers of crime fiction who get impatient with interiority."
"Good gaffer and satisfying ending saves it!

This was a tough read. It's mostly dialog, tedious interviews, and deadens theories. However, the reader is rewarded with persistence. Although I wouldn't say French provides a happy ending, you could call it a satisfactory conclusion. I almost gave up on this book a few times. There is not a lot to admire as the murder D squad shows it's ugly side in this book. It's hard at times to sympathize with any of the characters, including the victim.

I would have quit if I had to read one more interview with the victim's boyfriend, Rory. Tedious, pathetic and ultimately pointless as most of the interviews were (and probably about 85% of the book), the last 15% is damn good.

Without selling out or leaving things unsettled, French brings the matter to a satisfying end. I've read all of her books and I've always been an O'Kelly fan. He's a minor player in the books for sure, but his behind the scenes orchestration of the investigation always rings true. He's the puppet master that pushes his squad to perfection. The reoccurring theme in other crime novels of a corrupt administration and the maverick detective is a tired trope. In this book O'Kelly shows why he's been the head of the Murder Squad forever. It's refreshing to read a fair and fresh take on how police corruption occurs and how it ends.

Also Conway and Moran continue to make a good team, and their partnership does get tested to the limit in this one."
"Really, this rating is a 4.5. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad Series. But, saying that, I certainly have favorites. The Likeness is my most favorite, with The Secret Place coming in a close second. With The Trespasser, I found myself sinking into it more and more as I read further and further into the work. Antionette is prickly and ballsy and blunt and it takes a few minutes to love her. But, love her I did. I also continued my love of Stephen Moran that I had already developed from The Secret Place. As a duo, they work - even when you (or Antionette) are not sure they do. Being inside Antionette's head is an interesting and twisty place to be and the dialogue between all the characters is top notch. The ""bad guys"" are well-drawn and enjoyable in that bad-guy-way. The satisfaction at the end is all the more powerful because I was not sure that I would attain it.

The one question that I have been left pondering since I completed the book is: who is the trespasser? Is is Antionette? Is it the team of Conway and Moran? Is it the killer? Is it Aislinn? For me, it is an intriguing question - and one that I will continue to think about and shift my opinions.

I must say that I both listened to the audiobook and read the text. Hilda Fay gave great voice to Antionette and all the characters, but I did find that there were times I needed the words on the page to fully follow.

So, the 4.5 is simply because I still love The Likeness more. The missing .5 is not the fault of The Trespasser, it is the credit of The Likeness."
"It started as a “simple domestic.” Quickly though it turns to murder and Antoinette Conway with her partner Stephan Moran lead the investigation. The solution seems obvious: boyfriend got a bit physical. But why does it feel like a fellow detective is leading them to the quick solution? And the investigation just gets more difficult as Conway deals with the hostility of her colleagues.

It is safe to say that I will continue to pick up any new Dublin Murder Squad books. I really enjoy the Irish setting, the always-in-depth characters and the they-may-seem-secondary murder cases. With Tana French it truly is more about the characters but the murders will always intrigue. It was fantastic finally having a woman detective at the helm – and refreshing to see a portrayal of exactly how hostile some workplaces can be to women.

Narration of this audiobook was done by Hilda Fay and it was masterful. I, personally, do not have a problem with “accents” and actually prefer it when the accent seems to match the story & characters. Ms. Fay just brought the Irishness of this book to the forefront and then gently nudged readers along with her voice.

As always, I once again address the “do I have to read these in order?” The answer is no you do not. However, there is a minor something to be gained from doing so: each book’s main character was introduced in the previous volume. You won’t miss much by skipping around in the series but the bits gained on the characters can be enlightening when they become the featured detective.
"
"I took a bit of a break from reading French and I'm glad I did. If you read too much of one author, one after the other, it begins to be a bit much. Instead of taking delight I would have been bogged down by her. She spends a lot of time with her main characters and I remember getting a bit tired out with Faithful Place. But after a little palate cleanser, I'm back and I forgot how much I like her writing. She is so good at drawing you into this tangled web and keeping you hooked.
Antoinette Conway is a great character and it was really nice to get another POV character who is a woman in this series. I like female characters like Conway: she's tough and on edge because she has to be, because of her life experience. Being inside her head you get to see how much she second guesses herself and gets rattled. How she's sees arrows slinging at her every which way she looks. I could see that being tiresome to some readers, but I understood it. I know where that paranoia is coming from. I really liked her but she's complex and complicated and not the cardboard cut-out of a ""likeable"" lead. She has many rough edges.

I wasn't super shocked by the reveal, saw it's possibility come up along the way but because the characters are so well written and you're stuck inside their tangled web of thoughts and 'what ifs' it didn't bother me so much.
Can't wait to read her next one. I'm hoping we'll get another book with Conway featuring in it some way but that's usually not how these Murder Squad books work."
"French back on form.

The name Antoinette Conway is just a letter away from “Antoinette Cosway,” a.k.a pre-marriage Bertha Mason/the first Mrs Rochester in Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea. This doesn’t seem a coincidence—both women also grapple with their ambiguous racial identity and social exclusion is central to their story. The steady drip of (almost certainly racist and sexist) harassment that Antoinette Conway endures at her workplace is sadly very believable.

The mystery wasn’t all that, as I could spot the solution from a mile away —
it was so obvious that Aislinn was having an affair with a cop (why else would Lucy be scared to spill more details and why else would someone in the police room have run a search on the squeaky clean Aislinn months ago), and the “gang” theory was a herring so red it could have led a communist parade; I will admit though that I’d guessed Breslin as the beau with McCann as the unwitting accomplice rather than the other way around— but its denouement was still poignant. Pleasingly, Aislinn turned out to be spunkier than she’d seemed in most of the book, and I would have loved to see more of Lucy. (Can we please have an Antoinette/Lucy spin-off?) I was also worried that French was going to take the same inseparable-partners-blazing-row-friendship-forever-ruined route that she took in 
In The Woods , but thankfully that did not happen. The cherry on top however, is the hilarious scene where 
Antoinette’s hospitality to her estranged father takes the form of a brandished gun."
"The Dublin Murder Squad is back in book #6 of Tana French's crime series, this time featuring Detectives Antoinette Conway (from the previous book) and Stephen Moran. A beautiful young woman is found murdered in her home, and while her boyfriend would seem like the most likely suspect and pressure from the rest of the squad indicates he should be convicted, smaller details seem to indicate that maybe he's not the one. As the detectives go back and forth with their theories, they also learn more about the victim and how she's not all she seems to be on the surface.

As with all the books in this series, I enjoyed this one. However, if I was forced to choose, I think I'd say this was maybe my least favorite, though when I look at other reviews for this book, I seem to be in the minority. I can't seem to put my finger on why this one didn't appeal quite as much as the others in the series. Detective Conway has a chip on her shoulder and is constantly out to try to prove herself. I couldn't decide if I liked or disliked her character for that reason. I do think Detective Moran might be my favorite character of the whole series, however. Some might think he's too much of a softie, but I liked that about him, and he's smart. I did feel the ending was somewhat weak, and I was waiting for a bigger conclusion. This seems to be the end of this series (I think?), and that makes me sad. I still have a soft spot for Detective Rob Ryan from book #1 and would love to see him make a reappearance in some form or another. I'll keep my fingers crossed....."
"The Trespasser by Tana French is the sixth installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This one follows Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran as they investigate the murder of a squeaky clean female in her home.

Aislinn Murray was found inside her spotless home with blunt force trauma to her head. She has no known enemies and no history of any wrongdoing. Who could have possibly wanted her dead? Rory Fallon recently started seeing Aislinn and was due at her house the night she was killed, but he swears he had nothing to do with it. There's no real evidence, so Conway and Moran have their work cut out for them.

Just like all of French's novels, this one is a slow burn but once it gets going it's a pretty fast read. Conway and Moran have a good rapport but this investigation is putting a strain on their relationship. Moran is determined to take the case one direction, but Conway wants to go another, and it puts a definite crack in their perfect team. Conway has other issues to deal with as well, like a man watching her house, the other detectives making life difficult for her, and a reporter that won't get off her back. There's a lot of pressure on her to wrap this up quickly but with no real evidence or witnesses, it's a hard thing to do. Can Conway and Moran get back on the same page in time to find out who the murderer is?

All in all, a great addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series. If you've enjoyed French's other novels, or like a slow burn mystery then this would be a great read for you."
"I have now read all six of the Dublin Murder Squad books, in order. They were all good, although some were better than others. I would put this one in the top three.
For those unfamiliar with the series, they are written in the first person, and a supporting character from the preceding book then becomes the main character of the next book. In The Secret Place, the book before this one, Stephen Moran was our main character. In this outing, it's Antoinette Conway, his partner who had brought him into the murder squad.
It is implied that Antoinette is most likely of Asian ancestry, (described as ""brown"" more than once), and her father ran out on her mother when she was a baby, and she grew up in poverty. As a consequence, she has a chip on her shoulder, and is both quick to anger and take offense, which does not make her popular amongst her fellow detectives. As a reader, I did understand her motivations and liked her, even though she was not always sympathetic to the victim and others in her orbit.
Speaking of the victim, she is Aislinn Murray, a beautiful young woman found dead from head trauma in her apartment. At first blush, it looks like a straight-forward domestic violence case, but there is more than meets the eye here. I won't say anymore on that; you will just have to read it for yourself.
Judging from the publication history, it looks like that Tana French is stopping at six, which is too bad, because I did like the series. Having said that, she has written three other books after this, and I am sure that I will be checking them out at some point in the future.
One final quibble: I'm not in love with the title. ""Trespasser"" seems the wrong word here."
"Wow. The Trespasser was a great listen. I’m always looking for a book that I don’t want to stop reading or listening, and this is the best one I’ve found for a long time. And it is the best of all the Tana French books.

Like the previous books in her Dublin Murder Squad Series, each book involves one or two detectives in the department and the books do not build on each other, so they can be read in any order or independently. The Likeness had been the one I liked the most and The Secret Place the least. Now this is the one I like best.

Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, and the Squad room itself, are the main characters. They are given a case that they assume is a domestic homicide, but it is more complex. The reader follows in detail their day to day attempts to solve the case, and their changing ideas as to what might have happened, from Antoinette’s perspective. I complained that in The Secret Place, the investigation seemed endless, but in The Trespasser, I did not want to miss a minute of it.

The Irish dialect of the narrator was a little too strong for me, making it necessary for me to listen much more carefully.

I voted for The Trespasser in Goodreads’ Semifinal competition for their 2016 Choice Award in the Mystery and Thriller area. Previously I thought a book could not beat Stephen King’s End of Watch, but this one does by a hair.

Rating: 4+

"What a great new entry to the Dublin Murder Squad series! I truly enjoyed ""The Trespasser.""

As with the previous books in this series, French's narrator is a fresh voice, but this time the character is very familiar. Conway had a key role in the last Murder Squad book, and her partner, Moran, who narrated previously, is once again a key player in ""The Trespasser."" I enjoyed the familiarity of the characters, as well as hearing more of Conway's inner voice.

Indeed, I would say that inner voices were the theme of ""The Trespasser."" Through the characters and the story line, French challenges the reader to do some introspection. I was especially interested in the idea of discovering your inner biases and therefore recognizing the life story you're writing for yourself—and whether or not it's based in truth or fiction.

As always, I enjoyed French's narrative style, her descriptions of detective work (specifically the amazing interrogations), and plot twists (is the murder squad's one consistent character, O'Kelley, a good cop or a bad one?). I also appreciate that she doesn't feel the need to dwell on violence or gore in any way. The only reason I knocked a star off this one is that she uses my Lord's name in vain consistently throughout the book and I can't condone that—it certainly lessened my enjoyment.

If you've been reading the Dublin Murder Squad series, don't miss this one! And even if you haven't, The Trespasser makes a great stand-alone read."
"I listened to the audiobook. I had to concentrate a bit harder in order to understand what the narrator is saying due to the Irish accent (which I try to avoid doing because I enjoy my audiobooks while at work - therefore I'm already multitasking). I'm sure this is why I didn't give this book a 5-star rating. There were times when I had to re-listen to a chapter or two in order to recover what I had missed because the narration was becoming white-noise of sorts since it was more difficult to concentrate on listening while I was working. I'd have to say that this was a great thriller/mystery. The way that the author tied in the main character's personal struggles with the victim's was genius. I also really appreciated the reality approach of the author. So many novels I've read will find how one is proven innocent and BAM! The person is released from prison in a snap when in reality, it's usually years - sometimes decades - before a guilty verdict is overturned. Or, the opposite where someone is guilty - like law enforcement for example - but due to the protect-their-own reality, the person gets away with a crime. I'll just keep that a bit vague for spoiler purposes.

This is the third book I've read within the last month (I think) that had an Irish main character who had violent tendencies and bad tempers - all in a first person narrative. Sure, it's a stereotype but holy! It seems the reaction is ""hit first; ask questions later."" LOL"
"Review of The Trespasser, by Tana French. I was first drawn to Tana French’s mysteries by a review in the New Yorker (Oct 3, 2016). Her newest novel in the Dublin Murder Squad series, The Trespasser, did not disappoint. The plot hinges on the beating death of a young woman, Aislinn Murray, in her own home, dressed to the nines, with the table set and dinner for two in the oven. Narrated in the first person by the lead detective on the case, Antoinette Conway, the novel creates the claustrophobic sense of being trapped in her own paranoia toward her fellow detectives—as the only woman and the only minority on the murder squad. Antoinette is never sure who to trust, and who is out to get her. As she and her partner Steve follow one lead after another, we are never certain what is true and what is a red herring. The victim, who at first appears to be boring and Barbie-doll-like, is slowly revealed to be more complex—although never especially sympathetic. The gradual unveiling of suspects and the sense of menace from unknown enemies keep the reader engaged to the end. Like French’s previous novel Broken Harbor, this mystery follows a hard-boiled and disillusioned detective on the verge of abandoning the profession. Perhaps the brightest spot in this psychological portrait of the twists and turns of human interaction is the connection between Antoinette and Steve, two good partners in the making. I think we have not seen the last of this detective duo."
"I fell asleep right after reading this, and it gave me a horrible nightmare. Excellent.

But, really, another good one by French. Probably ranks slightly below Faithful Place and The Secret Place, but above the other three. Conway isn't that nice of a character nor is she super sympathetic to other characters in this, but her intolerance for other's BS is what makes her so tough and also probably what makes her such a great cop.

I also really liked the mystery in this one. In some of French's other books, the mystery is actually kind of second place, but she really focuses in on this one and I think it pays off. It won't make sense for a character like Conway to spend as much time reflecting on her own life as previous characters, like Cassie or Frank Mackey do. She want to get down to business, and she does, even as her personal life and how she doesn't completely fit in on the murder squad creeps in.

Slow beginning, but I find that in every French book. They happen usually in real time so the build-up to everything is slow. I think, though, I always feel so close to her characters because we see every minute of their day. Conway isn't a character to spill their guts, but because we see how some of the other detectives treat on her on a day-to-day basis, because we see that she calls her mother every night, we get to know her well and empathize with her anyway.

So, yeah, another good one by French. No huge surprise there.

"Tana French (2016) THE TRESSPASSER
London. Hodder & Stoughton

🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 4 out of 5 stars

Hodder writes, ""This is the case she imagined. Precision-cut and savage, lithe and momentous. Antoinette Conway, the tough, abrasive detective from The Secret Place, is still on the Murder squad, but only just. She's partnered up with Stephen Moran now, and that's going well - but the rest of her working life isn't. Antoinette doesn't play well with others, and there's a vicious running campaign in the squad to get rid of her. She and Stephen pull a case that at first looks like a slam-dunk lovers' tiff. All she and her partner have to do is track down Lover Boy and bring him in. Then it'll be back to business as usual, watching from a distance as the real detectives go up against the psychopaths. Except when Antoinette takes a good look at the victim's face, she realises she's seen her somewhere before. And suddenly the conviction that there's a different answer takes her breath away.""

This would have been a 5 if it weren't for the fact I spent the majority of the book really detesting the lead character, Antoinette Conway the copper. At her worst she's vile, at her best she's an irritant. That aside, this is a brilliant thriller - the characters were all potential culprits so I had no hope of guessing whodunnit. This is the second Tana French book I've read and IMO she's 2 for 2 on psychological crime thriller entertainment!

"Another enthralling crime novel by Tana French! There are so many layers to this story, I cannot even begin to describe the plot, but suffice it to say there are a number of ""mysteries"" presented to the reader here that grab and hold our attention: the death of the victim, one of the detective's possible involvement in the murder, potential gang ties, the surprising past identity of the victim, the protagonist's lost father, and so on.

Nevertheless, the story revolves to a large extent around the workings of a Murder Squad in Dublin that functions like a well-oiled machine, but with glitches. The protagonist, Antoinette Conway, a dark-skinned woman with a chip the size of a house on her shoulder, is beset and almost blinded by her intense paranoia concerning other members of the squad who seem to have it out for her. Talk about flawed! But she is tough and smart and good at what she does, so the reader is with her every step of the way. We get deep within her psyche, trying to solve not only the crime but the mystery of Antoinette's intense personality, as well. I loved this character. Also her young partner, Stephen Moran. They make quite a team.

I hate giving only four stars to this excellent book. The Trespasser is so beautifully written, but unfortunately French's use of the young-detective-tough-guy patois gets in the way of the story at times. It's hard to follow certain clues when they are embedded in cop lingo. This one flaw in the book makes for some pretty slow reading.

It's all worth it, though. This is a tautly constructed story filled with fascinating, well-drawn characters. Highly recommended."

""He's a dare, a bad poison dare that no one with sense should take, and I've always had a thing for dares.""

I'm so sad to be saying goodbye to this devilish, awful little murder squad. The last of the 6 Dublin Murder Squad installments - this one didn't quite do it for me in the same ways the other did, but closing the final chapter was bittersweet all the same.
Being in Antoinette's head was more unpleasant than most. The previous detectives were all full of shit in one way or another, but there was a spark there that held you close, riveted. Being in Antoniette's head felt more like sinking into a cold lake, with nothing to warm you up while you shiver and feel vague ickiness.
But the fact is, regardless of my thoughts on this last book, no one writes like Tana French. If other people could do it, I'm sure they would be out here making billions. But they can't. The only comparison I can think of is Gillian Flynn, who has mastered the self-destructive woman but who also dives much deeper into sex and carnal desire as sphere of murderous influence, whereas French's expertise lies in the violence inherent in economic stratification and the blurring of class lines.
I'll miss these horrible little Murder Ds, but I know they'll always be ready to be pulled down from the shelf if I get a little too pleased with my life and need to be reminded that we are shitty little fuckers, one and all.

"I'm so sad I'm caught up with this series now. For the past three years, I've started off the summer with a Dublin Murder Squad novel. I'm really hoping that we get more eventually, since this is such an open series with a different narrator for each book.
If The Secret Place was all about the trials of teenagers, this one delves deep into the squad's internal politics and the dangers of creating narratives. As expected, French develops a full-fledged, flawed narrator in Antoinette Conway. Her voice just shines off the page with French's usual bluntness and eclectic turn of phrase. I will say this one is quite a bit less lyrical than the previous entry, but then again it befits the story.
Something I hadn't managed to pin down, before this one, is how much dialogue has come to shape this series. At points, this novel struck for almost reading like a play. It is hella effective, too, from characterization to advancing the plot to building suspense and being funny when it wants to be. That said, the novel thrives because of Antoinette's internal voice.
I will complain that I guessed the answer to the mystery pretty early on. I kind of took some of the fun away from the first half. Despite that, when French got to the why of the mystery... then things got quite interesting again.

If you haven't checked out the first couple of books, then what are you waiting for?

My ultimate ranking of Dublin Murder Squad books: The Likeness > The Secret Place > The Trespasser > Faithful Place > In the Woods > .................................... > Broken Harbour

"After what I considered to be weaker efforts in volumes 4 and 5 of the Dublin Murder Squad books, Tana French returned to her previous level of excellence shown in the first three in this sixth and final volume of the Dublin Murder Squad (thus far anyway). In her books, the real story is not about solving the murder. The real story is about the psychological complexities and conflicts of one (and sometimes more than one) of the detectives assigned to investigate a murder. While the books do not HAVE to be read in order, I think they are more enjoyable if one does read them in order. In each subsequent volume, French brings a character who was a minor character in a previous volume and proceeds to peel away the layers of that detective’s inner conflicts, in doing so rendering wonderfully imagined characters. Her characterization, at its best, is simply superb. The detective who is front and center in this volume is Antoinette Conway, struggling as a female to fit in with the misogynistic crew of male detectives on the murder squad.

I found volumes 4 and 5 of the Dublin Murder Squad series to have plots that were just not plausible. French at her worst is still a very good writer. But “The Trespasser” returns to a totally plausible occurrence that could happen as a result of human weakness. I found the ending to be very satisfying!"
"What appears to be a straightforward murder in Stoneybatter with a cast-iron suspect slowly evolves into something altogether more complex. Detective Antoinette Conway is the central figure, her sharp narration building brilliant pen pictures of the characters and the nature of police work. Steve Moran returns as her more amiable partner with senior detective Breslin a sinister eminence gris. The plot development is meticulous and slow moving, with the use of straight interviews as the main engine. French's ability to get the nuance and wit of Dublinese spot on is vital to its success. Conway is the perfect balance of attraction/repulsion, larded with a reckless paranoia that puts the reader on edge. As she has before, there is a degree of coincidence in the formation of French's characters, so Conway relates curiously to the victim's past. The unique isolation of the lone child of a broken marriage is a prominent theme, along with the nature of trust and control in family and friendship, and of course professional life. Some suspension of disbelief was necessary as the mystery resolves, with shades of The She Devil and an affair that required a certain memory loss from one character. But this is a superb read, intelligent, witty and ultimately realised; look forward to returning to the Murder Squad."
"The police can do their work, to the best of their ability, suss out all of the facts, find the truth, get to the bottom of it, etc... but no matter how mind-F****** a story is, no matter how careful the slam dunk-

it only goes so far. Then it's up to the courts, and the court of public opinion. That's a story we don't get to read, but what an interesting angle for a spin-off series that would be... go back to each of the Murder Squad books, and tell the next bit from the defense/prosecution...

French provides the reader another great mental gymnastics routine. Just don't expect it to be neatly tied up in a bow. I enjoyed every word of it, don't get me wrong. It's just disappointing to realize that things don't always end right at the end. That another series of events has to take place before the bad guy goes away for good. I'm not saying he didn't get exactly what was coming to him, already. Just saying, after all the exhaustive efforts, after the good guys have got their man and have every bit of intentions, sometimes, it's out of their hands.

I'm happy with it. The right guy got ruined, at least, and that was the best thing the detectives could do for the victim. I'm glad things didn't go completely badly, the way it seemed they were going to.

She writes good work."
"This is the first Tana French I have read, this author coming recommended by a good friend.
It starts out slow, very slow, but then picks up towards the end. I look forward to reading more Tana French

There's the murder squad you set your sights on, back at the beginning of your career: the one where you spend your day playing knife-edge mind-games with psychopathic geniuses, knowing that one wrong blink could mean the difference between victory or another dead body.

And there's the one you actually work on, when you're the squad pariah. The night shifts. The vicious jobs and the pranks that go too far. Processing scumbags and matching witness statements, sifting the dregs for the case that might get you closer to where you want to be.

Tonight's case isn't it. Uniforms call it in as a slam-dunk domestic. All DI Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran have to do is track down Lover Boy and bring him in. Then it'll be back to business as usual, watching from a distance as the real Ds go up against psychopaths. Except when Conway takes a good look at the victim's face, she realises she's seen her somewhere before. And suddenly the conviction that there's a different answer takes her breath away.

This is the case she imagined. Precision-cut and savage, lithe and momentous.

But you can beat one killer. beating your own squad is a whole other thing......"
"Semi spoilers ahead!!I thought this book was fabulous. I am new to crime fiction and to Tana French, and I find that the slow starts need to be plowed through. Once you get to the bit where witnesses are being interviewed and more evidence shows up, you feel the wheels begin to turn like a train picking up speed. From there, it only goes faster, speeding till you get to the end, your eyes hungry for more!! French has an amazing sense of timing, and immersed the reader in her story. When Conway and Moran are confused and jumbled, so are you. I felt as though I was with them, wading through the mud, slashing through thicket in order to find the answer. I absolutely loved The Trespasser. I found it thrilling, and murky. The best way I could describe how I felt through 3/4 of the book was as I said before, as if I were surrounded by mud and gunk waiting for a clear path to show itself. I wasn’t completely surprised, but I did have moments of “oh f*** yes!!!” when more evidence was coming out. Definitely will be reading more DMS! Ps. I didn’t ~totally~ love Conway, but French made her so real. Being in her head was quite a ride. And intense! I would even say it was a treat! She makes me view our world (and people at work I find frustrating) differently! Oh, I also loved Moran! "
"In bestselling author Tana French’s newest “tour de force” (The New York Times), being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"
"Tana French is renowned for her detective series Dublin Murder Squad, which has been brought to streaming video as Dublin Murders. Fat murder mysteries (450 pages!) are not my thing, but I enjoyed her standalone novel The Searcher, and I saw this #6 novel was very highly rated, so I decided to give it a try.

French is a very fine writer—of character development, the police detective world, suspect-interviewing technique, and unfolding a narrative at a pace that keeps the story moving. The series focuses on different characters in the detective squad in each novel. In this one, her main character, Antoinette, is so prickly no one wants to work with her. She’s partnered with Steve, a man so cheerful his presence grates on her.
The story starts with a murder case that seems to be due to a domestic dispute that got out of hand. Suspicious elements pile up, and other detectives in the squad interfere in her case. Antoinette’s thinking changes over the course of the investigation (which only took about a week), and French’s close analysis of her thoughts make this almost a psychological suspense thriller. The long, emotionally dense story reminded me of a couple P.D. James mystery novels I read decades ago.

I read with interest all the way through to its conclusion, but now I'll leave the mystery genre for a while.

Four stars"
"""time after time it's left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.""

this was a three star book until those last 50ish pages. some of the most searing, nail-biting writing i've read in a long time and for almost all of it to be rooted in dialogue between 2-4 people is absolute insanity. tana french writes a damn good book.

the three stars exist because, and i stand by this, the mystery in this story is a little all over the place. now, this ends up being intentional and you, like our fearless lead detective, are being thrown hither and thither by the multitude of perspectives and theories. it truly keeps you guessing to the very end which may float some people's boats but i felt like i was being dragged along at some points. however, i really appreciate the return to a narrative that feeds into our protagonists' psyche, in a way we didn't get from ""the secret place."" antoinette is deeply human and a perfect fit for this story about paranoia, loyalty and the sins of the past.

i'm gutted to finish the dublin murder squad series but so, so thankful they exist for me to revisit whenever i feel like being wrung through the ringer!"
"I eagerly awaited this book for over two years, as no one can write a police procedural with heart like Tana French. I've read them out of order, but now I'm caught up chronologically, and they've just seemed to get better.

The Trespasser was, at first, a disappointment. Each of Tana French's novels features a different protagonist, a different detective on the Dublin Murder Squad, and Antoinette Conway was one of my least favorites. She has a chip on her shoulder as big as one of Joan Collins' shoulder pads, and it made for angsty reading. This book took me far longer to finish than her previous novels.

The plot wasn't much better-- the mystery itself had two possible solutions, an obvious answer that doesn't leave much mystery, and an amorphous ""but what if"" scenario that kept sending the detectives chasing down dead ends.

So why the 4 stars? For me, if a book has a great ending, it makes the journey worth it. This book had one of the best endings I've ever read-- not the actual solution to the mystery, which I found to be kind of mechanical. It was what came after that floored me. Without giving away spoilers, I'll just say that Detective Conway and her partner find the murderer but have no way to prove it. It's the resolution of this final conflict that blew me away.

I hope the next book features ""Gaffer"" (I'm guessing that's Irish slang for chief?) O'Kelly."
"This is the sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, which I've followed since the first appeared. Murder mysteries are not a genre I normally choose, but Tana French's intricate, psychological plots and beautiful writing, along with her passionate, quirky characters, are always absorbing. In The Trespasser, detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran unravel the life and death of a strikingly beautiful young woman, with many twists and turns along the way. One of French's many strengths is matching detective partners to ensure a lively banter and complex relationship. The lead detective, Antoinette Conway, sits and watches people passing by and shares her bleak perspective on humanity in one of Tana French's sentences that takes my breath away. ""Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too."" I love the grittiness of Dublin in winter, the stark interview rooms, and the dark side of Ireland today. "
"Tana French books have become an auto buy for me; there is just something about her writing and characters that always draw me in. Her books are not happy little mysteries that wrap up beautifully with everyone finding a happily ever after. The characters overall are mostly broken people or if you'd rather real people with real problems. This book didn't disappoint me in any way.

Antoinette has some major daddy issues similar to their vic's and Stephen Moran is just a sweet cup of tea! Together they make up the youngest of the murder d's. Recently Antoinette has been getting her fair share of hazing for being the only girl on the squad and a relative newbie. So when they get thrown a murder case that may actually be something good the pair are a little be skeptical. Aislinn Murray's case at first look seems like a by the book domestic gone wrong but somewhere along the investigation Stephen and Antoinette believe that might not be true. With pressure to solve the case coming from all sides will they throw the book at the boyfriend or risk upsetting the delicate balance they work in. Left with nothing else to do they steam straight on doing the best they can to get Aislinn some form of justice!"
"I'd give this one 4.5 stars if I could. While I've previously said I rarely read mysteries, I always make an exception for Tana French. She is without question (my opinion!) one of the very best, and most literary, of crime fiction writers. Every book is a small masterpiece of plot, character development, and page-turning intensity. This is her 6th book and, I believe, one of her best (I've read them all). All the novels focus on detectives working in the Murder Squad in Dublin; each main character usually has shown up in a minor role in an earlier book or will appear (minor, again) in a subsequent book. All are in the first person, and French's main character is frequently male (I think only two, including this one, use a female protagonist). She does an astounding job of getting into the male psyche while doing an equally-terrific job with her female detectives. The Trespasser is more focused on solving the crime via office machinations and interrogations, a bit different than most of her books. But, again, a totally-fascinating read.

French's writing is so good that I'd highly recommend her to anyone, regardless of his/her tastes, to try out at least once. I do not think you'll be disappointed."
"Another winner by this Irish writer, this one centered on Antoinette Conway, a couple of years into her stint with the Murder Squad. She is partnered with Steve and is seemingly on the outs with all of the other detectives, who shun her and have in other ways disrespected and even sabotaged her -- stealing reports from her desk, peeing in her locker, and so on. When Antoinette and Steve are given a case of a dead girl, and one of the ""older, more experienced"" detectives is assigned to ""ride along"" on the case, it seems like another instance of setting her up to fail, to force her out of the squad for good. But she doggedly follows every lead, determined to be a good detective, while at the same time planning to leave the squad and going with a job offer at a security firm - as soon as this case is solved. Most of this book involves Antoinette's internal dialogue, along with a good bit of actual dialogue between characters. Not a lot of action. So it reads like a TV police show. (anybody else like ""Suits?"" That's all dialogue! I couldn't help but try to cast each of the roles. And if this is ever made into a TV show or movie, I will enjoy watching it, as the story weaves into and out of possible solutions and scenarios, and veers off with surprises often enough to be exciting. "
"A young women is found murdered in her flat and the police is quick to turn to her boyfriend as a suspect. But this solution is too simple for Detective Antionette Conway and Detective Steve Moran - nothing seems to really fit and everytime they think they come close to solcing the case something happens to throw them back a few steps. Antionette‘s difficult standing within the squad doesn’t help either because her colleagues do everything to make her life hell.


This was a very slow read for me. Usually I don‘t like to read the same book for several weeks because often I get bored with the story and want to move on to another book on my TBR - there are a lots of books I want to read, so I don’t want to stick with one book for too long. In this case it actually didn’t bother me. This was a great read! It was slow paced and character driven and while I couldn’t connect to Antionette on any level, I still liked her as the protagonist of this story. She‘s not a person that is easy to like and her partner Steve Moran seemed like a pushover most of the time. Nevertheless they gave an interesting perspective to the story. All in all I enjoyed this book and I‘m really looking forward to read the rest of the Dublin Murder Squad series!"

"I must read a detective novel about once a year at most. I only picked this one up after a recommendation from the Slate Culture podcast, and then I was deeply sceptical that the rave reviews weren't being given to this book only through that American fondness for all things Irish.
But this is excellent.
It helps that it's set in a recognisably contemporary Dublin, with recognisably modern characters. The lead character, Conway, being non white and from a single parent family, for example.
Then, rather than drive a story through plot twists and turns, French, instead, develops her story through having the victim’s history run parallel with Conway’s; through having Conway’s approach to her case being driven by her misconceptions about the detective squad she works in; and through the denouement at the end being as much about Conway coming to terms with her own misconceptions.
Unfortunately I’ve started on book 6 - what with Edinburgh Waterstones having no other Tana French novels, but this has sent me off to start reading the series from the beginning.

Four stars not five because I’m mean with marks, and because I never got that true fear which the best crime fiction can give me.
"
"My first Tana French, it won't be the last! (A Highland library book...)This was an interesting read. In places, very simple, in others, a bit less so... But never becoming too intellectual.It was an interesting conundrum remembering my conversation with Graeme Sheppard, in Beijing about Pamela Werner. (The thrust being that the obvious was most likely.)I felt this had been influenced by 'Line Of Duty', as all the key information was conveyed by interview. For the whodunnit persuasion there is a limited pool of suspects, which stops wild information pervading. I did feel for the first two thirds that the solution was as Breslin laid out, and his machinations were a distracting device.I found the central narrative voice annoying and borderline paranoid, she has a boulder on her shoulder, but this is a plot device, and always seemed so.I feel that reading this quickly helped, as in Agatha Christie, so that the intrinsic issues do not gain an uppermost view. There was no feel of Dublin, it could have been anywhere, that may simply be the case; I hope so!I felt that the issues of loyalty would be more fully looked at, which is the strength of 'L.A. Confidential.I am intrigued and looking forward to 'In The Woods'."
"Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are assigned to a murder investigation that seems to be a domestic. Upon arriving and being their investigation, they discover more than what was supposed to be a cut and dried case. Having to work with another detective, Breslin, they start interviewing the victim's mates and date for that evening. Though the circumstantial evidence keeps piling up, both realize that the person they are looking at does not fit for them. They begin digging deeper because of the victim's best friend's story and a password protected file on her computer. Will they get the right person? Or is all the evidence too circumstantial to make it fit any suspect?

I enjoyed this story. I liked Antoinette and Steve. I liked their thoroughness. I wish they had not been saddled with Breslin during the investigation. He was a jerk. Even when their what if's were wrong, it was fun watching them go after those leads. When it was explained at the end, I felt like them.

The story was a simple tale. It was the twists that made it interesting. I was glad the truth came out. I was also happy with the decision Antoinette made at the end. If there are more books in this series, I hope to see these two again."
"You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that.

Is this the last book for the Dublin Murder Squad?? I really hope not. But either way, once again Tana French does not disappoint. I really enjoy her novels so much. I'd say that this one had more of the ""can't put it down"" feel to it, as far as the mystery goes-I just couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Of course, it also had a lot of what I love from French as far as character and relationship development goes. Antoinette Conway is a beast, and I love her. Sometimes she got a bit inside her head, feeling that others were out to get her, which was a bit irritating, but what woman among us doesn't feel those feelings? And her interactions with Stephen Moran were bang on-They are no Cassie and Rob, but I still loved seeing them work together and enjoyed their banter.

Now that I've come to the end of the Dublin Murder Squad series (at least for now?), it's time to get busy on the stand-alones. Tana French is a must read author for me, and I feel like whatever I pick up from her I'm going to love.

Another 4.5 stars for this one."

"Detective Antoinette Conway has worked hard to join the Murder Squad, but it's not working out the way she planned. Although she gets along with her partner Stephen Moran, the rest of the squad seems out to get her. She can't even leave her coffee unattended without someone spitting in it.

Their new case is the murder of pretty Aislinn Murray, found dead in her living room. With little evidence to go on, the other detectives pressure Antoinette and Steve to arrest Aislinn's boyfriend. But the partners feel there's more to the case, and Antoinette is sure she's seen Aislinn before. Their investigation leads them away from the boyfriend and into danger from their own colleagues.

Antoinette is a strong, feisty character with plenty of built-up rage. Steve is a little too imaginative for his own good, but he makes a great foil for Antoinette. The plot, though complicated, is not too tangled, and the outcome makes sense based on the characters' backstories and behavior. With the story set in Dublin, the dialogue is heavy with Irish vernacular and sometimes difficult to follow. Mystery lovers who can decipher the characters' speech will enjoy this well-written story."
"Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are called in to solve the case of a young woman named Aislinn Murray who is found dead in her apartment. At first glance the case looks to be solved rather quickly for Aislinn was to have dinner with a new boyfriend who becomes the primary suspect. But as more evidence is unearthed the case grows to be more and more complicated and the two detectives don’t believe that the easiest solution is the correct one.

French incorporates into the book how the members of the Murder Squad interact with one another as they solve this case especially because Antoinette is currently the only female member. Additionally, her partner, Stephen, is one of the newer members of the squad. Due to this, Conway has had to endure some friction and harassment from some of the older squad members. So she is even more determined to make sure that the case is solved without any mistakes or reservations.

The book is a well written crime novel with a plausible and satisfying conclusion. The audio version was agreeably done with the narrator speaking the voices in true Irish brogue."
"I'm a huge French fan. The first 4 books about the Dublin Murder Squad were brilliant. I was a little underwhelmed by #5. I'm having a hard time reviewing this entry. We are now introduced to a new pair of detectives from the squad, Antoinette and Steve. They are assigned a case in which a young attractive woman is found murdered in her tidy apartment. I found the first half of the book very frustrating for various reasons. Antoinette had a chip on her shoulder probably twice her weight and this got old really fast. As well, she and Steve, being relatively new to Murder, were so bent on this case being more than just a 'boring domestic' that they spent way too much time chasing crazy ideas, all while trying to hide their suspicions from a more seasoned detective assigned to watch over them. The story got a lot better once they got out of their own way and started to inch toward the truth. The last few scenes with their boss and the suspect were extremely well written and very gripping. The question is, was the first 50% of the meandering plot necessary to set the stage for the denouement? I'm still not sure. "
"Finally finished the series. Tana French gets a high B+ from me. I'm eager for the next book in the series (will it be Roch or Quigley...or perhaps a return to Ryan?) and am looking forward to the TV series. I hope the cast matches my imagination.





Minor Spoilers....





The theme of this book is fantasy. The murder victim, a young woman named Aislin concocted an unbelievable 'fantasy' revenge scenario that backfired, although, in the end, her ultimate goal was achieved.

It also speaks to the negative fantasies of the protagonists, Antoinette Conway. She was the 'other' lead in the Secret Place. We know what her partner Steve Moran thinks of her and how she operates, now we get to see what's actually going on inside her head. She is a good detective but unfortunately suffers from paranoia which affects her reasoning and her deductions.

This was a good story, with several twists and turns and false leads worthy of a British detective episode. My only complaint was the interrogation scenes took way too long. I found myself thinking ""Get on with it already!"" but maybe that's me being an impatient reader who needs action to break the quiet moments.



"
"A cryptic call is made to the neighbouring Police Station, “ A woman is injured at the Number 26,Viking Gardens.” When Conway and Moran arrive at the scene, the woman is already dead. A romantic dinner is set for two. Date at 8. It seems a pretty straight forward case of a date gone wrong. . But neither of them are prepared when the most obvious solutions turns turtle and new possibilities come up with some of them threatening enough which leaves no one above suspicion.

The book is edgy, twisty with a really good suspense. Moreover, it doesn’t end with the identification of the culprit but what comes after it. I loved how French showcased the straining of the relationships between cops, when the pressure becomes gigantic. It is not all cut and dry in this novel. So many different aspects of the investigation process are covered that you just can’t help but fall into the book. At the same time, it could have been at least 50 – 75 pages shorter, since there are certain angles, which are too detailed, bordering on, tedious.

All in all, this book is not to be skipped if you are a lover of crime thrillers.

"This is the first book by Tana French that I've read and it was a lend, with recommendation, from a friend so I have high expectation. The detective is the sole female in the murder squad in Contemporary Dublin and she's under oodles of pressure. The squad don't like her, and the reader suspects that's because of her prickly style, her partner is good but inexperienced, and her boss has confined them to the night shift (all the good murders come in during daytime apparently?) and domestic assault cases.

So when she lands a real case with possible gangland or corrupt police connections is makes her day, but that's before the case twists and turns a dozen times in her hands and she is lumbered with another, experienced, detective to ""help"" them out.

I enjoyed the read and will read more by this author, I loved mysteries and having them set in my home town is a rare joy, but at times the plot became so convoluted that it lost me. The author tries to make nearly every key player an unreliable narrator or liar and that was a little too much at times for me. Overall however, it was well paced, interesting, detailed, and believable. Good ending."
"I was surprised (in a good way) by how much I enjoyed this. I had read 'The Wych Elm' previously and thought it was pretty poor. But many of the reviews of that book said 'I really like her Dublin Murder Squad series' (although The Wych Elam is a let down) so I thought I'd give her another chance when I saw this in my local charity bookshop... serendipity and all that.

So, it's a very engrossing book, lots of twists and turns, a gripping murder inquiry. At times her plot shifts are a bit hard to swallow, but she keeps the pace relentless, and her descriptions of how a detective feels as a case takes shape, and a suspect emerges, seem quite credible to a non-detective (ie ME). At times this tips into imagery that is probably a bit over the top, but in fairness one has to suspend some of one's disbelief and give her some credit for the pacing in the book.

Would I buy another Tana French book? Maybe. Would I borrow her first one (Into the Woods, I think) from my local library OR pick it up in a charity bookshop? Absolutely. Redemption of a sort, I guess, for subjecting me to The Wych Elm.

"
"I’ve now officially read all of Tana French’s novels. Her way of delving into a mystery may seem slow at times, but you also get a glimpse into the interesting minds of the members of the Dublin Murder Squad, each narrating their own story. As an American, learning about Irish culture has been really intriguing as well.

This novel is told from the perspective of Antoinette Conway, the only woman on her squad. Antoinette is tough, with something to prove in the “old boys club” atmosphere which permeates the murder squad. As the low men on the totem pole, Conway and her newbie partner Stephen Moran, mostly get stuck with cut-and-dry domestic-violence-related homicides, and when their supervisor assigns them to investigate the death of a twenty-something named Aislinn Murray, the detectives figure that this case will be no different. Yet some things just don’t add up.

I liked this one, although Conway’s “everyone’s out to get me” attitude was a bit annoying, and poor Stephen Moran seems like a good detective if anyone will ever allow him the opportunity to prove himself. Four stars and I hope French writes more, whether for this series or a standalone."
"“You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that’s built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that.” - Tana French, The Trespasser

Near the end of their graveyard shift, Detectives Conway and Moran are handed a case with more than meets the eye. A woman was reported as deceased, but direct to the police and not to 999 (the UK equivalent to 911 for us Yanks). Detective Conway has a history with the victim, though it was before she was on Murder, back when she was with Missing Persons.

Along the way, one of the more tenured Murder detectives keeps sticking their nose in on Conway and Moran's investigation under the guise of helpfulness. All along, we discover that Conway has been fostering a bit of paranoia against the Murder Squad.

Tana French keeps the quality of the Murder Squad series on the up-and-up. I fell for the false flag she put in along with a few other pieces of deception before the penny dropped. I had a great time getting back into the series, and Conway's POV was fantastic."
"Задачата на детектив Антоанет Конуей, сервирана ѝ пет минути преди края на тежко нощно дежурство, е да открие убиеца на госпожица Ашли Мъри, намерена с разбит череп в собствената си кухня в хипстърския квартал Стоунибатър, и да докаже хипотезата си. Но за целта трябва първо да съумее да преплува опасните или създаващи усещане за опасност подводни течния и мъртви вълнения в отдел Убийства на дъблинската полиция, в който е приета наскоро, и където по ред субективни и обективни причини не чувства водите за свои. Което от своя страна изисква точно преценка за обективното и субективното. Което пък изисква да се вникне в мисленето на жертвата, преди коренно да промени живота си, доскоро ограничен в рамките на семейство с изчезнал баща и покрусена майка, а също и външния си вид от незабележима девойка на гримирана кукла Барби. Добър психологически трилър. Българската връзка е част от мрачния и хладен пейзаж край Дъблинския замък, по съвпадение споделящ парк с полицейския участък, където млади предприемачи обсъждат имотния пазар по Черноморието на по картонена чаша горещо кафе в обедната почивка. "
"Another fantastic seasonal read. Nothing says spooky season like a murder and goodness knows the Dublin Murder Squad series if full of those (the clue is in the name). Our heroine in this book is Antoinette Conway, the lone female and non-white member of the murder squad and consequently the object of frequent workplace harassment and bullying. Her only ally is her partner, Stephen, who sticks by her even as they get landed with rubbish case after rubbish case by the old boys' network. Understandably though the whole situation is making Antoinette pretty prickly and paranoid, so when a simple domestic homicide case starts to seem a lot more complicated than it first appeared, Antoinette is questioning her sanity. But is it paranoia if they really are all out to get you? And is Antoinette willing to risk her career to bring down a murderer who might be hiding a little close to home? Maybe even in her own squad room? This was a brilliant end to the series and I think Antoinette was my favourite protagonist yet. I'm sad to see her and the rest of the squad go, but thankfully French has plenty more books to keep me going. "
"好像又隔了好些年，作者終於又寫了第六本說小說。之前的慣例是後一本的主角「我」，都是前一本出現在主角身邊的人物，由此衍生出來跟上一本故事有點關係又不太需要有關係的新案件。但這回不是。也許作者發現要維持那樣的慣例，在描述現在這個故事時，難免顧此失彼，綁手綁腳；又或者是作者終於發現，寫成主角重複出現那樣的系列警探故事，其實也沒有什麼不好。總之，這次的主角還是上回那本「我知道誰殺了他」的重案組搭檔──性格惡劣的唯一女警探安東妮特‧康威，和長相俊美個性溫柔的史帝芬‧莫蘭。

在安靜住宅區裡，一名年輕的獨居女子盛裝躺在自家客廳的壁爐前，頭上的鮮血漫了滿地，飯桌上精美的餐具、桌布、餐巾和燒盡的蠟燭擺設，再再暗示一場還沒來得及開始的愛的晚餐因故中斷了。在重案組裡不受重視的兩位年輕警探安東妮特‧康威和史帝芬‧莫蘭奉命辦案，組長指派「協助」的資深警官老要將兇嫌的牌子往女子新認識的男友身上掛。怎麼樣都不肯屈從的康威和莫蘭，一方面要亂槍打鳥找線索，另一方面還要提防組裡其他人的落井下石，腹背受敵，老是疑神疑鬼。

就在處處碰壁時，對人臉過目不忘的康威記起多年前在失蹤人口組工作時，曾遇過小時候的這名女子。等挖出陳年資料，從看似毫無相關的舊案中才發現，當年警察以「查無此人」回報女子的母親報案找尋突然離家無下落的丈夫，事實上身為人夫、人父的男子，拋棄了婚姻、女兒、家庭，只為斬斷過去，好和愛侶遠走高飛，重獲新生。刻意隱瞞實情的辦案刑警自我主張地認為，艷不可方的年輕媽媽「應該」帶著小女兒從完全斬斷過去，追尋新人生。然而這對母女之後的人生並沒有「重新開始」，困在未解謎團中的母親漸漸精神失常，長年照顧母親的小女孩在母親過世後重獲自由，卻更加執著於尋找父親下落，甚至決定不擇手段接近當年的辦案刑警。直到知道當年不是沒有找到爸爸，而是辦案刑警擅自決定了「為了她好」的結論，年輕女子改變初衷，從「找出真相」的目的轉而成為復仇大計，要眼前這位早已認不出她是誰的中年刑警落入自己設定的美人計，搞得他妻離子散後再一走了之，讓他也嚐嚐被他人莫名其妙侵入自己人生的滋味。

除了精彩的緝凶外，時時縈繞的另個主題是壞脾氣的康威在���案組中被孤立甚至被霸凌的職場生活。她不但不能信任任何同事，甚至疑心搭檔史帝芬。絕佳默契的兩人除了鬥嘴外，每一次一搭一唱完美的審問場面，更是書中精采的片段。作者讓這書跟其他辦案小說不同之處，就在於殺人動機往往不是嗜血變態，而是厭倦過著幾近無生趣日子的平凡人，突然發現只要把某個弄擰的角度拉直了就可以脫離平庸，迎向光明，卻沒想到向來從弄擰的角度所看出去的風景，都是扭曲、騙人的海市蜃樓。藉由這樣的手法(殺人)做的改變，通通只是徒勞無功。

到目前為止，看了作者六本書，以「好看度」而言，這本可以名列前二名。

靜待下一本。

"I have read all Tana French's previous novels (favourite is Broken Harbour) so I was really looking forward to this. I have given it 4 stars, but I was torn between 5 stars and 3 stars as I couldn't make up my mind about it at all.
It is full of paranoia on behalf of the main character (didn't get how she was called Antoinette, it really didn't suit her at all) and it was a while before I wondered about her reliability in terms of what was going on. Particularly as she and her partner went charging off on long reams of fantasy what ifs that didn't sit comfortably with me. But then .... the whole book was about stories, each character had their reality, but spun tales of what might have been, what the truth might have looked like (or not) and what they wanted it to be, or thought it was.
What I did like was: the relationship between Conway and Moran, the ebb and flow, also how it followed on from The Secret Place: the long interview scenes with Conway and Breslin, they were clever and funny: the end although it was unexpected."
"How does she do it? Tana French continues to amaze and delight me with her Dublin Murder Squad series, where each new entry delves into the soul of each character.
In this latest novel, French continues the story of detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, who partnered up in the previous book, The Secret Place. They've been handed the murder of a young woman, Aislinn Murray, and the initial evidence seems to point to the new boyfriend, but as in French's other work, things are not what they seem on the surface. Not only is the trail leading them to a disturbing and possible career-jeopardizing conclusion, the two are still working out their sometimes uneasy relationship as partners.
As it is with real people, the protagonists are not always likeable, or sure of themselves, or of each other. French is brilliant at leading the reader to a certain place and then sending it all sideways, which is such a pleasure. I'm hoping there will be at least several more in the series!
"
"This is an unusual police procedural; nobody is who they appear to be, and Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran have to play an endless guessing game trying to figure out who among their colleagues is trying to scuttle their murder investigation, and why. That emphasis on deceit and the advancement of occult agendas makes for a murder mystery that seems akin to an intelligence thriller. It also means that the typical tight plotting of a murder mystery is disrupted by the apparent need to chase down what look like irrelevant ends. But all's well; the ends tie up, and in a satisfying way.

That aside out of the way, The Trespasser shows French's great strength at characterization. Her characters, starting with Conway and Moran are real. They have good days and bad, get distracted, have monents of insight, and can be derailed by office politics and petty jealousies, just like real people. French's ability to express how people react to those stresses gives her fiction a piercing sense of reality, which makes her a pleasure to read."
"Another brilliantly penned, gut-wrenching story from a master in literary crime.

As with all Tana French novels, it took me a hefty hundred pages to get fully engaged with the characters and the story. And, as with all her novels, long after the final pages, long after the finishing the novel, the characters continued to whisper to me.

Haunting and complex, this novel is a worthy read for those willing to delve into the dark corners of crimes of passion, wounded souls, and human tragedies. Those who love masterful writing will also find much to admire.

Personally, I find it very interesting to see how the style of Tana French's writing has evolved over time. So gifted in description, proprioception, space, emotion, metaphor, sub-text, and the complex layering of inner conflict and motivation, it's always a joy to read her books. Although not my favourite in the Dublin series (I preferred ""In the Woods, ""The Likeness"", and ""The Secret Place""), ""The Trespasser"" did not disappoint."
"I really liked this mystery. I was totally sucked in, and found myself sneaking in pages at lunchtime and fitting in some reading time before work.
I did feel a little handicapped in my reading, because there was so much Irish slang. However, now when people are talking about their gaff and their shite and their jacks and their gaffer and their gobs, I may be more knowledgeable. It took a slow reading to collect new vocabulary. But that’s okay.

I don’t really like stories about girls with Daddy issues, and this one had to get over a dad who deserted the family when the girl was a youngster, and a dad who was never on the scene and about whom the mum fabricated tall tale after tall tale. But it managed!

I loved the underdog element, where the only female detective on the murder squad is being harassed by her peers, and she won’t give in.
I liked how I never believed for a minute that the main suspect did it.
I loved her reliance and reluctance about her partner.
I liked how it was dark and dreary for the whole story.

Good book."
"I loved the relationship between Detectives Conway and Moran in The Secret Place and had really been looking forward to reading more of them here--and I was not disappointed. It was great to be in Conway's head and to get a window into her thought processes and her experiences. What a nightmare her life in the Murder Squad was. It made sense to me that this book was darker in feel than the previous one, because she is less positive, less trusting, more under fire, paranoid because people really are out to get her. But I love how she and Moran work together, even when there's a rift between them. French always manages to surprise me with who the murderer is and why; I've never once caught her out. And I'm crazy about her writing. Here's one of my favorite lines, which was so perfect an ending for the interaction she'd just had with Breslin: ""I'm on the top floor and turning down the corridor before I hear Breslin's footsteps start again, echoing around the stairwell in slow cold claps."" Those footsteps like slow claps give me happy-writing goosebumps!"
"Finally understand why the world keeps raving about this one!! Pitch perfect!! Fantastic interrogation scenes. Slow burn mystery. Excellent character development. Two detectives: sweet, kind Stephen Moran and badass, tough-hearted Antoinette Conway. What really got to me in her character: she had a difficult childhood but her nonchalance about it, her acceptance in how life is shit and going from there. She’s a woman in a man’s world and fights it everyday . Ignoring all the good people in her life, constantly suspicious of everyone’s intentions, pushing people away. It’s such a refreshing woman character and just read The secret place and The trespasser for her character. Moran is the ambitious cop who fights tooth and nail against the universe to get where he wants to be. No ego, clever as a southern. He’ll be an idiot if that’s what you want to see and he walks away with voluntary confessions. Best detective team up ever!!! The twist midway through the book makes your hairs stand up on end!! The climax left me stoned and stunned. Pick this one up. Now ! "
"Though this is #6 of French's Dublin Murder novels, it is a stand alone. The plot emerges around the death of Aislinn Murray who has done a lot of self-improvement with a strong motive. The two detectives in charge of the case are the two youngest officers assigned to the Murder Squad. At first blush this is a simple case to solve but very early the main investor Detective Antoinette Conway has her suspicions that there is a cover up within the Murder Squad. Being the only female detective, Conway is constantly being harassed. Her partner Detective Stephen Moran has a vivid imagination which causes them to 'chase different rabbits'. The pressure is on to close the case because it seems that the murder is an open and close case. The boyfriend has killed Aislinn on purpose or accidentally. But Detective Conway will not let her peers direct this investigation because it has been assigned to her. The plot has a lot of twist and turns and the real murderer is not identified until the end of the novel."
"Asilinn Murray is found dead in her own apartment. But every surface is wiped clean. A search of her apartment does not explain much about her as a person, either. It seems that she furnished her apartment and dressed and coiffed herself as if following the advice of magazines. Nothing looks natural or normal. Everything is just too perfect.

Detective Antoinette Conway is trusted with this strange case, and she, and her partner, Steve, enthusiastically hit the streets, looking for clues. However, Antoinette has never had it easy at the squad. The men all play practical jokes on her and give her a hard time, and, to top it off, there is a man standing at the top of her street, casing out her apartment. And their only suspect so far seems like an unlikely one. Antoinette and Steve have their job cut out for them. But when they finally discover the truth, they almost wish they hadn’t.

I love Tana French’s mysteries! This one, like her others, are impossible to figure out. Her characters are strong and realistic and oh so human! Her settings are unforgettable.
"
"Another really solid Tana French book. As usual the writing was great, the characters were well-realized, and the story went to satisfyingly dark places. A couple of complaints below (with spoilers).

[Spoilers Below]



1. It was a bit hard to believe that Aislinn placed so much blame on the man who lied to her about her father's whereabouts while seemingly placing much less blame on her father himself (who chose to leave). Given that this was the central driving force for her actions, it didn't feel believable enough.

2. During the first half of the book, Antionette is going along with and then ultimately rejecting all of her partner's wild theories about the case and telling him to stop coming up with more. So I didn't understand why just a short time later, she came up with *another* wild theory (about the other detectives' involvement with the murder), and then seemed totally fine indulging it. The fact that the theory then turns out to be (nearly) correct was also a bit hard to believe.
"
"I don’t know? People seem to LOVE this book. I didn’t. I’m giving it four stars, because I can appreciate a well-crafted novel, and I felt immersed in the characters and stories. I just felt the “mystery” part was not there at all. The book was just so slow. It actually made me appreciate how dull being a detective must be. Like ten minutes of adrenaline per week of drudgery. I also realized how much I would hate being a detective (which I certainly knew from years of watching Law & Order). I think this book also didn’t connect because I don’t love sarcasm or sarcastic characters. I find it gets old quick. I understand it’s an important part of the characterization and get why Conway is so sarcastic, but I don’t enjoy it. Nevertheless, the book felt very well-written. I enjoyed the language, the Irish-isms, the characters. The audiobook narrator was very good (though I HATED some of the voices...but I think that’s supposed to be on purpose).

"A Tana French novel is what you reach for when you want nitty gritty and all areas of gray, and you’re not in a hurry to get to the whodunit until much, much later. She always feature anti-heroes, not the idealized versions of law and order crime fighters. Rather they’re tough-edged, semi-insular individuals who usually wind up having some sort of existential or moral crisis at some point during the investigation.

The Trespasser was slightly more suspenseful to me because it involved a single woman found dead in her own home. As with all her DMS books, French does not rush through scenes and works hard to delve into the psyche of all the characters. There was heavy emphasis on the internal politics of the Murder Squad with Detective Conway being the only female detective who still hasn’t been accepted into the fold. She and Detective Moran make a good team. Once again, they’re not the jolly kind of partners but that’s not French’s style.

This is one of those books that you think about when you’re away from it. Another a great read of one of my fave writers."
"Honestly, this only gets four stars because Tana French herself set my five-star standard with ""In the Woods,"" ""The Likeness,"" and ""Faithful Place."" I finished this book in about 48 hours and loved it, in that strange, unhappy, edge-of-my-seat kind of way that also made it a little bit painful. It hurt to watch Conway, our protagonist, being pushed closer and closer to her breaking point; it hurt to watch her thoughts about Moran change; it hurt to watch the case close around a deep and fundamental breach of trust.

I found that this book moved more slowly than her others. Part of the reason I read it so fast is that I refused to put it down until they'd made headway on the case, but unfortunately, that didn't happen for the first three-quarters of the book. That's not to say nothing happened--the psychological drama and character development were excellent--but I began to feel rather strung-along. That said, the ending hit with a bang, as French's endings always do. Yes, I will continue to read every French mystery that comes out."
"4.5 Stars

I will always read a Tana French book: for her capacity to build a setting and to draw nuanced, three-dimensional characters that practically walk off the page and into my imagination. But I’ve also always said that she just can’t stick the landing. Almost all of her books have disappointed me in their climax and denoument.

Imagine my surprise while reading this book that for a long while felt like a slog—overly long and too much detail about the police procedural aspect. And then…150 pages from the end, it grabbed me and didn’t let go. The ending was theatrical and perfectly pitched in its rapid shifting of power dynamics and the will-they/won’t-they tightrope it walks. Everything that was carefully constructed paid off in a way that changed my opinion on the book, shifting it from being one of my least favorite of the DMS series to damn near the top of the list. I love it when you see an author grow and evolve, and now I eagerly await French’s return to the series she built her career on."
"3.5/5; 4 stars

I’ve been hearing about the Dublin Murder Squad for several years and, even though its dumb to start a series several books in, this audiobook fell into my lap so I took a chance.

I will be honest and say it was hard to spend so much time in the head of someone (Antoinette) who was so hostile, nasty and incapable of having a non confrontational conversation. I found it pretty hard to like that character, even though I began to understand and empathize with her throughout the course of the story.

The mystery was interesting but what really caught my interest was the nuts and bolts of the police investigation and brutal way they went after their suspect with no concern whatsoever about the effect on him. That was kind of disturbing but probably closer to reality than not. A lot of police procedurals don’t really capture the high emotion of these interviews but it was really well done in this book.

The audiobook was 18 hours long….probably about 8 hours too long for the amount of story but, overall, I enjoyed it."
"This is about stories; the ones we tell ourselves or others, one we want to believe, the one each of us construct our life around and sometimes the ones that push us closer toward the edge with no way to climb back up. We- even the realists, the sensors, the my-feet-are-on-the-concrete people, the what-the-use-of-fiction adults, are all storytellers, writers who with the absence of paper and pen make up stories inside our head. And all of those stories by different people whose path crossed each other are intertwined and tangled and could wind up into one same story; even so in the version that we create, every single one of us are always the protagonist; and so in this dream of a story, we try to bend reality, life into our plot and intentionally or unintentionally also other people's. The Trespasser is a picture of consequences, of how terrible things can become when we exchange reality with the shine of our story; and Tana French, as always, had done a fantastic job in capturing it.

P.S: Detective Antoinette Conway and Detective Stephen Moran has officially become one of my favorite crime investigator duo ever, would love it if there was a sequel of them."
"Another Dublin Murder Squad crime novel, again featuring the prickly, negatively emotional Antoinette Conway, and mild-mannered Steve Moran as the detectives on the case. This one is so much better than the French’s last DMS novel; it lacked the blinding frustration of inane characters and slow repetitive pacing of the last book.

This time Conway bitches through hundreds of pages with her usual dearth of compassion for anyone, especially the victim in this case. Fortunately, the story and other characters help lift it up out of that pit, and the sad story of the murder by boyfriend/guest of Aislinn Murray begins to work its magic on the reader.

I do hope Conway is left out of any subsequent books. Her end time realizations of what a jerk she has been and awkward apologies just don’t make up for having to deal with the character for most of the book.

Also I really wonder if these detectives “stories” with witnesses really work? In many instances they seem rather hokey, especially when the interviewee knows who is good D and bad D? 3.5*

"
"Tana French si riconferma essere una fantastica scrittrice di polizieschi, in questo libro emerge in particolar modo la sua bravura nel descrivere l’aspetto “procedurale” dell’indagine: come lavora una squadra della omicidi, come si interpretano le prove e soprattutto descrive gli interrogatori in maniera eccelsa. Il motivo per il quale non do a questo libro 5 stelle è che rispetto al suo precedessore (il collegio) ci sono degli aspetti che non mi hanno fatto impazzire: il libro è narrato questa volta da Conway e sinceramente ho trovato i suoi monologhi interni spesso fastidiosi, soprattuto perché il disprezzo che prova per la vittima sembra essere radicato più in una sua misoginia interiorizzata piuttosto che motivato da cose che Aislinn aveva veramente fatto. Un’altra cosa che mi ha fatto storcere il naso è stato il finale che ho trovato un po’ banale considerando il build up di 600 pagine per la rivelazione di una “cospirazione” all’interno del distretto e che si è rivelata fuffa totale (spiegata poi nelle 20 pagine finali)."
"4.5 I have read all of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad novels and a couple of her stand-alone novels, as well. I have enjoyed them all, but commonly think most crime/thriller novels should be a little better than they are (it's me, not the books...hahaha!) Faithful Place stood above all French's others to me, until now.

The Trespasser sucked me in! Detective Conway was fantastic even though she annoyed the piss out of me sometimes, or perhaps because she annoyed the piss out of me sometimes. The confusion she had with her relationships with the squad, and particularly with Stephen was written so well, as was the confusion she had about herself. I was cheering at the bold, unexpected way she handled her father. The accents, dialog and lingo were wonderful!

I had to force myself to disengage and get to bed a couple of hours past when I really should have. I still didn't want to, but at that point, I still had over 5 hours left. I had to stop myself!

Hands down, this is the best I've read by her and I am very much looking forward to the next one!"
"Antoinette Conway of the Dublin Murder Squad is working on a domestic murder with an obvious suspect. We know this suspect is not going to be the real murderer or if he is there are going to be red herrings and new revelations and we know that our suspect is going to be given a hard time whether he is guilty or not. After all The Trespasser comes in at just under 500 pages.

This is the second Antoinette Conway book and she is smart, brittle and difficult. Not liked in the squad. Carrying her own burdens.

But it is the sixth in the series and while I loved the cracking dialogue of the other books and the clever interviews I got the feeling that I had been here before in The Trespasser. The psychological twists and turns were a little bit hard to swallow. In the end she pulls it off with a brilliant interview/piece of writing which left me moved and impressed. It still earns its four stars but I hope French goes in another direction next book. Time to rest Conway at any rate."
"Once more Tana French produces a winning psychological thriller as part of her Dublin Murder Squad series. This murder case belongs to Antoinette Conway, the only female on the squad. She is partnered again with Stephen Moran (The Secret Place)but this book is her narrative and point-of-view. A young single woman is found dead in her own home. She had been preparing a special meal for a new beau called Rory Fallon. All circumstantial evidence points to Rory as the murderer but nothing hard sticks to Rory except the fact that he has been quasi-stalking Aislinn. Detective Conway is not well liked on the Murder Squad and when things start to go sideways, her personal paranoia kicks in. French shines here - her depiction of Conway's hysteria is pitch perfect. Also perfect is her ability to capture the shape and nuance of the Irish local gab, which is in this case -Dublin. Fewer holes plot wise in this one - a fine, fun read."
"This author has a real gift for creating worlds and a sense of place, despite the fact that I felt like I almost needed a translator for a lot of the Irish slang that she incorporated into the novel! Antoinette Conway - the book's main character - is a gritty, determined and no-nonsense Detective and the present-tense exploration of the case of Aislinn Murray is very well done. You feel as if you are right there with her, drawing connections and feeling preyed on by her own squad. I really appreciated the focus on stories and how we weave the ones we want to believe. French is very good at weaving an interesting story and taking you down paths before jumping over to another. I haven't read these books in order (having only read The Likeness up until now) but I intend to go and find the other novels in the series now. My only criticism is that the book had a very grey, paranoid and alone feeling to it, and the ending (while unpredictable) was perhaps not as satisfying as I had hoped. "
"Antoinette is a Murder Squad detective, and she and her partner Steve get a seemingly open and shut case. A call comes in that a woman has fallen and hit her head, and of course she's dead. It seems that the culprit is the anticipated date, for whom she was preparing dinner that night. He claims he came to the door and she never answered. As they investigate, they find other theories mean it's not as obvious a case as they had originally expected. Meanwhile, they're pretty much the outcasts of the department, so not only are they getting no help from their co-workers, but they're also throwing wrenches in along the way.
Pretty good book, I'm trying to work my way through the whole series, though not in order. It seems to work out okay, since they mostly have had different characters in them. Makes me wonder how large this squad is that they don't reappear in the novels. A lot of them seem to have back stories that remain undeveloped/explained."
"I had no idea this was part of a series so I dove in to the sixth novel headfirst! It has been a while since I have read a good crime novel and this one kept me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning.

The story is largely told through dialogue as the murder detectives conduct their investigation so there is a big focus on the characters and their interior lives. The tension keeps building and building as the investigation keeps encountering obstacles which makes this book hard to put down.

I also appreciated that the story is left slightly open-ended in terms of the end of the investigation, but the main character is forced to look at her own life differently as a result. Plot-wise you won't be given all of the answers, but Tana French loves her characters enough to tie up the emotional loose ends.

I give this book a 4/5 and look forward to reading other installments in the series!"
"I love Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad books and this one is no disappointment. If you’re unfamiliar with the series, the Dublin Murder Squad series follows different detectives investigating murders, the lead characters vary but will often have had more minor parts in earlier books. The relationships between the squad are very much the focus of the series, with the actual murders, in a way, being a more minor thing, although still a key part of the story. In this one, Conway and Moran, the token woman and the newbie, respectively, investigate a ‘slam dunk domestic’, saddled with golden boy Breslin, to keep an eye on them, so they don’t muck up. The crime doesn’t appear as simple as it seems, yet Breslin is keen for the pair to charge the obvious suspect, which raises questions as to exactly why? There’s a lot about some extreme workplace sexism and how people can control you if they can control your story, there’s also some extremely well written interview scenes."
"LONG! But good.
I love Tana French's books for how she really looks deep into how people tick, their deep-seated insecurities and arrogances. Her books have intriguing plots and it's always great to read a good murder mystery. Even though this one seemed pretty clear to me from the beginning, I got totally wrapped up in the characters. They're all so real, so human. At one point I got so angry at the protagonist I wanted to stop reading. She was so lost in her own assumptions it was infuriating.
This book really is about stories. The stories we tell ourselves about the world to help us cope, whether those stories are based in reality or not. So fascinating!

The narrator on this book did a great job. I could have listened to the book at a faster speed, but I didn't want to; it deserved a regular pace to savour and enjoy. I listened on my walks, and it was sore feet that took me home each time, because I could have listened to this one straight through."
"(4.5, really) So I've now finished the six book series of Dublin Murder Squad mysteries by Tana French. I haven't been as enamored of her stand-alone books (The Witch Elm, The Searcher), but dang! I love these DMS novels. I don't think I could rate them least favorite to most favorite; not one of them failed to reel me in. French excels in telling a great story, revealing information piece by piece just as the detectives discover things and put the puzzle together. They theorize and then toss out unworkable theories, keeping the reader's mind working just as hard as they are. Each book features a different detective, and French writes males and females equally well. The detectives are passionate but flawed and thoroughly drawn. And here's where I really gush: French is masterful at writing interrogation scene dialogues. They can go on for pages, but they zip along, capturing the emotions of every individual in the scene. (Ms. French, won't you please write another DMS tale?)"
"I love Tana French, and I really love the Murder Squad books. That being said, I just don't like Antoinette Conway. I want to like her---she's smart, she's tough, she's dedicated to her job. What I find is that she's such a one-note character (defensive, aggressive, almost always looking for a fight in some way) that I don't find her sympathetic or interesting enough to really care about her. In this book, I actually found myself getting annoyed with her because of her constant harping (internally, mostly) about how the whole squad was against her. It got old, even after she realized that she'd manufactured so much of it in her own head. She was so similar to the way she was in The Secret Place, I found that I just didn't want to read her diatribes anymore.

All of which is too bad, because this book has a solid twist to it, and I would actually have liked to have learned a lot more about the the murderee and the murderer.



"
"I read a lot of crime and there are about four authors who I follow by reading everything they write. Tana French is one of them. She is consistently good. Her books are consistently good reads. While I prefer a slightly heavier plot, the character-driven substance of her stories is really solid. The Trespasser is, for me, a bit heavy on the internal thoughts of the main character, particularly in the first half of the book. The story also tends to go on a few tangents, which is expected when detectives follow leads, but that risks the reader fading away. Given these minor problems - just my problems, of course - the relational tensions and twists and turns keep you turning the page. The last part of the story was amazing. All of the bits of the puzzle begin to fall together, there are twists and turns and the finale extraordinary and inspiring. Conway and Moran are inspirational in keeping to the job, despite the challenges around them and their own self-doubts. An excellent read."
"As many of Tana French’s characters say, Jaysus! That was a helluva ride that crackled from start to
finish. There was never a point in which the pacing was off or I found myself wondering how there were still another 200 pages to go.

The characters were stellar and real-life; it was interesting to be in DI Antoinette Conway’s head, even when she had run unto obstacles or approached things in a way not everyone does. It’s been awhile since I read #5 in the series, in which DI Conway’s partner, Stephen Moran, is the driver. It would be interesting to go back and hear his POV now that we’ve heard hers.

As always, Tana French has an amazing here for dialogue and sneaks in poetic flights when you least expect it. She really is a gifted writer and seems to be improving her game as she goes along. I’ve now read all of the Dublin Murder Squad books, as well as the standalones and am itching for another book from her."
"It's been a long time since I picked up a Dublin Murder Squad book, but I was in the mood for a broody mystery, so I raced to the library to see what Tana had available and realized this was the only book in the series I hadn't read. While I don't think this is Tana's best book, it's still a great mystery with great pacing, and I just love how she writes. I found some of the twists and turns in this book a little predictable, but I like how even when things seem obvious there's enough other stuff going on that you kind of have to think whether you're falling for a red herring and then just let the mystery unfold. I liked Antoinette as a protagonist, even if I found some of her decisions to be dumb, but I like that we have another female detective, which iirc hasn't happened since Book 2. I don't know if I'll remember this book forever and always, but I had a good time reading it, and this did energize me to see what else Tana has been up to since the Dublin Murder Squad series. "
"Non conoscevo French ed ero curioso di leggere qualcosa ambientata a Dublino. Tana French è un'eccellente scrittrice che sa costruire una storia con basi solidissime, abitandola di personaggi credibili, molto ben descritti, inserendola in un contesto urbano dei meno noti ( almeno dai tempi dei ""Dubliners"") e riesce a fare tutto ciò narrando una storia di polizia, ovvero raccontando la vita di quelli che sono la polizia. Ma non solo. Ok d'accordo, niente di speciale, abbiamo la mente affollata di ispettori, commissari, agenti, detective etc. French non ha inventato niente, ma è sicuramente molto brava nel rielaborare le lezioni dei passati maestri. E sa come tenerti incatenato per 600 e passa pagine con un ritmo sostenuto e falsopiani che ti fanno mettere comodo e pregustare una facile conclusione a metà per poi cambiare strada e svoltare per un vicolo buio senza nessuna uscita, tranne....
Molto brava Tana French, quattro stelle piene al suo Intruso"
"I've never read Tana French before, but her crime fiction books come heavily recommended to me by family friends. French's Dublin Murder Squad series act as standalone novels, and starting with the sixth in this series, I certainly did not feel as I had missed out on any prior important info needed to understand it. The book very much plays out like a Brit Box murder mystery show, with two Dublin detectives leading a realistic investigation into the death of a young woman inside her home. Given that the steps to uncover the culprit are done in a practical manner, the investigation starts quite slow and took me about 25% to really get into. But by the halfway point, things were flowing. Overall, this is a rare crime book in that it truly seems to take place in the world of reality, but as such, drags at certain points in the investigation, like it would in an actual investigation. I enjoyed the story, but also wouldn't have minded a slightly more condensed version ;) "
"Four and a half stars!

Detective Antoinette Conway's job is murder and she is barely hanging on after two years working on the Murder Squad. Her dream job has become a nightmare where she trusts no one, except perhaps her partner Detective Stephen Moran. Her other co-workers on the Squad are not to be trusted, she feels, and are sabotaging her at every turn. When Conway and Moran are handed yet another domestic dispute gone bad case she feels this will be her swan song with the Squad. However, the case is anything but routine and Antoinette is soon embroiled in a situation with surprising ramifications. Who can she trust, which version of the facts are true and how will justice be served? Tana French's latest is a page turner with muscular writing which will leave you breathless in its complexity. What a writer!
"
"As is the case with others in this series, the focus is as much on the psychology of the investigators as it is on solving the murder. In this case, the lead detective is the only female on the squad and, due to a number of severe hazing incidents, she's well convinced that no one really likes her except maybe her rookie partner, and she's not sure about him.

They catch a case at the end of a long night shift -- at first glance it appears to be a 'routine' death during a domestic disturbance, but things aren't quite adding up and the third detective assigned to help them seems to muddying the waters further. Ultimately, figuring out who killed her depends on finding out as much as they can the victim's life and history. Along the way they learn a lot about themselves and what's REALLY been going on among the detectives in the squad."
"I love this series for so many reason. The stories are not neat. You get only the smallest amount of satisfaction with the outcome, but the ride is so fast and so fun. I usually read her books in the fall or winter, I'm not sure why, but something lends itself to the bleakness that is November or February. I was in the mood to visit with the Murder D's so I pick this one up despite the summer sun. It still gave me the feeling of needing to curl up with something warm. If you like a messy mystery, strong but flawed characters, well written prose but don't want the crazy that is scandinavian mysteries, I urge you to pick up one of her novels. You don't need to read them in order, so don't worry if book 1 isn't on the shelf. Just give yourself a chunk of time because you will definitely get pulled in. "
"I conclude I really, really like Tana French!

In ""The Trespasser"", a Barbie-doll type woman is murdered. While the evidence seems to point to the woman's boyfriend, our heroine Detective Conway (minority^2 stuck in a hostile working environment),and her puppy-like sidekick are not so sure.

This is the 5th of French's books I read and she just continues to impress. Set in an atmospheric Dublin that jumps out at you, she elegantly combines classic mystery/thriller with psychological drama. She touches on all my favorite topics: belonging (or not), identity, paranoia, being so stuck in one's head it's hard to know what's real and what's not, and relationships, but in a very unconventional way. Characters are beyond ""like/dislike""; in either case you care, so much that reading becomes quite stressful.

Highly recommended author, putting her on my watch-list."
"I wish Goodreads let you do 1/2 stars because this one was a 3.5 for me. I rounded up to a 4 because the more I thought about it, the more I appreciated it. There wasn't as much action in this book as her previous books which was why I initially didn't love it the way I have her other books. However, I realized that the dialogue was so realistic and specific that she created a world in which I felt I was eavesdropping the entire time. And that takes talent. It was like reading the very best possible Law & Order. And once again, you really do get a firm grasp on the characters to the point where you find yourself smiling and thinking, well, of COURSE this character would say that or react that way. That has always been Tana French's magic, the character development (which includes her skill with dialogue) and in that sense I wasn't disappointed at all."
"The Trespasser by Tana French follows the plot of many other murder mysteries and psychological thrillers but was still cunningly different and impressive. This was my first read by Tana French, and I didn’t quite know what to expect. French writes with an Irish twang making the main character, Detective Conway, that much more interesting to follow.

Conway represents everything we want in the main character from strength to brains to wit as well as fighting for her place on the Dublin murder squad. Her sarcasm and charisma almost make the reader forget that a gruesome murder had taken place. Yet, still, French captivated me with the dark, twisted voice narrating just how manipulative the mind can be.

Filled with many twists and turns, The Trespasser, is wonderful for those who enjoy psychological thrillers. I will definitely be reading more of her books.
"
"I've been fortunate to read the Dublin Murder Squad books in order and follow the transition of protagonists from book to book.

I listened to the audio version of this book which comes complete with accents for all characters, including Antoinette Conway's internal dialogue.

French's books are lengthy and detailed, in this case giving the reader a very good idea of what is going on inside Antionette's head. Everything in the story is filtered through her perspective: from interactions with her partner, other Ds in the Murder Squad, floaters, uniforms, etc; to reviews of evidence and witness interviews.

The Trespasser pulls on threads attempting to connect an old missing-person case to the murder of Aislin Murray. At the same time, there is the convenient presence of a new suitor. Definitely a police procedural and French lays out the story well."
"I actually picked up The Trespasser while on my honeymoon after exchanging it for The Readymade Thief. This is not a book I would have selected on my own, as I've never particularly gravitated towards crime or police procedural novels and I've never read any Tana French before. That said, I really enjoyed this book and blew through it quickly.

French's protagonist Detective Conway's voice is wry, biting and smart. Her working relationship with her partner Detective Moran, both relative newbies on the Dublin Murder Squad, serves as the backbone to this murder mystery, giving the reader an insight into both of their tender spots. The pacing of this novel is excellent, and the murder mystery at the heart of the novel is compelling enough, with enough layers to be peeled back to keep me intrigued. As this book progressed towards its finale, I found that I cared just as much about the protagonist's personal struggles with her place on the squad just as much as figuring out ""who did it"" - a testament to French's wonderful character work.

Highly recommend this novel to fans of the genre and beyond. Grateful to have discovered French and I look forward to digging into more of her work."
"449 pages makes for a long audiobook (18 cds - 21 hours) The Trespasser by Tana French “Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran, catch a murder case that looks like another lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Other detectives try to push them into arresting the boyfriend. But some things don’t add up. And why are the other detectives pushing so hard? Can Conway still do her job with all of the harassment and hazing? Who killed Aislinn Murray?” This is my first Tana French book. The audiobook performer did an outstanding job - makes you feel like you’re sitting there with them in the Incident Room at the Dublin Murder Squad. There are some twists along the way as they try to find the killer. And an interesting look at how far loyalty should go. Very intense and thorough. A third of the way through and they were still on the first day. Good read from French."
"I really enjoy Tana French's Murder Squad series, and this installment is no exception.

Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran tackle their latest assignment, the murder of Aislinn Murray. It appears to be a slam-dunk the-boyfriend-did-it case, but the inconsistencies lurking around the edges keep hinting at another solution. Conway and Moran poke at the inconsistencies, start running into roadblocks, and begin to suspect corrupt cops and organized crime are somehow connected to the murder. Then the constant harrassment and pranks Conway suffers in the squad room lead her to believe her partner is sabotaging their case.

Antoinette Conway is a difficult character to like, and the whole Murder Squad comes off as an abusive dysfunctional unit. That makes this a rough read. But persevere. It's worth it in the end."
"What’s not to love about an excellent mystery novel? Sometimes you just need to shove your face in a book you can’t put down. Television is grand, but. Television is interrupted by text messages, the NYT crossword app, knitting projects. There is something so all encompassing about a gritty page-turner that it brings me back straight to childhood, straight to reading used paperbacks til four in the morning. I can commend Tana French for being a fantastic writer, for nailing the nuance of real conversation, for tight plotting, for a lot of things—I mostly just want to thank her for reminding me how much fucking fun reading is.

Also, I know that friendship makes the world go round but if Detectives Conway and Moran don’t end up in a dark hotel room together at some point in my lifetime the whole thing is bollixed, yeah?"
"This was the first Tana French novel in my current binge of her work that I hadn't read before, so I'm not sure if it was that combined with having picked it up literal minutes after finishing The Secret Place or something more intrinsic to the book itself that meant I could not for the life of me keep it straight that Antoinette was the narrator rather than Steve. I sorted it out eventually but for the first half of the book I kept having to catch myself and realign my visualization of what was going on.

All that said, this book was excellent. No scent of magic realism in this one unless you really want to reach and count the identity of the person lurking around Antoinette's house, which was, oddly for French, something that seemed forced and out of place. (Her novels generally flow so perfectly.)

Those complaints aside, this book was great. On to the next!"
"This was my first Tana French after hearing a lot about her and overall I liked this book. Basically, as with any police procedural book a body is found. In this book the case was handed over to the rookies of the murder squad, Antoinette and her partner Steve. At first, they weren't thrilled with getting the case because it looked like routine domestic violence. But, over time, they realized there was way more to the story. I can't say too much or I'll ruin the mystery/suspense so I'll stop there.

I liked Antoinette's character a lot she was tough all the while taking a lot of hazing for being a female cop. She never backed down even when things in the case got really complicated and major implications for her career were introduced.

I listened to this book on audio and I loved that they used an Irish narrator to bring more realness to the Dublin murder squad. This book is one of a large serious that can be read in any order. I already have another one in the series at home waiting to be picked up.

I would recommend this book if you are in need of a good, solid, read."
"This was definitely my favorite in the series. Antoinette was so maddening sometimes, with her inability/unwillingness to find comfort in anything or anyone, and yet I felt so bad for her for the same reason. The murder itself was the best one in terms of being believable and not convoluted. And I was so glad that she found satisfaction in the end, and Stephen turned out to be a stand-up guy.

And even though Antoinette's dad turned out to be a jerk, he had a line that made me actually cry - something about after his parents died, that he understood why it was so important to root his own story in a larger story. Then I realized that I am actually guilty of the same thing as Antoinette, not to the nth degree as she was but I can be, deep down, mistrustful of people's motives and staying power.

I hope there's another one soon!"
"I quite enjoyed this novel, the first I've read from Tana French. I am a big fan of character development, and consequently, how I feel about the leads can be enough to keep me glued to the pages or swapping for another. I don't have to love them, but I have to feel connected or interested by them. This happened for me.

I also tend to enjoy longer books more. French was able to keep things moving in a way that had me deciding just to read until the next break. There were a few spots I struggled with, but that may have been because I stayed up too late.

In short, I would pass this book on for someone else to read and continue with the series. In her short essay, French says she switches her narrator with each book and I am intrigued by the leading and supporting characters trading off. My expectations are hopeful."
"Tana French's police procedurals do not disappoint. The plot of The Trespasser makes the reader work a bit, traveling down blind alleys and chasing down disappointing leads along with the lead detectives on the case. What sets her novels at the top of the genre, to my mind, is her ability to place you in the interview room so that you experience the anxious smell emanating from the suspect, the texture of the frayed rug, the buzzing of a fluorescent light in the room; you can feel the detectives' duplicity and the cadence of their practiced interrogation routines. There is an authenticity to her settings and dialogues that places them above the whodunnit whose pages you turn but whose formulaic quality leaves you wanting. This was my third Tana French mystery. It certainly won't be my last."
"At just under 500 pages, The Trespasser is long, but takes little time in bringing together clues for the murder of Aislinn. I didn't realize they were clues until I got further into the book and thought ""Oh so that's why that happened or was said"". In my opinion, Tana French has crafted a well planned/written story with characters you like (Antoinette and Steve) and others you'd love to punch in the face, just as Antoinette does. This is another author for me to keep an eye on, along with quite a few readers from my city. Currently ""In The Woods"", the first book in Dublin Murder Squad series, has over 20 people on a holds list through our council library system. My name is on the list as well, I'll probably not read it till much later this year. I really enjoyed this book and I hope you do too. "
"Detective Antoinette Conway has attitude and justifiably so, working in the Murder Squad with a bunch of guys out to cause her grief any way that they can. Fortunately, she can count on her partner, Detective Stephen Moran, to have her back. Or can she? Is he just trying to keep the waters calm so he can one day advance into the ranks of the accepted Murder D's? Conway is almost hyper-paranoid in her reactions to her squad mates, and it colors everything that she does. This book had my head all twisted around. Even toward the end, it was hard to tell just who had done what or knew what or saw what. So in that respect, it was a successful mystery. Tana French's books are hard to put down, and this one was no exception. I'm glad it ended the way it did, and thank God for the gaffer and his common sense!"
"⭐️4/5 STARS⭐️

-Well, let’s start off with saying Tana French writes wonderful stories that make your mind wonder from one through to another, while making you want to read her books back to back. You can tell French really thinks about the story she wants others to read and stay attached to. With all that being said, I will have to say that this is my least favorite book I’ve read from her collection.
-
-
-why do I say that? It took me so long to really grasp the events and story of what was going on in The Trespasser. It has a very slow start with no heart-pumping, chill bump, eye catcher. I kept waiting for it, but I couldn’t find one, but I knew once I started this book, I couldn’t just stop half way through.
-
-
-The idea of this story was great, but I probably won’t be picking up this book to read again anytime soon.

"Detective Antoinette embodies all the characteristics of a cliché cop that we end up having a love hate relationship with. She believes that the otherwise male dominated unit is out to get her and she has reasons to believe so. She is always handed petty and straightforward cases so when she does get a case that looks like an instance of domestic violence gone wrong, she can't help but dwell deeper. The case has a lot many ties and gets more and more complicated and implicates people who she never imagined she'd have to face. Is this a trap to cause her fall or is this the breakthrough that she needs to make her mark? The book is a big one and has its highs and lows. The lead character is quite irritating with her constant paranoia but I guess that's just a part of the deal. Overall, it was a decent read though not a mind blowing one. "
"not a big fan of cop-aganda which is unfortunately a lot of the detective-focused mystery fare, but this one at the very least complicates it in a number of ways. had only read one other Tana French before this and liked it but was not blown away, but this read has me rethinking that: the characters here are so lived-in, the universe so complete, the mystery just twisty enough, and the dialogue is thrilling. what a long, slow book but in a way that felt worthwhile and fun -- you can sink into these scenes and stay there. wish our narrator weren't as completely obviously cruel to the world around her for seemingly no reason throughout the book, but at least glad to be given multiple Daughters Missing Dads narratives here that play out differently. all around made me want to pick up another by French, and was well worth the investment of time to read it."
"This is the 4th Tana French book I've read, and this one was the least interesting to me. The first half of the book was so slow; it seemed nothing was happening at all besides Detective Antoinette Conway feeling paranoid about the Murder Squad having it in for her. I never got why on earth they were pursuing a gang connection and when that direction finally fell by the wayside, things picked up considerably. The second half of the book was more fast-paced and interesting as suspicions began to fall on other people besides the original suspects.

For the first half, I could barely get myself to pick up the book and continue, but by the second half, I couldn't put it down. :-)

Still, the other three books I read, The Likeness, In the Woods, and The Secret Place, grabbed my attention and held it throughout. I don't think any book compares to The Likeness, my all time favorite."
"Excellent police procedural. A solid 5 for fans. The author is very skilled at drawing complicated characters and allowing the reader to witness how their thinking evolves. Police interrogations were mesmerizing, other reviewers thought they were too long – the eejits! – they were the best part! The missing Dad reference was a nice twist. It made me realize what a dark place the police and prosecutors have to work in every day and how over time that must affect their view of the world. Not having the support of your “brothers” must be gut twisting. I struggled a bit with the Irish slang, so many gaffs or gaffers, and eejits, and the Kindle doesn’t always point you in the right direction. Silly perhaps, but I wished there was a “slang index”. No wonder Ms French has such a devoted following. "
"This one was intriguing, and an interesting POV change. Conway’s sharp wit was fun. I especially liked slimy Breslin. But it wasn’t perfect.

It was one too many long dialogues — there was a lot of storytelling by each character, and a lot of filling in of gaps by Conway and her partner. This left the “solve” feeling a bit try-hard.

I also felt some whiplash on how we’re supposed to feel about Conway, her colleagues, and the police in general. Do we hate the others on the squad? Is Moran a useless partner if he never sticks up for Conway? Is Conway actually just a pain in the butt? And yet they all still “back the blue” when it comes to dealing with the journo?

But maybe the whiplash is the point — in feeling this, we understand the unsteady place that Conway feels she occupies, as well. She can’t trust her instincts, and neither can the reader."
"Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are the lowest rung detectives at the Dublin murder squad. Still considered rookies, they have to put up with a constant stream of crappy cases, pranks and harassment. Their latest case looks like a typical domestic: Aislinn Murray is found dead at the scene of a romantic dinner except Antoinette knows she’s seen her before. Everything they find out about Aislinn points her further away from the Barbie persona she’s put on in death. The murderer may be a lot closer than Antoinette thinks. This was an interesting twist on your typical police procedural. Antoinette definitely had a HUGE chip on her shoulder (partially for good reason, partially because that’s who she is) and it was a little grating to keep reading her complaints. That being said, I did really empathize with Antoinette and she was kind of a badass to read about. "
"I was eager to listen to the audiobook of this the sixth and final novel (for now) in the Dublin Murder squad Series. Once again the reader captured the first-person voice of the story-teller in a way which enhanced and expanded what was happening in the story. I've learned that these books are not electrifying page burners, but rather mysteries which unfold amidst compliated relationships, dark motives and what I imagine is rather authentic dective work. The plot had twists-some of which had much buildup with little payoff. And I have mixed feeling about how satisfied I am with the resolution. Having completed the series - with only hearing the last two as audiobooks, I am going back to the start to listen and gain more from those stories then when can be gained by simply imagining the voices of the characters."
"3.5

Not my favourite of this excellent author's books. The character development is r.e.a.l.l.y stretched out this time, and I wonder if it was necessary. There's absolutely no space for the reader to fill in the blanks; every detail of the main characters' nature/thoughts/more is presented. I like a bit more subtlety, especially when a character is as flawed -- and then open to redemption -- as the lead/narrator, detective Conway. She's an angry woman, with good reason, and her anger was blinding both to her detecting and to this reader.

But credit to the author, everything was neatly sewn up.

The first third of the book is excruciating. If you make it past that, it's a great read. Gets exciting halfway through, both in terms of the mystery/police issue, as well as the characters.

"
"It was bittersweet to finish this book. I was eager to get to the end and see what happened to characters I'd grown to like, but I also knew that finishing it meant finishing the series (at least for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure how I happened across the first of the series, In the Woods, but I was hooked and have slowly read my way through the rest of the series.

The Trespasser was a fitting (for now ) ending for the series. I seemed to move through this novel faster than I had some of the others. I love French's writing, but it can be quite dense at times. I'm not sure if this book was more swiftly paced or if I just got up a head of steam. But all the elements of the series are present here: a palpable sense of time, place, and character, and a deep dive into the psyches of the characters."
"the Trespasser has a really novel setup: a black female detective with demonstrated skills is trying to make in the Murder department and solve the newest case with her younger male partner but she is surrounded with the very definition of a harassing environment: someone pisses in her locker, dunks her phone in coffee, steals a witness statement and her sense of paranoia becomes massive. Yet the case thrown at her is much more complicated than expected with no quick solve around the corner. The portrait of this detective is so finessed that I imagine the author based her on someone she met. In total, another satisfying mystery from Tana French, going where few mystery writers have gone before."
"Any book that I can't put down gets four stars minimum.

This one has a steely female detective at the center with a chip on her shoulder that makes her tough as any bloke on the Dublin Murder Squad. The lads give her plenty of hazing but she gets the solve in the end after numerous twists.

The victim gets punched to death in her own apartment and several suspects pass before us. I love the Irish dialect, especially when they invert the conjunction. Instead of saying, ""I walked by her house, but I didn't see her,"" they say, ""I walked by her house. I didn't see her, but.""

The pacing is first rate. It doesn't lag and you get just enough enticement from one scene to keep you eager for the next one.

TF at the top of her game."
"This book was a very long read and the action tended to move slowly. But, I have always enjoyed this Dublin Murder Squad series and I really get to know the characters with Tana French's writing style. That is what kept me coming back to the book and enjoying it. I have not worked in law enforcement, but I imagine the careful collection of evidence and putting together a sound case are things that take a lot of time and must be done with care. Meanwhile, the detectives and other people involved in the case have lives that they lead and must carry on with their personal efforts as they are working their cases. This is why I have always enjoyed Tana French's books. She makes me think and I care about her characters."
"Enjoyed this book a lot, even though Antoinette sometimes got to be a little too negative, and too stuck in her own head. Then again, the author did a good job with showing how everyone has a story they're telling themselves and sometimes how we see ourselves is quite different from how we are perceived by others.

The story centers around two young murder detectives, who haven't been on the squad long enough to prove themselves or be fully accepted by the other detectives. As an added complication, Antoinette is subjected to hazing (some of it caused by the fact that she is the only woman on the squad) which causes her to treat everyone on the squad with distrust. The pair is assigned a murder case which at first seems like a slam-dunk, until an alternative story line emerges."
"Whoa. Antoinette Conway is one tough cookie. Maybe Raven or Xena would be a better first name. I had minor surgery after starting this book and had to put it down for a few days, but otherwise I would have tried to read it straight through. I felt like the author trusted me, and I learned what was going on along with the protagonist--my main beef with mysteries is authors who keep secrets from the readers and suddenly tie everything up neatly because their characters know something important, but we aren't privy to it until the last scene or two.

There was a subplot that seemed a little forced and a bit too much swearing for my taste, but strong characters, a plot that moved along and great interrogation scenes. And a bonus: I learned some Irish slang. Gaffer= boss, gaff= house.
"
"French is really brilliant at developing characters and writing scenes. Sometimes an interrogation scene rises and falls like a hurricane even though on some level it consists merely of three people in a small room talking.

The underlying plot - the murder and he whodunnit part - is never fully convincing. I'm never sure with French whether any of the people in the case would really act as they did. The case breaks around just having one more conversation which could have been had dozens and dozens of pages earlier. (Of course that leaves less room for brilliant interrogation scenes.). The device that keeps it forestalled seemed artificial to me.

So, four or four and a half. The audio version is brilliant by the way - one of the best narrations ever."
"I really enjoyed this book. It is LONG...the audible version is more than 20 hours so it took lots of driving back and forth to the lake and Indy to get through. It's based in Dublin where they call homicide detectives ""murder"" detectives, hence the Dublin murder squad, and focuses on one murder, so it's not much of a thriller but thrilling enough to keep me listening. It took me awhile to get used to the narrator's thick Irish accent, but once I did, I liked her a lot. The author, Tana French, has a very rich writing style, lots of descriptions. It's really pretty, but a bit much at times. Either way, I recommend the book and plan to read the others in this series as well as others by the author."
" The Trespasser, a wonderful cop story set in Ireland that keeps you on the edge of your seat, revolves around Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran who are attached to the Murder Squad. Solving the murder of a young woman has been assigned to them which they hadn't expected. When they try to take their time solving the case so the most logical suspect isn't thrown in the slammer by mistake, those over them push for the case to be solved pronto. Despite the undue pressure mounting in their department, Moran and Conway continue to dig into the victim's life and discover other important facts-including another boyfriend the victim kept secret. Would anything come of that? "
"I am not usually one for excessive detail and word count, but somehow, even though the writing was super dense, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. A murder mystery always has the potential to be shallow and cheesy but The Trespasser was anything but. Character development was superb and the story line was exciting and kept me guessing but was also realistic enough that I was completely satisfied with the happy enough ending. The main character was spunky and swore a lot as she tried to hold her own in a male dominated career. Because the author is from Dublin I got to learn some great new expressions. Like, ""Shut your gob."" Loved her sass. Probably one of the best murder mysteries I've read all year. I recommend it. "
"I was looking for something light (brain candy) and Tana French, as usual, provided a terrific tale that held me spellbound. I suspect that homicide detectives must be suspicious by nature, as so many people lie to them. Add to that a toxic work environment, and it's easy to see how paranoia could creep in. In this gripping police procedural, Detective Antoinette Conway trusts no one as she tries to unravel the murder of a young woman. She develops multiple stories, and suspects, witnesses and colleagues feed her alternative stories, alternative facts, everyone competing to offer a convincing tale. The reader is kept wondering as well, and changing perspectives as each new piece of evidence is uncovered. A really good police procedural.
"
"I used to never read detective stories, but I’ve become quite enamored with Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series. Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran, who first worked together in French’s The Secret Place, are now officially partners. Early one morning, about to go off duty after working the overnight shift, they are assigned a new case and also a mentor for this case, a veteran detective neither Conway nor Moran are fond of. At first the case seems straightforward, a young woman undoubtedly killed by her boyfriend, but some of the evidence doesn’t add up, and why the mentor? Eventually, of course, the reason comes to light and the partners are surprised to also learn why they were assigned to this case when it would have made sense for it to go to someone else. "
"I do enjoy this series. In this installment, Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are sent to investigate a domestic disturbance. When they arrive, they find a young woman dead in her house with no sign of an intruder. Their supervising officer has also assigned an older, well-known detective to work the case with them - a ""big shot"" blowhard who neither can stand.

The investigation takes them back and forth with suspicions, scenarios, and suspects until they realize that the murderer may be one of their own.

This was a true psychological thriller. The characters are very well developed, and Antoinette Conway is a woman in a traditionally male job who faces sexism and discrimination, as well as her own personal demons along the way."
"Ms. French has re-united the pair of detectives from ""The Secret Place"" - Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran. These two work very well together almost reading each other's minds. Watch them in an interrogation or just in a conversation with a journalist. Amazing. And stay away if you don't want your mind messed with, for French's dialogue/thoughts mixed closely together will play with your mind. It will make you a little nervous about being interviewed by her or any cop, frankly. It was fun to arrive at some of the same conclusions just a page before the reveal, but as one reviewer put it ""When reading this ... novel, assume nothing"". Some might find the ending disappointing, but I think it is real."
"Tana French writes a helluva story. It’s a slow build actually but the last quarter of the book moves at fast pace and the it becomes “unputdownable” (coining a word perhaps).

While the murder plot is intriguing it’s the character of Antoinette Conway that propels the story. She’s angry, insecure, tough, defensive, replete with unresolved daddy issues. Her personal story intertwines with the victim’s. Both have the habit of spinning fanciful tales around life’s difficulties and challenges. Antoinette just colors her stories as dark as a moonless midnight.

If you’re looking for a gritty story where the protagonist isn’t always likable but always relatable and the mystery more than keeps one’s interest then this is a great read.
"
"I love the characters and the Dublin setting. I also really cared about the plot and felt invested in the outcome. I enjoyed getting a look at the inner workings of the murder squad. It’s really cool when an author makes me root for an unlikeable character.

My main problem with this book is one of pacing. There were parts that I would think, “get on with it already” and then parts that had me wishing for an extra subway stop so I could keep reading. The dialogue creeped along the line into cheesy, cliched and over the top more than a few times.

I recommend this to anyone who likes detective series that are driven by kinda damaged female detective protagonists. And also if you’re not from Ireland and like international detective stories."
"The Trespasser came highly recommended on several ""must read"" lists and no wonder: it is truly an amazing story.
Set in Dublin, Ireland, with a boat-load of delightful colloquialisms, it is the story of a young woman murdered by a punch to the face and fall in her own living room. Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner are tasked with tracking down the killer, but there seem to be many obstacles in her way, most of which are created by her own colleagues.
A gripping but very slow paced story, The Trespasser is not for the faint of heart or flighty reader - you really have to devote yourself to a good, long slog through the twists and turns of the investigation. But it will be worth it!"
"I have found that I really enjoy this book series. The Irish accent on the audio books is a plus. But the real enjoyment of this series is the real feeling of what working on an Irish murder squad must be like with all of the office politics and political minefields involved. The plot is intricate and I can never quite figure things out until the author wants me to. But it is not done obviously by withholding critical information that would normally be obtained in a normal investigation as I have seen with some authors. All the information is there, but different aspects are emphasized and different takes are explored adding to the mystery of the story. The languages a little crass, but somehow it comes across less offensive when masked by an Irish accent. An enjoyable read. "
"Just finished this book and I find myself thinking through the plot premise if the stories we weave anout ourselves. I haven't read any of the other series books, si Im new to the characters. That may have enhanced my understanding if the main characters; but it wasn't necessary. The detectives are tasked with a probable domestic violence murder that forces them to closely evaluate the ""stories"" of the suspects and victims. What starts as a novel transends into personal reflection. Who is the victim? Who are the suspects? Who are the detectives? What stories do we tell ourselves as part of our identity? Thoughtfully crafted with great insight into the police investigative process and the detectives involved in the solution."
"Another good yarn by Tana French. No spoilers here, but the ending wasn't as surprising as I thought it might be. While not completely predictable, it played out over a long stretch at the end. Sometimes the author fell into lengthy descriptions of day to day things, which usually serves to maintain a story's context and setting, but sometimes I felt it got in the way of the story itself. That said, the characters are real, and well developed. The story itself is believable, and it does send the reader down various paths in the nature of good whodunnits. And one of those paths ends up being the solution (no spoilers here...). A good book, well worth the investment of time in reading it. Enjoyable, and I'll no doubt read more of the author's work. "
"This is my first Tana French novel. A thriller/suspense book agent had recommended her. At present, I’m writing a first person thriller/suspense story and, as my characters head to a climax point in Act One I strained against the problem of not being able to see into my villain’s head. French’s story literally throbs inside the head of her detective. Her descriptions of her surroundings are beautiful, unique, sometimes metaphysical in their sense of impending doom and, when French layers and layers her descriptions the reader comes away with something truly never-read before. I was engrossed for much of the book, only feeling it was overwritten a few times and that passed quickly as the narrative leaped into another scene.

I am definitely a fan of Tana French’s writing."
"A book much more about the detective than the case. In fact, the case isn't even that interesting, it's more how it affects the main character that drives you forward to keep turning the pages. Which is a new experience for me in detective fiction.

Yes, it's all a bit broad strokes and drawn on a little too long and needlessly complex and winding. But liteeally every detective story I've read has that. Tis the genre.

French has a great mind for psychology and the depth she feels she can bring to the rote detective story gives an assurance to a genre that can feel too twist-driven or rote.

If I'm looking for well-written thrillers that are quite a step above the usual grade, that get me to care? Can't think of a better writer doing it now."
I have loved every single book in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. Her characters are entertaining and lively. Her plots are spot on and genius. Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are given what appears to be an open and shut case of a lover's spat that ended in murder. Aislinn Murray is found with her head smashed into her fireplace hearth. If the case is so easy why did the chief assign another more senior detective to work with Antoinette and Stephen? The pressure to arrest the victim's boyfriend intensifies but Antoinette and Stephen have serious doubts about his guilt. Antoinette fears this will be her last case as a member of the Dublin Murder Squad. She also wonders if she can truly trust Stephen after they waste days chasing down fantastical theories and false leads. 
"This was actually my first Tana French novel - I just randomly picked it up in the library and didn’t realize it was part of a series! Will have to go back and check out the others.

Overall, I loved The Trespasser . The character development was amazing - each character is presented as a really complex and 3 dimensional human and it’s really interesting to understand them through the narration of Antoinette Conway, a “savagely tough” murder detective who feels disillusioned by her job and alienated by her squad. The plot was interesting, and the writing style was fast paced and engaging. The only reason I’m giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that it kind of dragged in the middle and felt unnecessarily long, but the last 100 pages or so definitely made up for it :)"
"While this book might get lumped into the crime-thriller category, it reads very differently from others in genre. It does have several cliffhangers and is a well-rounded mystery, but it relies heavily on the intense psychological showdowns that take place in the police station. The protagonist, while ill-tempered, foul-mouthed, and possibly a little too vain, is an endearing and powerful character who you want to succeed, even as she inadvertently seems to sabotage herself. The author does an excellent job of building tension and sewing discord, and never letting the reader see who we can finally trust until the end. It was my first experience reading Tana French, and based on this, I would definitely like to read more."
"I liked the first third and the last third, but felt the middle third was frustrating. I really enjoy the various ways that Tana French makes her narrators into unreliable narrators, mostly revolving around different levels of dislike we may have for them. This one was different though. In this one, Detective Conway, who is sharp as can be and always on top of things in the Secret Place, is somewhat oblivious to things, and that is frustrating. The story resolves itself, and I did like the ending quite a bit, but I docked it one star for being frustrating in the middle. My final list of preference for the Dublin Murder Squad books are, in order: Faithful Place (Amazing), the Likeness, Into the Woods, Secret Place, Trespasser, and Cold Harbor (still very good, but my least favorite)."
"Every Dublin Murder Squad book has been fantastic. I adore Moran. Even Conway, despite her paranoia (maybe because of it at times) I liked her. Even when I was afraid she would turn into an untrustworthy narrator. I knew, it was going to end up being as Conway and Moran suspected (as in not so easy as the obvious person being guilty). I don’t know if I was shocked at who and why. I feel like the story leads you right up to that point if you’re paying attention and I tend to be pretty good at making inferences. The author has this way with her stories, they grab you. Every little detail, every thing you think may seem minor - pay attention because she doesn’t provide bits just to take up paper space. All in all an excellent read. "
"This was my first Tana French book, and even though it's book 6 in the series, it was completely satisfying as a stand-alone read. Set in Ireland, the grim life of a murder squad detective is taking its toll on protagonist Antoinette Conway. When she is called to investigate an apparent ""lovers' tiff"" murder with her optimistic partner, Steve Moran, they soon discover all is not as it seems. Possible corruption within the force, an ominous stalker, dead-end leads, and constant harassment from her colleagues cause Antoinette to question everything. This rough and tough character (be warned—she has a mouth on her!) is determined to get to the truth, whatever the consequences. A gritty, compelling story!
"
"If you need a gripping series to take your mind off things, try the Dublin Murder Squad by Tana French. This is the sixth and final book, and I think the best except for #1, In the Woods. Each book is told from the perspective of a different character, most of them detectives in the Murder Squad. The stories and characters interconnect and reappear, but you don't need to read the other books to enjoy any one of them. They are gritty, stylish, well-plotted, and compelling. After a while, they started feeling a bit oppressive, because it's a murder squad, after all. Maybe it wasn't wise to read them consecutively without interspersing other books, but so be it. I will be looking for more books by French."
"4.5. This took me a while to read because I own it, and even though I started it in early March I made the mistake of going to the library and deciding to work on my library pile first, which shoved this to the back burner.
It was a slow start for me. Antoinette is extremely unlikable, and from the get go you're wondering how accurate her descriptions are about the interactions she's having with other people. The mystery/crime here was interesting, although I did not feel myself pulled in too deeply until probably the last 30% of the book. It just felt kind of like an uphill battle, where you knew something big was coming but didn't quite know WHAT, and the when was taking forever. That said, once it got good I was locked in, and was very satisfied by the end."
"Antoinette has achieved an important goal - become a member of the Murder D in Dublin - a group of old boy detectives with big reps. What she did not expect was the underhanded, and sometimes slimey, tactics to get her dumped from the team. Within this minefield, she and her partner are handed a case with all of the trappings of gang connections. They are fearful of being undermined in the office and have to come up with covert strategies to get the work done and keep their findings safe. I enjoy French's great Dublin dialogues ripe with slang and the wonderful cadence of the language. Antoinette is pretty hard-nosed and has quite a potty mouth but you love her. Of course nothing is as it seems as Antoinette and Steve uncover the layers of lies that cover this case."
"This was absolutely Frenchs' best in this series - by far! I disliked In the Woods, liked the next one a bit more and then she grew - and her writing style and POW made her very unique and interesting.

I have to say that the constant negativity and paranoia is beyond tiresome - and yes, of course I do understand that it's tough to work on a place like that - and yes, I would have been just as irritated if the main character was a super negative man - it's just depressing, and means that I could only read for a few hours at a time, and then needed some time off to smell the flowers again.... I normally don't need 8 days to get through a 4* book - soooo....

But - absolutely a great read - really!"
"Per chi fosse interessato, guardatevi la serie TV tratta dai libri, è bella tanto quanto la controparte cartacea.Questo per dire che il libro mi è piaciuto tantissimo, a partire dai due detective, e un po' mi dispiace non ritrovarli negli altri libri se non ""Il Collegio"" che credo sia il prossimo che leggerò della French (anche se ho scoperto che andava letto prima de L'intruso, ma tant'è, lo leggerò come prequel). Una volta iniziato a leggere non puoi più posare il libro per scoprire come va a finire e questo è un grandissimo punto di forza. Solo il finale non mi è piaciuto molto, avrei preferito un finale più aperto, ma probabilmente è una cosa soggettiva.Ah, Breslin è la copia di Dudley Smith di Ellroy. Ovvero un antagonista pazzesco."
"The first book of this series, In the Woods, got me hooked. Subsequent books were good, but not quite as first rate. This last one is spot on! An excellent story, well paced with well developed characters. Det. Antoinette Conway and her partner Det. Stephen Moran are part of the murder squad. They pull a case involving a beautiful dead woman. All evidence points to a new boyfriend. Should be an easy case to solve. But some things don't sit well with Conway. She's getting the feeling that other detectives in her squad are setting her up for a fail, any way to get her out of the boys' club of the squad. The deeper the partners dive into the case, the more disturbing it becomes. A very good mystery indeed!"
"Let's say 3.7 stars. Told from the perspective of the only female detective on the Dublin murder squad, a story about a young woman found dead in her apartment. Our protagonist has a very Benson-Stabler style partnership with her fellow detective, so all the classic themes of a good murder mystery. Lots of leads, twists, turns! Many sections are page turning and riveting, made me jump! Other sections toward the later part of the story seem to lose that pace, but still kept drawing me in over time. The sense of her feeling like an outcast and being disliked by her squad grows tiresome and a bit overdone. Lots of great character development and love all the descriptions of scenes describing interrogations, parks, outdoor conversations in the cold and especially love the old bartender."
"Another amazing DMS book. I’m so sad this series has come to an end. While I definitely had favorite books (1,2,4) I still loved them all, and The Trespasser was no exception.

Antoinette Conway was a really interesting narrator. I didn’t always like her, but I respected her and was along for the ride. I adored Steve since the last book, and I was so glad to get more Conway/Moran action.

Tana French is simply amazing. Her interrogation scenes are works of art. They can be 50 pages long and it doesn’t even feel like it, I’m riveted.

I really liked the inner politics of the department in this one, not knowing which cops to trust, trying to figure out how dirty they were. And I loved that this book ended on a more positive note, when usually they end sadly."
"Alright, this concludes the series for me, and this particular book was a re-read. I think Moran is probably my favorite character and I also really liked Antoinette both in this and The Secret Place, and I find their relationship to be both realistic and fun to read. I thought this was one of the better plots and a more surprising reveal than some of the others, and I liked the shift back to the actual detective work, operations of the police headquarters, shades of gray on top of shades of gray. Just all around good stuff, and I'll now shut up about how excellent Ms. French's writing is. I talked myself out of giving every one of these books 5 stars, but I'd rate the whole experience of reading them all within a couple of weeks as 5 stars."
"Another solid entry from Tana French. Always a consistently good writer. It feels like I'm watching a movie when I read her work. Her world building, scene setting and describing the non-verbal communication or ""unspoken"" words between characters is sublime.

The Trespasser follows a cynical, weary Detective Antoinette Conway in her investigation of a seemingly routine domestic violence case. Her partner, Steve, a likeable good-natured guy, provides the perfect counterpoint to Antoinette's pessimism. Together they discover that this case is anything but routine. But how unorthodox this case becomes takes the reader by surprise.

Overall a satisfying whodunit with strong characters and a decent plot."
"This still didn't have the same ""it factor as In the Woods and The Likeness, but I enjoyed this a lot more than the two prior Murder Squad books. She stayed away from the weird, mystical, unexplainable pieces that she threw into the last two books of the series and kept it straightforward. I like the Antionette Conway character and wish she could've got a win, but maybe that would've been too neat and tidy. I'm glad she realized that the universe didn't revolve around her and that everyone was not out to get her--she had me believing it! Antionette's father popping up for five minutes was a pointless piece of plot, unless she plans on giving her the lead in another book and exploring that relationship. Overall, well done, Tana."
"A love-hate relationship.

After receiving the first novel within the Dublin Murder Squad series “Into the Woods” as a Christmas Gift a year ago I have been chipping away at the rest of the series since. ‘The Trespasser” alone took up 6 months of this time. I couldn’t help putting it down and picking it up again at a later date, not just due to a busy schedule but also due to the lengthy scenes. Don’t get me wrong, “The Trespasser” has a captivating story line, although for me it didn’t have the same “page turning” feel as the first few novels within the Dublin Murder Squad series.
Saying this I still love Tanas rhythm and style so I will most definitely be seeking out any future murder mysteries she may publish whether that be an addition to the series or a stand alone novel."
"""The case has changed. Before, we were dragnetting, sifting through what came up and hoping there was something good in there. Now we're hunting. We've got the prey in our sights and we're closing in, and everything we do is building towards the moment when we'll have him pinned down for the kill shot.
That feeling, it's not some bullshit figure of speech. It lives inside you somewhere deeper and older and more real than anything else except sex, and when it comes rising it takes your whole body for its own. It's a smell of blood raging at the back of your nose, it's your arm muscle throbbing to let go of the bowstring, its drums speeding in your ears and a victory roar building at the bottom of your gut. I let myself love that feeling, one last time. I let myself drink it down, cram every second of it deep into me, lay away my store of it to last the rest of my life."""
"Tana French is an exceptional writer, one of my consistently favorite mystery authors. Her mysteries are dense, wordy, twisty, get down in the trenches, expose the underbelly of society, the dregs, the hidden secrets of the posh, and inner thoughts of the characters. The Trespasser kept me guessing, engaged, and frustrated with the Detective Antoinette's persecution complex at times. At times in her books I get a little weary of the detectives' thinking through so many scenarios for a murder, but I suppose that is the realism of the work of the detective and office politics in play. Especially in this novel, where there are so many false leads. The ending leaves the book open for new characters in future books, if there are more to come. "
"I have an up-and-down reading relationship with Tana French. I have enjoyed some books and been bored by at least one and she does suspend disbelief at times too rigorously. At the beginning of this one, I was finding myself ready to yawn and thought it was going in a direction that would not be interesting. I was wrong, thankfully. A bit further in and I was hooked. The voice is so Irish that I really felt the culture even without a lot of description. And the story has enough twists to keep the flow interesting. But mostly I enjoyed the politics of the police and the machinations each character would go to in order to further his/her ends. Each character was well distinct and interesting. It’s long, but worth the read for anyone who likes police procedurals. "
"“All these stories - they hum, like fist-sized hornets in the corner of the ceiling, circling idly, saving their strength. I want to pull out my gun and blow them away, neatly, one by one, vaporize them into swirls of black grit drifting downwards and gone.”

3.5, rounded up rather than down because ultimately I respect this book more than I love it. Another ACAB banger from Tana, for sure, but the case didn’t engross me as much as her best stories do. It’s a shame, because I think the Conway-Moran team are great, and I loved each and every interrogation sequence. It just dragged in its second half and never had me on my edge of my seat the way past Dublin Murder books have. Still a great series.

As of right now: 4 > 2 > 1 > 6 > 5 > 3"
"A bit conflicted

It took a while to get used to the Irish cop jargon and I never did get used to the conflicted head case that that was the first-person narrator. I kept hoping she would get over herself, but I’m sure that was intentional and it set the mood (even if that mood was a swirl of chaos). However, the plot and the range and depth of characters kept me reading. The ending was not necessarily a surprise, but it did leave me satisfied. And as proof of French’s ability to develop her characters, I was left imagining what became of Rory and Lucy, both secondary characters, but both very real and deep. Throughout most of the book I thought I might give it only 3 stars. However, I finally had to admit that I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next."
"Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran, are the night crew in Murder when on their way out one morning their Chief personally brings them a call in directly to the murder line and not 999. In addition to the unusual circumstances of the call in, a ""babysitter"" given to them by the Chief, and a murder scene with few clues, Conway is working against the old boys club of the Murder Squad room. Pressured to arrest the victims recent boyfriend and hounded by unflattering press Conway doesn't know what witness to believe or who on her team she can trust, including her own partner. Suspenseful and full of internal tension between the characters I enjoyed this addition to the Murder Squad series told from another new perspective.
"
"This was a good one. I was a bit over Antoinette's constant negativity although it was easy to see how she could be paranoid or think everyone's out to get her. French is good at creating these characters that are definitely flawed and dis-likeable, yet likeable all at the same time. I think the only one of her characters that wasn't flawed was Steve (in this and the last book).
Anyway, this was interesting, and I was pretty sure I figured it out very early on, but it was still good to see how it would end up (and no, even when you think you know who, you won't see how it plays out until the last few pages). I won't give more up about this so as to not inadvertently give anything away."
"Set in Dublin. 464 pp. Great ending to this series. Antoinette is a great character... tough as they come, and taking bull from no one, to her own detriment. This felt a little slow going for me for the first 150 pages or so, but then it evened out well. I found I wanted to race through to get to the end, but there was enough new bits of interest along the way that kept me going. Really enjoyed the ending.

The Trespasser (Dublin Murder Squad, #6) by Tana French"
"Inside thoughts & outside voice

This was my first read of Tana French - and yes I understand that it is book 6 in the series). But I understood as well that the order doesn’t really matter as there are new detectives and characters in each installment.

The lead character, Antionette, has so much going on inside her head that it is a central theme in the novel. She is quite sure that anyone, everyone, is quite possibly out to get her, especially her colleagues in the murder squad. The battle between what she is thinking and what eventually comes out of her mouth is constant through the story.

The pace is rather slow in the sense that her second-guessing herself delays much of the dialogue. But in the end, it wraps up well and leaves you thinking all was nice and tidy."
Antoinette Conway and her partner on the Dublin Murder Squad Stephen Moran are assigned to what at first appears to be a simple domestic murder. Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home while preparing a romantic dinner. Assisting Conway and Moran with their investigation is Detective Breslin. Antoinette has also been experiencing harassment in the squad which is making her consider quitting. The book doesn't just go into the case but spends more time exploring the dynamics of the Murder Squad than the previous books in the series that I have read. The book starts a bit slow but the ending is gripping. Another great entry in this series.
"This is the 6th book in Dublin murder squad series by Tana French. Even though it's the 6th book in the series it can be read as a standalone.

This was my first Tana French book so I had no idea what to expect.

The storyline/plot was cleverly thought out. I kept asking myself: whodunit?
I had 2 prime suspects but both guesses were wrong. I was thinking along the wrong lines. (I wouldn't make a good detective).

I enjoyed the book on the whole but felt the chapters were dragged out. Based on this I awarded the book a solid 4 stars.

Would I read more of Tara's work? Absolutely yes.
I will definitely be recommending this book to all crime lovers."
"A good interesting read that kept me gripped once I got into it. Plenty of drama to be had and with a back and forth mindset to who actually did kill Aislinn or was it a simple accident.
Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fact that at times parts of the story dragged on for too long,like we know what it's leading up to so rather than make us wait through 50 odd pages just get to the point a bit sooner.

I have read from the Dublin Murder Squad series before and really enjoyed them so I've encountered Breslin before though not as familiar with the rest of them so interesting to read/see it all from a new angle."
"I loved this book, it was the perfect slightly-dark but not depressing mystery novel with a bit of psychology mixed in but not too much. It was a little slow to read with the Irish slang & dialogue but I liked that, it felt real and added to the sense of place. The one reason why I gave it 4 stars, not 5, is that I felt there were a few too many times where characters told their stories (at the end, rather than the detectives figuring it out bit by bit or even all at once using clues or deduction; it seemed like the easy way to tell the reader what had really gone down. But I did like that we got to know all the details in the end). "
"This is a tough one for me. I liked it, yes, but the more I think about it I'm not exactly sure WHY I liked it. I think, perhaps, as this is the 6th book featuring Antoinette Conway, but the 1st book I read, some of what I perceived as weird additions, like Conway's unexpected visitor, may not have been so weird to a seasoned reader. I like Conway. Yes, she has a chip on her shoulder, but I also think if played right, this book could be a real turning point for her. I enjoyed the parallel between Aislinn's story and Conway's story; it added some depth to the book. Will I read another of these books? No. Probably not. But I did enjoy the ride on this one. "
"i did not like or trust this narrator, in the best way

antoinette conway is a straight cold bitch, no chaser

she believes the entire dublin murder squad is out to get her; major paranoia in everything she does

and her voice is so strong, i didn't know whether to believe her or not

i felt like i was at her mercy throughout this book because her personality is so strong

french gives the reader an image of detectives that i haven't seen in other crime novels

detectives as actors, as manipulators, or maybe that's just how conway sees them because she thinks everyone is always lying to her

i will find out by reading all of the other books"
"I felt that Tana French had hit a bit of lull in the last book, even with the introduction of Antoinette Conway, a feisty and complicated character that showed some promise. With Conway coming to the forefront for this novel I was excited to see where she was going to take us. This time the development of the crime, the action, and side players were better and more interesting. I'm hoping for the next book to be about Breslin since there's appears to be a lot of potential for a really broken protagonist. Overall, this book was solid and enjoyable. If I could give it a solid 3.5 stars I would."
"When young woman winds up murdered, detectives Conway and Moran are assigned the case. The are the newest detectives in the Murder Squad. Conway has been around in other departments, but she is resented and disliked by her fellow officers.

They pair are also assigned a ""senior"" squad member to watch over their progress. He is urging them to wrap up the case quickly and assures them that her new boyfriend is the killer. Conway and Moran have other ideas which puts them in to trouble with their senior handler.

I loved the chemistry between the two detectives and I hope Ms French uses them again."
"Wow! I love Tana French for her prose, her storylines and most of all her characters. Antoinette Conway is simultaneously sympathetic and unsympathetic: she's absolutely committed to getting the bad guys, yet her personal feelings about the job and about herself threaten to sabotage her case and her career. I love the Dublin slang, and French's description of the weather. Excellent plot, some surprises, some not-too-surprises. Finally, what I love about the Dublin Murder Squad series is that you can start with any book. Each references the ones before it, but each can also stand on its own, without a need for a lot of backstory. Highly recommended."
"I have never read Tana French, but will definitely look for more of her books.
I LOVE Antoinette, the main protagonist/detective. A combo of Lizbeth Salader and Kay Scarpetta, with her own uniqueness stirred in. This is an Irish location, complete with the jargon that is so interesting, and similar to some of England's best stories. ( I love the word ""gobsmacked""....so descriptive!)
The early 1/2 of the book is best, investigating the death of a young woman, while Antoinette tAkes charge of the case and is still badgered and haunted by her paranoia of being the only woman on the murder team. Great characters and full bodied novel."
"I really enjoyed this, mainly for the voice of the narrator. A good storyline, really interesting characters and lots of twists and turns which were still making me question what was going on even up until the very end. I'll look forward to reading more of French's work - as it turns out this part of a series which I will have to invest in! That being said it makes a great standalone story and I didn't at any point feel like I was missing something in the backstory. The only reason I haven't given this the full five stars is that I didn't feel overly excited to read on - though it's not something I found easy to put down either."
"The precision of handling a criminal murder investigation the way Ms. French does is remarkable. She takes us from the moment a call comes into the station to the way the incident is finally solved and all the minute issues in between, which could potentially be very boring, and makes us want to turn every page quickly to see what will happen next. The wear and tear on the investigators; the need to track down the slightest detail or possible witness; the amazing ability to carry out a multitude of stories that intertwine and contradict makes this a fascinating read. Highly recommended to those who enjoy police procedurals."
"While on my October marathon of spooky books, I've been reading a lot of stories that are okay, but leave me frustrated in the end. I picked this book up because it was cold and I ducked into a bookstore to warm up and it was there. I've loved this series since I picked up the first book overseas (I wish I remembered who I'd lent it to). Reading through was just pure enjoyment. A good mystery with rich characters and some great character growth. Conway and Moran are a fantastic team and I'm glad that we got a second novel focused on them. Anyway. It was just nice reading something new that was pure enjoyment start to finish."
"The main reason I read this book is because Emily May (a reviewer I've come across with almost every book) gave it 5 stars. She typically hates every book I like so I was curious as to what kind of books she likes. :) The Trespasser is a very detailed murder mystery. I listened to the audio version which is awesome because of the narrator's Irish accent. However, I have to admit that I skipped a few chapters in the middle because while the details were great, the plot needed to move a little faster. I loved French's character development and the twists throughout. It's a story that will stick with me for a long time to come."
"Tana French is a wonderful storyteller. She gives just enough description to put you in the scene and lets the dialogue carry the narrative. The plot moves along quickly with sophisticated twists and turns and takes the reader along for the ride, even when the plot is complicated.
This book follows Antoinette Conway and her partner, Steve Moran as they investigate the murder of Aislinn, a young girl killed in her own home. It appears to be a simple case with a new boyfriend to be the likely killer. But every detail comes together to point them in different directions.
Can’t wait for the next one!"
"Fiction – murder mystery. Set in Dublin, this is another great read from Tana French. When the case comes in to the detective squad, it is assigned to Det. Antoinette Conway and her parter, Stephan Moran. Conway is the only woman in the detective squad and she has, by necessity, built a very hard shell. Moran is younger and newer to the squad and somewhat pitied by the other detectives because he has been assigned to work with Conway. The case seems extremely straightforward at first, but Conway is not known for taking shortcuts or jumping to conclusions. This was terrific and the narration by Hilda Fay was wonderful."
"While this was not my favorite of her books, I did really enjoy reading this investigation following detectives Antoinette and Steve from the Murder Squad. They are trying to determine how a beautiful young woman died, and they aren't convinced the first suspect is the right fit. Instead, they find how her case connects to an old one, and they prove they aren't afraid to look at a cop as a suspect.
I think Antoinette's stubbornness and self-doubt and willingness to play the victim made her less lovable than your average flawed detective, but she overcomes...at least a little.
I look forward to another installment, but I can't figure out who might be the star detective."
"Still love Tana French. This book did have 2 characters from the previous book but this time Antoinette Conway was the main character and her partner Stephen Moran whom we saw in her last book as the main character, took a back seat. Again, this is a murder mystery/police procedural, but Tana French really gets you into the heads and lives of her characters. Great character and plot development as well as pacing of the book, I didn't feel like it dragged much - maybe a little toward the end that could've been edited down. If you liked her other books, I think you will enjoy The Trespasser."
"3.75

Uff...è stata dura ragazzi.
Non ho scelto il momento migliore per leggere questo libro, decisamente.
Come in tutti i libri della French, non è tanto la risoluzione del caso a tenere banco quanto le vicende dei detective coinvolti, per questo sarebbe stato utile leggere il volume precedente che introduce Antoinette (perchè le CE pubblicano a caso, perchè?) E ci riporta alla Squadra Omicidi. È comunque un libro che alla fine ti conquista (nonostante l'inizio forse troppo lento) perché sgretola tutte le tue convinzioni e ti ritrovi a non voler lasciar andare via i protagonisti.
Merita una seconda lettura."
"It’s always a little exciting picking up a book by an author who is completely new to you. I found a worn copy in a used bookshop, and the book itself is entirely appealing. A pliable paperback with soft, sturdy pages, it’s a great thing just to hold in your hands. Who would have sold this beauty? The story itself details a female Irish police murder detective who has to try to solve a case despite an unaccommodating male-dominated station. The language and occasional phonetic spelling will have you reading along in an Irish accent, which really works. I’m still only a quarter way through this one, but Jay-sus it’s good."
"I'm on a ""whodoneit"" streak. Strange. Tara French writes mysteries that really are a mystery. In tis one she has a pair of detectives chasing every possible clue (the book is about 75 pages to much). A woman is murdered, she had a dinner date at her home, she is waiting for him.....so obviously, he is the murderer. Not so fast, first we have to listen to the woman DT whine about how badly she is treated by the squad (this could have eliminated the 75 pages); then we have the partners being ""aquward' with each other; then every male the victim knew comes under suspicion. Finally, the murderer is revealed, a real surprise. Happy reading!!!"
"To simply call this book a crime thriller, is a disservice to the nuances French masterfully weaves in all of her work. The Trespasser is a who dunnit with a gender/ class/ race aware bent. The reader walks away with answers, and a compelling juxtaposition of what it means to be a woman today.

The last half of this novel kicked off, and I couldn’t put it down all night. It leaves you asking what would you do if you were the protagonist. And could you really trust anyone in a world that was out to get you? I enjoyed reading a crime novel that dealt with insidious sexism and gaslighting in an all too male dominant genre. French is truly at her best with a female lead!"
"Her plotting and writing just keep getting better. All of the characters seem strong and vivid, and there were plenty of twists. I've now caught up on all the Murder Squad books.

Ranked by quality (first four are a tie):
The Trespasser (good characters and plot, interesting squad politics)
The Secret Place (a dive into the mind of teen girls, good mystery, good characters)
The Likeness (suspenseful, I bought into the preposterous gimmick totally)
In the Woods (good characters, good mystery, good squad politics, a bit tangled here and there)

Broken Harbor (kept me guessing but characters a bit flat)
Faithful Place (too easy to guess the killer, didn't care for characters)
"
"Read as an audiobook performed by Hilda Fay, just over 20 hours. I'd call this a police procedural, but most of the procedure was a relatively new and strong willed, female police detective in a ""man's world"" thinking out loud. It is a long novel, perhaps overly so. And, there's not a lot of exciting scenes. In spite of these, which may be detractors, the story draws you in and it was interesting to me to see how the murder was solved. The narrator has a heavy Irish accent and there were many local phrases which may make the audiobook hard to follow, if not in good listening conditions and paying attention. Even so, a high 3 rounded up to 4."
"Not sure how I feel about this being the last in the series (at least thus far) - it still feels like there's so much character development for previous detectives that could be explored, so I'm hoping Ms. French will return to this world she created. It was interesting dealing with a potential cover-up and cops being 'on the take', and I almost wish that had been true, as it was more exciting and engaging than what actually wound up being the case. There didn't seem to be the same moral dilemma as has been faced in the past, and I think it left the overall mystery wanting. Still an enjoyable read, just not my favorite in the series."
"Satisfying mystery with several good twists. Murder squad member Antoinette Conway is assigned to a murder that reminds her of something. A young woman is dead in her home, seeming to be a domestic murder of a young woman hosting a private dinner for a boyfriend. After interviewing the woman’s close friend, Conway’s partner Moran wonders if she had a secret boyfriend, one in a gang. This sets up some intrigue when a detective from the gang squad takes a particular interest in the case. I was satisfied by the ultimate twist, but I thought the beginning was a bit internal and belabored. Still love the characters "
"Until I started to read this book I had forgotten that had already done so, but I decided to read it again and am glad I did. I have read and enjoyed many of Tana French's novels and love the characters she created and her writing style in describing the unusual and engrossing stories she tells. This one had several characters who it was hard to love but who I was still interested in following. The murder case The Dublin squad handled was one that I found disturbing in what it said about cops that is not too far off from what we have been seeing in the news today. It makes you wonder who, if anyone, are the 'good guys/gals?'"
"It took me awhile to get with Conway, her paranoia made her off putting which reinforced how she was alienating herself from the squad. I’ve read 3 other Dublin murder squad books and the dynamics in this one were fascinating because the protagonist was so distrusting of her coworkers. The crime had an element of the victim gaining vengeance on the perpetrator, but in a poignant Pyrrhic victory way since she had met someone and had plans for her future beyond the revenge she had sought on the detective who decided she and her mother shouldn’t be told what became of her disappeared father. Highly recommended "
"How is it that I'm completely surprised every time Tana French looks like she's wrapping things up with 1/3 of the book still to go and then a giant wrench comes crashing down and changes everything? EVERY SINGLE TIME. This was no exception. When evidence was found that seemed to point all the fingers at one person, I was sure things were in the bag. And then another wrench came crashing down. And then that one maybe went away? Or maybe the first one did? Or maybe a third showed up? Or maybe the next thing wasn't a wrench but a hammer? All I know is that I couldn't put the book down for the last 100 pages. "
"This is my second Tana French book, having read ""The Witch Elm"" earlier. Yes, I know that I should read the Dublin Murder Squad books in order but I can only do read what the library has available at any one time and her books are almost aways ""on hold"", so it's a matter of grabbing what I can.

What I like about French is how well she writes in a number of ways: lots of background about the characters (so you really get an emotional connection to them), her ability to write good male characters is much appreciated, and the emotional flow that she can maintain for hundreds of pages is awesome.

I'll keep scanning the availability of her titles, and eventually I'll get through them!"
"Reads like a British police procedural

Airline Murray is dead. D's Moran and Conway are given the case. D Breslin is there to ""supervise"". They start chasing red herrings and Breslin pushes that the new boyfriend is guilty as proverbial sin, but they sense something isn't right.
A side plot runs along the main one, and I found it tedious and distracting. Conway thinks that, as the only woman, the entire squad is out to get her. The author devoted entire chapters to this theme. I didn't see the point until the end , but still think it distracted me from the main plot. I wanted to quit reading."
"I am behind in reading Tanya French, this one was my first. I'm big on characterization, her toughness, paranoia, and insecurities made her a believable modern character for me. The book was a dense read, requiring a commitment through the 'maybe' theories, jumping the gun, and simplistic initial witness/suspect interviews. Still French has a gift with the human psyche. On an emotional level the last 50 pages were well worth the length. I can well picture most of these characters in a tough intimate Dublin backdrop. I'm in now for more of her work, and can easily see this book moving to the big screen. "
"I really like Tana French and I love the Dublin Murder Squad series. I would say some of her books, especially this one, are too long. Some scenes like the interrogations run on and on. A few times I fell asleep listening and I am not sure I missed much. I am glad I stuck with this one, though. Stephen Moran is one of my favorite characters from the series. He is an upstanding guy and knows how to morph himself into who he needs to be depending on the situation. Even though Antoinette Conway is extremely prickly, she is interesting and sharp. They work well together. This is the most recent book in the series and it came out in 2016. It may be the last one, but I hope it is not."
"third tana french book! (which reminds me, i need to backdate the first book i read...)
as always, i love her writing style; the slang, the similes, the flow of it. my favorite part about her writing is the narrator never is, and never claims to be, objective. thus far this has been most explicit with Mick Scorcher in Broken Harbor, but maybe that sticks out to me the most because i disagreed with his philosophy. either way, it's refreshing to read something where the narrator makes plain 'this is my opinion, and if you don't like it, tough.' pacing on this was a little drawn out i think, but i can't complain too much as i love her work regardless!"
"For anybody but Tana French this would be a home run. Memorable characters. Ruined by their circumstances into truly desperate actions. But it is missing some of the truly elegant features of earlier books in the series. For one thing, it largely repeats the protagonists from the previous book. For another, the murder and its causes is not integrated in any serious way into the early life history of the investigating detectives. And, most disappointing, it is missing about two surprising plot twists from the typical TFrench style - so that even a relatively lazy reader like me could predict the murderer with great certainty about 25% of the way through."
"Tana French is one of my favorite mystery writers and although I didn't like The Trespasser as much as some of her other books, I still thought it was a good read. I went back and forth on the plotting of this story - I normally like a slow burn because I feel the pay off is well earned, but this one dragged some in spots and there were some plot elements and motivations that I didn't get on board with 100%. These are are not big quibbles though - I just have high expectations for French. A solid 4 stars."
"So this is not the best Tana French book but it's well done - it's not all that mysterious which is key to why it isn't as good as the others but it's very well written. It really seems to more of a character study and a bit of an sight into the various folks we have met before in her other works.
It is not a page turner but it's good and worth reading
I do not think you have to read the others first before reading this - it doesn't seem to relate that much nor do you need other information to get the gist of it

"
"This is a solid literary murder/detective mystery set in Ireland that kept me hooked. The novel features a spicy female protagonist who is angry at the world and trying to make her mark in the male-dominated homicide squad. There are lots of interrogation room antics, deciphering of clues and piecing together hypothetical storylines, and psychological profiling. I felt that the end dragged on a bit, trying too hard to fill in all the holes of the mystery, but overall it was a good thriller that was hard to put down."
"I'll be reading these as long as Tana French keeps writing them. This particular one is not as strong as others. I found the murder itself to not be as interesting. Much is made of the detective, Antoinette, being an outsider due to the color of her skin. I thought that was very interesting, but the point is hammered a little too much. She is extremely paranoid, and it affects her work on the case. In addition, the book is a little long. That said, I am always glad to visit the Dublin Murder Squad. "
"Though this book was a bit long for my usual liking, I really enjoying this book. It wasnt necessarily jump out of your seat scary or suspenseful, but it was a well written, well illustrated, solid mystery novel. I enjoy her writting style, as well as the fact that she includes Irish slang in the novel, which ads for some humor. Though it was more of a steady read, it really held my attention. The characters were well developed, and the scenes were drawn out. It actually gives you a realistic idea of how the ""Murder Squad"" is run. Will definitely be reading more from this author!!"
Listened to this one. Narrator Hilda Fay did a nice job. I picked this up because I saw a good review online. I didn't realize until I was halfway through that I'd read Tana French before of that this was the 6th in the series. I seriously disliked Into the Woods. That ending - jeez. This one I liked. And I think reading it as a stand-alone book was fine. There was never a point where I felt lost with the characters or their backgrounds. I would read another one if Antoinette was one of the main characters again. 
"This is a solid Tana French read if you enjoy her books. Still not my favorite - that's The Likeness - but as only the second book of hers with a female protagonist, I enjoyed it because of the unique aspects of being a woman in a male-dominated field. The mystery aspect of the book was okay - there were a few twists and turns, but overall not too difficult to figure out which way it was going. Then again, I seldom read these books for the mystery itself and instead appreciate the more complex character stories. Worth a read."
"I think that what I like best about Tana French's novels is that they transport me back to Dublin and I can actually picture where the characters are. Beside that, I really liked the way she developed Antoinette Conway's character in that I was annoyed by her at the beginning, but like the mystery unfolds you learn more about why she behaves as she does. French's novels are never just about the mystery; you watch characters find out more about themselves as well and I think it takes skill to make those two aspects correlate as well as she does. (still like Faithful Place the best, though!)"
"Wanted to put a plug in for the audio version. I listened to about 1/3 of the book before I had to return my copy. I eventually purchased the book and reread start to finish. I usually enjoy reading a novel much more than listening to one, but this novel was an exception. While I enjoyed reading the novel for many of the reasons listed by other reviewers, I missed Hilda Fay's voice. She really brought added spark, hardly necessary with French's writing, to the description of setting and characters."
"The two things I like best about this book were the growth of the MC, and that we got to see the flip side of the detective duo Conway & Moran. I really liked how Conway's growth came because of a sudden (shocking to her) epiphany, because sometimes that's the way life is. My favorite minor characters were the Gaffer and Flea. As usual, it is really interesting seeing the parallels and contracts between the MC and the murder victim.

I'm looking forward to the next one in the series and I am curious who will be in it."
"Tana French makes my heart sing. I love everything about her novels. I really could not stand Conway in the The Secret Place, but realized she was A LOT like myself in The Trespasser. That's one of the things I appreciate about French's writing. She takes a character you probably didn't like before, and turns him/her into something you can relate too. Or at least understand. With that said, it wasn't my favorite French work. I had a bit of a hard time with Aislinn's level of cunning and her ability at the long con. But, that's okay, it's fiction right? "
"Another really good one from a rock-solid author. This one was like a room full of funhouse mirrors. It had me second-guessing everything.

I also really like Antoinette as a character because she is who she is. She's so abrasive and has such a giant chip (more like a boulder) on her shoulder that, to me, there's not even a whiff of the author worrying about readers liking her. That makes her feel very real. Plus, her character progression is excellent in this book.

I kept trying to figure out who will be the main character in her next book. My guess is one of the floaters."
"The first time I read this book I almost couldn't stand it. The narrator drove me just crazy.

But.

Then I found I was referring people to this book as a near-perfect capture of one aspect of the experience of a woman working in a men's field.

Which doesn't make this a comfortable book to read, by any means. On re-read I liked it a great deal more, but it isn't comfortable by any stretch.

But then, I've never much gotten the impression that Tana French writes to provide comfort to the masses. This book is definitely no exception to that trend."
"This book--fortunately--departed from the Tana French formula in that a few human beings experienced actual connection for brief periods of time. Her strengths were on display: a vivid setting, lots of plot, good pacing. I still think her prose is a bit overwrought, and her books are oddly formulaic for supposed genre-busters; if you alter the mystery formula in exactly the same way every time, it becomes its own new formula! Nevertheless, this was more on the level of In The Woods than were the other books in the series."
"One again, Tana French hits one out of the park.

Every one of her Murder Squad novels has a lead detective character with serious issues, and Antoinette Conway is no exception. One odd fact is that with only rare exceptions, characters from earlier novels do not recur even with cameos. How big is that homicide department anyway?

Here's a free for nothin' tip for Ms. French: bring all the past lead characters with all their baggage together in a blockbuster Murder Squad dysfunction party!"
"I loved the voice that French used as she told the story of a pair of detectives on the case of a young dead woman. It was told from the very quirky POV of detective Antoinette Conway. There were parts which were redundant—theories that existed in the detective’s head finally make it to words with other characters, for example—but basically it was an absorbing story. Did I manage to figure it out? Yes, but not till near the end. Another thing I liked about the story was the abundance of Irish slang that was incorporated, really making Conway seem like a person. "
"Tana French always delivers and she’s done it again. This is a great crime drama with outstanding characters and super dialogue. The plot twists and turns just as I would expect in a solid French crime novel, and she delivers a great plot twist in the final quarter that I knew was coming but couldn’t quite figure out. My only criticism is that I do think the book is longer than it needed to be. It could probably have lost 100 or more pages and have been leaner and a little pacier - but it was still pretty unputdownable for the last third."
This was one of my picks when I first joined the Book of the Month Club. It’s taken me a while to get to but I’m glad I did. It’s been a long time since I read a book that I just couldn’t wait to get back to. I love that it is set in Dublin. I love the humor in just the right places and not too much of it. I love that even though this is part of a Crime Fiction series it could stand on its own. I did get a little tired of how the theories went back and forth but it kept me from truly figuring out who did it.
"Of the Dublin Murder Squad books I've read so far, this one took me the longest to get into. Conway is such a difficult character to embrace, with a giant chip on her shoulder, incredibly angry, bitter toward the entire world. (All these things may be merited or not.) The thing is that if you're able to hang in there at the beginning, you'll be rewarded by Conway's evolution throughout the course of the story. Not an easy or pleasant read, but ultimately one of the more satisfying books of the series."
"Most excellent stuff. The only other book I’ve read in this series is The Secret Place. Also very very good. But this outstrips it. French is a master at using the first person narrator to pull the wool over the reader’s eyes. We are completely enmeshed in Conway’s paranoia and bristliness, that we can’t see it, or the case, for what it is until she does. The tension is sustained until the very last couple of pages - will the killer get away with it after all?! (And this from someone who skipped ahead and knew who done it from very early on - it spoilt nothing.)"
When I first started this book someone asked me if it was good and I was like yeah it’s great. But then I started reading and I was wondering if I told the truth but the more I read the more I liked it and I was relieved that yeah I told the truth the characters where flawed but like able the story line believable and honestly I loved the way they talked near the ran I was like man I wish this would never end or I wish this was part of a series that’s how much I liked this book and I was pleasantly surprised that yeah this is part of a series.
"I liked this. It was good. There was a time though in the middle of the book where it was hard to like the main character very much. She seemed to kind of wallow in her position that she was not liked by her team. I understand that may have been the case, but it kind of threw the focus off of the main storyline and became somewhat distracting. Maybe that is what the author intended. The last part of the book that tied everything together was good though. I found myself quite engaged in the story and the ending was excellent. Overall, it was a good book. "
"This book was so incredibly written, it pains me to only give it 4 stars but... in traditional Tana French style, the crime is mildly interesting and drawn out AF so when you finally find out whodunnit goddam, you just don’t care. Read this not for a mystery, read it for its ability to absorb you so deeply into the inner workings of a police station, the police politics and for corrupt policeman. It’s so so good for all those reasons. But cause I’m a serial killer, gore and horror, total plot twist lover.. I had to take off that one star. "
"I am hooked on Tana French! This is the second of her novels I have read. Her writing sings and pulls me though the unfolding events as fast as I can swipe the pages. I appreciated the psychological wisdom of the six options when you catch a cop breaking the rules, the sixth being feeding a journalist the information. I was only a little disappointed in ""The Trespasser"" for two reasons, one that it lacked the expressive depth and heft of ""In the Woods,"" and two, I was pretty sure I knew whodunnit from early on and I was right. Of course there was a certain self-satisfaction from this, nevertheless, I think I should not have been so confident and right about it."
"this one had my favorite protagonist and favorite partnership, but my least favorite plot, so really this is a 3.5-star review. it felt like the beginning and middle dragged, and then everything sped up around the halfway mark; it was almost as frustrating to read it as it was for the detectives to work the case, which was a really nice effect--once the climax started building, i could hardly put it down. conway and moran kept me engaged throughout, and hopefully they'll get referenced later in the series so that we get updates on them."
"I think the thing I loved most about The Trespasser is that Antoinette is the kind of take-no-prisoners badass woman that I love reading about in fiction. French is simply superb at building up characters, and her interrogation scenes are extraordinary. The twists in this book gave me whiplash and I would love to see The Trespasser turned into a miniseries—there’s enough material here to really sink your teeth into.

I still maintain that The Secret Place (previous entry in the series) is a real stinker, but I’m so glad I got around to reading this and now I cannot wait for The Witch Elm. A very strong 4.5/5. Tana French and I are back on track!"
"This is part of the Kenton County Summer book club. I really like Tana French. I’m writing this a few weeks after I read it, so I don’t remember the names. I know that beside the police procedural, French addresses themes of identity and how identity is formed. What stuck with me was the idea that the main character assumed how her squad perceived her, rather than how they actually were perceiving her. It became a self-fulfilling situation. I feel like French builds up some tension to solve the crime, but she never tricks the reader. "
"This book was much more of a psychological read than I was expecting, and not very action-packed; the ""action"" mostly took place in police interview rooms and conversations. That turned out not to be a bad thing. While it was a bit long, it kept me guessing and was really suspenseful. I loved the two main detectives, especially the unapologetic and potty-mouthed Antoinette. I enjoyed the way the author played with the idea of storytelling--how each character had a different version, or different reality, of what happened. "
"I like this author, and I like her stories about the ""Dublin Murder Squad"". Lots of inner dialogues, sometimes it's even a little tiring, but it doesn't ruin the ensemble, and for me it's exactly the aspect that distinguishes the author from others in the same genre. It's not the first time this pair of detectives work together, and this isn't a sequel. It's interesting to see how difficult it is to follow the investigation and to think that there's a solid path only to find out that you were played. Nice. "
"I really enjoyed this one! At first, the murder mystery seemed mundane and the initial questioning of the persons of interest just sounded tedious. It seemed like there was too much dialogue and nothing was happening. But the dialogue was key! The plot revealed itself thru the dialogue and the characters were fully fleshed out thru the dialogue. I’m very impressed with this author.

I also liked the MC a lot. She was tough, smart and confident. She was all about solving this case.

Some of the male voices the reader did were iffy but overall, she did a great job with the audio."
"This one hit close to home, having lived through intense office politics and ostracism myself. The way it twists your head and what think of yourself, your confidence, competence, instincts, and perception wracked into a tangled ball and thrown out the window. The sense of belonging and self identification that can stem from professional accomplishment, and the emptiness left behind when you think you’ve lost that. French really captures the complexities of the human psyche in this one, in addition to pulling off an addictive read. Didn’t want to put it down. "
"This is my first Tana French novel. She is very talented and can present a clear narrative taking the reader seamlessly into the the worod sge has created. This book was detailed and very entertaining. Most mysteries I have the twists figured out rapidly. I did not with this book. Tana French weaves such an incredible web, I felt caught up in everything and nothing all at once, if that makes any sense. My only complaint is that I like my endings neatly closed. This book gives you some of that but not fully."
"Nothing innovative in terms of murder mystery but lots of depth into characters' psychology. If you love dialog THERE IS PLENTY of it this book!! The Dubliner colloquialisms are funny and cops are just as fouled mouth as the ones in the US. Detective Antoinette Conway faces lots of misogyny and sexism from her department as she tries to figure out a gruesome, sad murder. I enjoyed the descriptive details of modern detective work, using modern day tech (CCTV footage, breaking into email and phone etc). "
"After playing a small part in the last book, Antoinette Conway takes centre stage in The Trespasser. She has made the murder squad, and brought a new, young partner with her, but all is not well. It's a murder mystery, and how the murder was committed keeps you guessing throughout, but it is also Conway's journey, through dizzying twists and turns, longing to find her place, and her people. I love Tana French's use of language, the dialogue I can 'hear' with an Irish accent, and her flawed, raw, messy, and loveable characters."
"My favorite thing about this final installment of the Dublin Murder Squad was how French's writing took me on the same paranoia roller coaster ride as her protagonist. Throughout, I couldn't decide if the squad was out to get her or if it was all in her head and I rolled with every new case theory. This one lacked the element of magic that has weaved through previous novels... I suppose you could argue that it was based on the powerful force that is love or the perception of it, but I missed that element of the mystical that made you think ""what if?"""
"Vaya, no me di cuenta de ponerlo en ""Libros que estoy leyendo"", muy mal, muy mal.
En fin, es el segundo libro que leo de esta chica y no será el último. Había leido ""El secreto del bosque"" y me parecía que este no iba a estar ala altura, porque es el más reciente (Aquel era uno de los primeros) y bueno, suele ocurrir que a medida que avanza el tiempo, se pierde un poco de chispa, pero no: otra novela de investigación, polis buenos, polis malos... en suma, entretenimiento a raudales. No necesito más, por ahora."
"It is rare to read a novel with almost no flashbacks. The resulting narrative is impressively propulsive and begs to be read as quickly as possible. I think this book covers maybe a week(?), but it reads almost as a tick-tock of the days and nights of one member of the Murder Squad. A really interesting experiment. Conway is an easy protagonist to respect and a tough one to like (for good reasons), but I appreciate how French gives her enough moments of metacognition to allow for growth. It's a very good book, much like the other DMS books."
"This was an excellent book to end this series with. I was very happy with the writing, characters, and flow throughout the whole story. I was grateful she didn’t go back to perspective changes like in the previous book, that didn’t work for me. French does such a great job of giving you all the information you need to know about surrounding characters based solely off of her descriptive observations from Conway. I feel truly satisfied when reading her books and like I’m really put into the shoes of her main characters. I’m sad this series is over, but I’m excited to read her other books! "
"I love a twisty plot with fleshed-out characters, and this one hits the mark. I enjoyed the relationship between detectives Conway and Moran, and appreciated that the author created a strong male-female team without mucking it up with a romance. I listened to the audio version of the book and couldn't get enough of narrator Hilda Fay. Her Irish, no-nonsence voice really added to the characters. I'm currently listening to another Tana French book with a mediocre narrator, and it's just not as much fun."
"Very good, but my least favorite of the series. Two young detectives on the murder squad, Antoinette Conway & Stephen Moran investigate the death of pretty blonde woman found dead in her living room. The woman's name is Aislinn Murray and Antoinette thinks she recognizes her from somewhere but can't remember where at first.

There are a quite a few twists and turns, including pressure to arrest Aislinn's new boyfriend Rory. Antoinette is convinced that most of the murder squad are trying to push her off the squad.

The book was longer than it should have been and had too much dialogue."
"I must admit, I was expecting more from this book, especially after Broken Harbor. But it was a solid book, touching on important issues to ponder: crime and discrimination in the police world. The bother was that I could not connect with any of the characters the way I did with others, like Cassie Maddox or Rob Ryan. I could feel their inner torment and feel emphatic. Here...it's like the characters push you away just as you feel like getting closer to them. Still, a solid crime novel, worth reading."
"Antoinette is a fatherless child who grows up to be the only female detective on the Irish murder squad.  She's so tough, she takes on a job where she has no one to trust but herself.  Harassed and despised by her squad-mates, she becomes paranoid to even her partner's actions and underlying motivations.  Revenge is the game here.  But revenge has teeth on both ends!

Tana French's books are VERY wordy and long.  You know ""who dun it"" well before the end of the book, but the dialogue and the characters are very compelling.  

Excellent narration by Hilda Fay with her lilting Irish accent"
"Antoinette and Moran are paired together to solve what initially appears to be a simple murder of a young woman. In addition to the crime, Antoinette is also dealing with a squad that makes her feel like she is not wanted and doesn't belong. As she and her partner start following the clues, it appears that there's more to the story although they feel like they are being pushed to a tidy ending. I did have a little trouble with some of of the Irish vernacular but it was a good story with a couple of twists."
One of the joys of Tana French mysteries is that even though the Murder Squad is all set in the department the characters are all most always new and different each time. It took me awhile to connect with Conway as she struggled with a chip on her shoulder but her gradual self inventory helped humanize her. As is always the case there are plenty of twists and turns as you try and sort out the murder. Some of the Dublin Murder Squad books are better than others - this one was good and worth the read.
"This was the first Tana French I've read; I had a student who was a devout believer, who was curious, and was also interested to see what I might learn, writing-wise, from reading something in this genre. I was kind of surprised that the actual plot wasn't that surprising to me, I mean how things ended, nor that there were too many twists and turns, exactly. The voice was strong, though, and the best thing about the book, for me, were the relationships between the characters, and how sympathies ebbed and waned along the way."
"I read this just after finishing The Searcher because it reminded me how much I'd enjoyed Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books and realized I hadn't read this one, perhaps because #4 and #5 only got three stars from me.

I guessed who murdered the victim half way through and the detectives would have figured it out too but they didn't want to see it. I still wanted to know why and also how they would figure it out and what they would do about it.

I thought they ""why"" of the victim getting involved with the killer was a bit of a stretch. I guess it's possible though."
"I was much more impressed with this one then some of the previous books. The plot was a bit meandering. French has a bit of an issue with that, but overall this plot was much more intriguing and felt like it was you know, sane. Which was nice, I was starting to miss nice, sane plots cause the last few French books have been utterly ridiculous.

I'd still say French is a pretty hit or miss author for me. I'm probably going to stop buying the books and instead check them out from the library. Because I'm more likely to hate the book then enjoy it."
"This was the first Tana French book i've read. I watched ""Dublin Murders"" on t.v. and really liked it, so thought i'd give it a try.
I thought at times it was tedious and slow, but on the whole, really enjoyed it. Seemed very realistic in terms of police procedure, how interviews work, and the trust between partners.
As a mystery, i also enjoyed it, you're never really sure until the very end, as there is always doubt. You feel for the victims as much as the ones who are guilty.
The author does not sugar coat things, and i really liked that."
"The 6th and final Dublin Murder Squad book, this one is narrated by Detective Antoinette Conway from the previous book (The Secret Place, #5). She and her partner Steve Moran (also from #5) try to solve a murder that has inter-squad implications.

Another twisted tale as Conway has to deal with a squad room she feels is all against her and a prime suspect who her partner feels is innocent. Lots of disturbing sub-plots and personal back-stories that lead to a dramatic ending.

I've really enjoyed this series."
"It’s funny, but I abandoned Tana French’s first book in this series and was hesitant to pick another. So glad I took a chance and read this one. It was an enjoyable read and kept me interested. If French meant to have a surprise at the end, she did not succeed. This did not distract from the story at all. I think I’ll go backward with the series and read #5 next. I liked reading about Antoinette and Steve trying to figure out how to trust one another and how to work together. It would be interesting to see how this partnership started. "
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well-written with interesting and well-developed characters. The police procedural aspect was believable and the presentation of the squad as sexist was realistic. The initial build up of the ""mystery"" was a little slow at times in the first half, but an enjoyable ride through twists , turns and backtracks in the second. My only criticism is of the amount of colloquial expressions and slang. This wouldn't be an issue probably to those more familiar with Irish/English speech, but was confusing to this poor rural American."
"oh yes i enjoyed this so much. antoinette and steve were giving major cassie and rob <3. this felt to familiar and yet so distinct from all her other novels. i love that tana french can write a six book series with repeated themes + stakes but with such different stories + characters. i liked the ending a lot, which definitely boosted it up rating-wise, as i thought it would end in classic tana fashion, however, i was impressed. so sad to be finished with the dublin murder squad series but icl, i will absolutely be rereading these. "
"Anche in questo caso, grande ritmo, tensione e una storia intrigante. La protagonista anche in questo caso però dev'essere durissima, al limite dell'eccesso per dimostrare di stare dentro al tessuto. Altra cosa che mi ha convinto poco sono i tempi: tutto si svolge in talmente poco tempo che mi sembra tutto molto poco realistico. In generale però trovo che sia tutto davvero molto realistico in termini di gestione del lavoro, di formalità da gestire, di tecniche per interrogare. Bello, solo un po' troppo caratterizzato in termini di maschio alfa tutti. "
"the story within the story within .... I liked the way she used bold text to differentiate thoughts from conversation among characters; although towards the end she reverses that. The way she creates the female characters is of great interest as the british language argot.

it is a somewhat detailed psychological thriller where there were some strange twists of plot for example how the detective's story somewhat paralleled the victim's.. even the title held a double entendre since it was indicative of the harms we do other's with our made up stories."
"as the last book in this series, this book made me so nervous. like i was so on edge, and i thought i was able to predict everything, but i truly was one step behind the author the entire time. Tana French's writing style is sometimes hard to get through, like it took me longer to read this than an average book of this length. but it's jut because i have to think about it more, which is good. overall this was the perfect mixture of challenging and entertaining and i would recommend reading this whole series!"
Ahhh the last of the Dublin Murder Squad. I enjoyed this book. I've pretty much enjoyed all in this series except for The Secret Place (book 5). The only frustration with this series as a whole is I wanted more stories with the detectives I fell in love with from book 1-Rob and Cassie. Every story is weaved together with a character or two from the previous books. Tana French's dialogue makes me feel like I'm in Ireland. Interesting plot lines and characters. Overall I would recommend this series to anyone who is fan of crime stories. 
"Good mystery, interesting characters, but OMG too long!! I got so tired of the detectives discussing who they should talk to next - the friend, the neighbor, the lover, the BFF, the other detectives. Instead they had to have loooong discussions about who, when, and how to carry out these interviews, instead of just going out and talking to these people. This mystery could have been written just as suspenseful in half the pages! Also, I was not a big fan of the Dublin slang. Most of the time I could figure it out, but in all honesty, I didn't want to work that hard. Still gave it 4 stars."
"I Found It Suspenseful

Suspenseful, and at the same time I was thinking--get to it, my god--I can't wait until we get through this section of gobshite onto the crescendo (their word, not mine...gob...).
Since it made me feel something: 4 stars; but it could have gone either way. I could have been frustrated hurrying to the end. You see what I'm saying? It's a thin line between un-put-down-able, and dragging toward a pretty formulaic ending in a whodunit. You know it's one of a few; let's move it along."
"Another great read by Ms French. On the whole I have loved her books. There have been a couple I wasn't keen on, but most, and most of the Dublins Murder Squad stuff especially, is well worth the read.
Again, she does characters very well. This time some 
dirty cops and the not so easy to get on with , the little ins and outs of the group, how the work, misunderstandings etc.

I for one would love more of them. Sadly I've come to the end of her current work, and have to wait patiently for hopefully - more.

"
"I’m inclined to rate this a 4 rather than a 5 mostly because the Secret Place was my absolute favorite of this series and is so hard to match. The Trespasser was still a fantastic end to Dublin Murder Squad saga, and Antoinette and Steve’s friendship continues to play to French’s strengths by showcasing two characters flawed in incredibly human and real ways. Antoinette’s insecurities get the best of her friendship with Steve many times, in ways that I think many readers might recognize themselves in. The ending was a really beautiful wrap up to the series."
"The Dublin Murder Squad now features the story of Antoinette Conway. Abrasive and who doesn’t like playing by the rules, Antoinette is paired up with Steve and they are given a throwaway deadly lovers tiff to solve and close. Quickly the start to realize that there’s way more to this story and the rot may be closer to home than previously thought.

Another good Irish detective story!

"I love a good mystery, an dthis installment of the Dublin Murder Squad delivers that. In Antoinette conway, we have a complex character/member of the Murder Squad. In Aislynn Murray, we have a victim who in many ways is not a sympathetic character, but there is ample reason why not. And in the murderer, well, to avoid spoilers I won't say much. The secondary characters--other squad members, the victim's friends, and family members of other characters--are mostly believable and certainly interesting in their own right. Altogether worth the time to read. "
"3 1/2 Stars I chose this as my book club selection because I have a friend who thinks Tana French is fabulous and was curious to see if I agreed. The Trespasser is a well-done police procedural but, at times, felt plodding and overwritten. The characters are well-drawn and I liked the the way the plot unfolded into a 'no one saw this coming' resolution. Unlike some, I had no problem with the ""bitchiness"" of the main character. Was she unpleasant most of the time? Yes. Was is justified? Also yes. "
"For the sixth book in a series, I thought that this one was pretty good. It was not my favorite, but better than the fourth book in this series, in my opinion. I didn't guess who it was right off the bat, but the person that they were pointing at during most of the book was way too obvious, so I knew it couldn't be him and then when it got to who it really was, then it wasn't a shocking twist. That's the main reason that I'm giving this book only 4 starts compared to some of the others. I like twists that I can't guess at. I would still recommend this book and this series."
"Tana French does not disappoint. Detectives Conway and Moran are back, but in this case they have a young woman who appears to have been murdered by her boyfriend. As they dig more into the case, the boyfriend angle unravels and they face some serious moral and professional questions. As always, French doesn't just write a good page-turner, but her writing is evocative and emotional. Finally, you have to love the Irish slang from ""shite"" (shit), ""gaffer"" (boss) and more."
"Another excellent book by Tana French. This was another look into the lives of detectives on the Dublin Murder Squad. I got to learn a lot of Irish slang, as well as the fact that Irish cops are misogynistic a-holes--or at least they are in this book. I am glad that Conway finally started to loosen up the chip on her shoulder, and realize that all she needs to do is her job well. Looking forward to the next one."
"Gripping murder mystery, if you like that sort of thing. Written with lots of slang & tough cop dialogue, which I found a bit tiresome, but seemed authentic (what do I know about such things). The main character, Antoinette, was flawed, overly defensive, paranoid, and bitchy, however this too seemed authentic. I liked how the characters developed over time, to see flaws in themselves, to see their own weaknesses. "
"This book has an exceptional portrayal about how your judgment can be affected when you think everyone is out to get you. You see things that are not there and you miss things that are - or you don't see them clearly. The whole picture can change when you change the frame you put on it.

Some parts of the set up dragged a little but you need it all by the end.

French is now on my list to read her other books."
"Tana French explores emotional cruelty in its many forms in this novel which made it an uncomfortable challenging read. It is also challenging to read about characters who are not easily likeable and who are jumping at shadows in their own lives. Bullying, gender issues, paranoia, depression, domestic violence, trust are all realistically and ultimately, tragically explored.Definitely a good read."
"I love Tana French's non-stop suspense detective books set in Ireland. That being said, fair warning to the reader because these are gritty and crass, often contain violent crime scene depictions and a lot of excellent Irish swearing. I liked this one because the main character is a woman who finds herself ""in deep"" in both her case she is working and within her ""all male"" department. And also because French is a master with dialog, with and character association."
"Everytime I pick up a Tana French novel I know I'm in for an entertaining read. I love the way she writes, and even if I've figured out the mystery before finishing the book, it's still a great ride. I wish I knew more authors who write such finely crafted, literary mystery like this: I've read all of Kate Adkinson and JK Rowling's Cormac series--- even Stephen King's crime fiction series is similar to the French smartly written style. I will wait eagerly for book number seven. "
"I've now read three books in a row with heroines who are acerbic, prickly, and may not always make the right decisions immediately and I am here for it. I love reading about less-than-perfect women who tend to speak maybe too quickly. French's mysteries are a favorite of mine, both for her writing and the way she slowly spins out what is happening. The audio of this is also A+-highly recommend it if you're thinking about reading it."
"I've determined that I am not always thrilled by thrillers, but Tana French really knows what she is doing. I've read a couple of the Dublin Murder Squad series and one thing I can count on is her ability to catch razor sharp dialogue and develop plot lines that keep my attention. I found the interview and interrogation scenes in this book to be particularly masterful. I intend to work my way through the series.

"
"I definitely enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down. The writing is great and the storyline even better. I found myself yelling at Conway through most of the book. She's too much in her head and thinks everything is about her. If only she could step back a bit things might've come quicker. Curious to see what the other Dublin Murder Squad books are about.

I read this via audiobook."
"Another winner from Tana French and her Dublin Murder Squad. Aislinn Murray is found dead in her flat with her head smashed in, and it's up to the Dublin detectives to determine if the murder was committed by her new boyfriend, or the mystery man she was supposedly seeing. Aislinn's story becomes a little far-fetched, but French does her usually stellar job depicting Detective Antoinette Conway trying to solve the murder while facing discrimination from the male members of the squad."
I love Tana French but did not like her main character in this one very much. She was too much of a victim of self doubt and paranoia of sabotage by men in her squad to the point that it took away from the story. I do like that Tana French develops her characters so deeply with whatever faults they have and this was a good enough page turner that I still recommend this one. My favorite of hers were the first 2 books though Into the Woods & The Likeness. 
"Such an enormous fan of French; to me, this is her absolute best to date. She recaptured the tension from In the Woods, which is precisely what kept me coming back for more in her Murder Squad series. Loved Conway and Moran together; really appreciated learning Conway's story. This one kept me guessing until the final 50 pages or so, and the ending was perfect. Now that I'm caught up on the series, I feel the withdrawals beginning. Hoping she continues on for many years!"
"I have some mixed feelings about The Trespasser, as there were so many times that I was engaged, intrigued and impressed by the mystery. However, there was something about the characters that was unappealing, and I started to get annoyed when they all kept saying ""Fair enough"" over and over! But on the whole, I wanted to keep with the story (which was wonderful on audio) and find out who did it, and why!"
"Set in modern Dublin, this crime thriller is smart and compulsively readable in that the reader is pulled into the lead detectives' speculations --the tossing around and weeding out of various probabilities and the eventual honing in on something quite unexpected. The growth in insight on the part of the main protagonist is well executed, as is the snappy dialogue, Irish idioms to boot. A good read."
"The best since The Likeness, even if In The Woods is the one that has stuck with me the most. I don't tend to remember much about the characters from book to book but these two are the first that have made me want to go back and reread the last one, just to spend more time with them.

But I swear to god if she doesn't full circle these and solve the case from the first one in her last I'm gonna do a murder and then the murder D's will have to come investigate me."
"This is my first Tana French book, and I'm starting to see what all the fuss is about! The story was intricate and kept me guessing until the end -- every time I thought I had things worked out, there was an angle I hadn't seen before.

I gave this 4, not 5, stars mostly because it took me forever to get into it. But at about 1/3 of the way in, I couldn't put it down.

Now, I need to go back and read more of her books!"
"There were some decent twists in this murder mystery. I listened to this on audiobook and thoroughly enjoyed the Irish slang being read in a proper Irish accent, I don't know if I would have imagined it properly if I'd have read it on paper. I had a pretty good idea who the perp. was going to turn out to be about half way through. All in all, I found it entertaining and was interested in seeing how the ending played out. "
"I really like the Tana French - Dublin murder squad series, although I think this was one of the weaker ones. Love the way that she gets into people's heads. The plot felt a little weak but she manages to keep your interest from beginning to end. Although you have a good idea as to who is guilty, it really doesn't matter that much. What holds your interest is the relationships between the detectives and the other characters. The dialogue is brilliant."
"I don’t know where Tana French lives, but it must be a dark and twisty place. However, it fuels her imagination to write some really good books, so I hope she does not move any time in the near future. Her Dublin Murder Squad series has long been a favorite with my wife and myself. This book is the among the best of the lot and a very, very satisfying read. It kept me guessing right to the end. Highly recommended!"
"I like Tana French's books. They string you along and then end with a bang. It's a surprise to discover who the killer is. This book is no exception. The books are all set in Dublin Ireland. Ms French carries characters from one book to the next, but not always the same characters. In this book the main characters are Antoinette Conway, a detective with a chip on her shoulder, and her partner Steve Moran, a calm, quiet guy. Their case seems like a slam dunk, but isn't. A great read."
"I read this book independent of the series. It was good; not edge of me seat good but good enough that I had to finish it.

I know some people, like me a lot of the time while reading books, just can't stand the suspense and have to know what happens before it is revealed in the book. For those of you like me, here you go- 
McCann was Ashlyn's boyfriend, he killed her. Breslan helped to steer the detectives away from McCann."
"Another winner from Tana French! In this one, Detective Antoinette Conway has to battle her own personal paranoia and paradigms in order to get to the bottom of a murder. Is everyone out to sabotage her and her case, or does it really have nothing to do with her? Not my personal favorite, but that's not saying much - it's another sterling example of French's astonishing ability to tie excellent character studies to suspenseful murder stories."
"Tana French does it again: she creates characters I care about, and it's the consequences of the crime to the investigating officers that matters most to me while I'm reading her novels. This was again a well-crafted tale, and I couldn't bear to put it down until I'd finished. She keeps the pressure on to the last two pages. Well done! It only misses being a 5 for me because it's not the genre that gets 5s from me, but I almost think I should change my scale for these books. "
"I’m a solid Tana French Fan; love her writing, love the twists and turns of her plots, and her characterizations of the murder detectives in Dublin; but this was not my favorite of the bunch. There was no gut-wrenching a-ha moment for me, and I did not like the vast majority of the characters, including the protagonist, Antoinette. Even the victim was interchangeably sympathetic and not. My favorites are still The Likeness and The Secret Place."
"Not my favorite French work.

Last bit is the best. Good but not French’s best. I ended up enjoying the progression of the protagonist’s character, but found it very slow. There was a lot of time wasted on rehashing the perceived hostility of the protagonist’s work environment. The premise requires a fair amount of willful suspension of disbelief to swallow. I have found French’s precious works much more engrossing. The ending does pay off, however."
"Kolejna książka z serii o dublińskim wydziale zabójstw nie zawodzi. Tym razem historię opowiada Antoinette Conway, którą poznaliśmy w ""Wiem, kto zabił"". Partneruje jej wieczny optymista Stephen Moran, a sprawa dotyczy pozornie prostej, śmiertelnej kłótni kochanków. W toku będzie zarówno o tym, jak kształtują nas rodzice, czy warto walczyć ze wszystkimi na wszystkich frontach w imię ideii i do jakiego stopnia nasz egoizm filtruje nam rzeczywistość."
"If you are a fan of the Dublin Murder Squad series, then I highly recommend this edition. French attempts to tackle issues of race and identity in this issue, and while I admire that, it falls a little flat. I was thankful to have a female detective again, and we revisit the issues women face working in a highly patriarchal environment. The murder scenario itself will keep you guessing with deftly hidden red herrings. As always, French has crafted a mystery to devour in a matter of days. "
"I can’t remember the last time i read such a long novel so quickly. It felt great. For several books, now, I’ve been on the verge of quitting Tana French. She has redeemed herself with Trespasser. It’s my third favorite, right behind the first two. Really great characters (the leads are fleshed our much more than in their previous appearance(s)), and the story packs quite a punch well past the “solve.” I’m ready for a follow up!"
"Irish Detective Antoinette Conway is a complex character, shunned by many of her colleagues and suspicious of the rest. When a seemingly simple domestic leading to death is assigned to her, she recognizes the victim from her past and realizes all is not as it seems. An exciting and well written story with well developed characterization. In Conway, Tana French has created an engaging protagonist and a compelling police mystery."
"Definitely going to be reading every book in this series that comes out- I'm hooked! Even when I guess the guilty party or the ending ahead of time, there's something so engaging and immersive about the writing that you need to see it acted out, all the twists and turns in between and you really care about getting to the finish with the characters. (Also love how former side characters recur as main characters. Steve is my fave)"
"I have read several of this authors books, and this one did not disappoint. A great story with lots of intrigue. I loved the 2 main characters and the slang terminology. However, am not a prude and despite having grown up in an Irish Catholic family where even saying “shut up” sent you to you bedroom for half an hour, but I found the coarseness and swearing to be a bit much. The points could still have been made with a little less of that. "
"It was really good. The reader feels as uncomfortable and unsettled as the main character throughout the majority of the book. It was as if neither of us (the main character and me) could get a grasp as to what the story was about. This was clearly the intent of the author, and it was well executed. I did not like feeling so out of sorts, but I liked that the author was able to make me feel out of sorts. If that makes sense... It was frustratingly good. "
"I have always enjoyed Tana French's novels and while I did like this one, it wasn't my favorite. I had a difficult time with the protagonist as he chip on her shoulder was very difficult to get by at points. I also agree with other reviewers who thought the book dragged at times and leads often seemed to be pulled from thin air. But that aside, French is a great writer and while I may not always like her characters, they are well developed and she does draw you in the story being told."
"If this book was 250-300 pages, it would be perfect. Some of the details get a little distracting. Antoinette, in the role of the unlikeable female protagonist is, well, unlikeable. I also feel like maybe some of the major conflict with her remains a little muddy, and could have been more concise. None of this is enough to keep me from reading, because French has set up such an enjoyable little world here with the Murder Squad."
"This was a well-written book, taking place in Ireland, written with the Irish accent. The plot was interesting, although it dragged a bit in the beginning as the detectives were beginning their investigation. It picked back up in the end and I was surprised at whodunit! Great story, strong characters. I would definitely consider reading another Tana French. I'd never read one of her books before, and it was easy to get into the story without knowing any background from previous books."
"The book starts off a bit slow and to me, a bit sloppy, but really picks up the pace as the story unfolds. I found myself second guessing myself as I tried to figure out what happened. This is a 3.75 in my mind, the thing that held it back for me was the regional dialect. I just had a hard time comprehending some of the Irish dialog. Other than that, the latter half of the book is completely gripping. "
This book was such a refreshing take on the murder mystery genre. The whole time I was trying to figure out what actually happened and going back and forth on who I thought did it. I also loved the theme of perspectives throughout the book. Several characters got wrapped up in the stories they were creating around certain events that they were missing reality. I have loved this author and this series. I'm a bit sad to be done with it. I'm hoping another one will come along soon.
"Whew. Intensive reading experience. A book that is hard to put down or not dream about. The tension in the novel is not about whodunit; it is tense, constantly, because of the inner life of Detective Antoinette Conway. She is intense. She is always watching, thinking, evaluating her life and her relationships to the squad. This transfers to how she thinks about victims, suspects and family. A very well written murder mystery."
This another great read by Tana French. You know from the start that something is off in the murder investigation. There are quite a few possibilities for why it’s not routine. It’s the last quarter of the book when things finally start to sort out but the leads and misleads along the way make for a satisfying solve. I’m still pondering on Antoinette’s meeting with her Da. Did it add something? Was it a necessary side trip? Highly recommend this one for sure!
"Tana French just knows how to tell a good murder story and this is no exception. What I particularly liked about this 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series was this specific narrative voice (woman of color) and the way in which the overarching story is about the stories we tell ourselves and the stories we tell others. Controlling one’s own narrative or controlling another’s narrative is, ultimately, about power. "
"Another great Tana French mystery. Incredibly dark but leaving you on the edge of your seat after almost every page. French does a great job of unrolling the story, keeping you incredibly tied in to the details, and making you wait for the inevitable surprise at the end. Antoinette Conway is alternately frustrating in her abrasiveness while sympathetic in her isolation. A strong read by a talented author."
"I loved Antoinette Conway - for a while I kept thinking the title secretly referred to her, since she felt like a trespasser among her own squad. I also loved how this examined the paranoia Conway feels in her profession - she starts second-guessing people and wondering if she can trust them because she’s been treated so badly, not just as a woman but because of the colour of her skin. I sorta wish Tana French would write more female detectives."
"Another case involving the Dublin Murder Squad. This is probably my least favourite in the series but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat. It would also be nice thread a paragraph without any swearing in it, I understand that some people use a lot of bad language but this really was too much for me to be comfortable. Fair plays to the author, I would never have guessed that it was a revenge plot. Tana French is always worth a read."
"Although I sometimes feel her stories sagging under too much description, one of the things I really enjoy about French's novels are the endings. Some of them are genuine surprises, or have elements that are unexpected. In this novel, even once the murderer is known there are still developments to the very end. I enjoyed one of the final scenes with the captain. She paints her characters well, not just the main players, and you can get invested in their decisions. "
"I cannot recall the last time I was quite so engrossed by what is, essentially, little more than a story about how police detectives conduct their business. And it all seems to ring so true with all the tensions of a team of individuals who work together remarkably well, or remarkably badly, contingent on partnership relations. Plus, it also shows the horribly easy way in which an innocent player can become the targeted perpetrator, whether through malice or ignorance. Well worth my consideration of another Tana French novel should a spot open up in my queue."
"The first quarter of the book, I did not like the writing or the protagonist. The protagonist of the book was bitching about the hard time she is having at the workplace and in her life. The story was not moving forward as I expected. But after that, the story got interesting and there was a lot of twist and turnings.

I liked the story. It was good. A definitely a go-to book if you are a fan of murder thriller."
"Really liked this book. Not only do you follow the story of the victim, but also the lives of the detectives....how they complement or rub up against each other. There is a grittiness and humanity to her novels that compels me to stay up all night to finish. From the start she hooks you, plays out her line and lets you (and her detectives) run, and they slowly reels you in to what for me has usually been, an ending that I hadn't even suspected."
"A happier ending than a lot of the other murder squad books, in which the protagonist implodes at the end. I like them all, but it’s not great to see the protagonist you’ve come to enjoy knowing fall to bits at the end in some way or other! As always, I enjoyed her dialogue a lot. I liked watching Antionette and Moran solve the murder as Antoinette realizes sometimes we all live in a story of our own making and don’t see how people really are."
"Tana French is able to get in the head of a female murder detective to solve a murder and, at the same time, to experience the slights and downright discrimination that a woman in that job would deal with. I appreciate the perspective, as well as the vicarious ride through the twists and turns of a murder investigation. The audio recording is a great companion when I'm sewing - and even better when I'm driving. A good diversion."
"I read The Trespasser directly after finishing another one of Tana French's books, The Witch Elm. This book is not as beautifully written as the latter, but the story is catchy and who doesn't love a strong and quirky female lead character? I enjoyed it, but found the book unnecessarily long. After reading two of Ms French's books, I'm not really sure who she is as an author, but I like her well enough to want to read more books. "
"Although this book started slowly, I enjoyed the setting in Ireland, and the interminable dark and cold, and as the book progressed, I became increasingly interested in the characters. One of the most interesting was the murder victim, Ainslinn, and her recent connection to a man who owned a bookshop and was a suspect. I wanted to hear more about this couple, and felt truly sad that they didn't have a chance for their romance to bloom and develop."
"Another solid entry. A fairly prosaic mystery, but like her best books, the writing keeps you dead centered in the narrators head. Conway is probably the prickliest protagonist in a while, but for good reason, and some of the deliberate deflations (hard to talk around without spoilers) hit hard. An interesting change focusing much more on the internal politics of the squad room that benefits from being backgrounded for the previous books."
"Tana always has a good mystery. And a great writing style. She just gets me. I enjoyed the plot, I just really disliked a lot of the characters in this one. Especially at the beginning. The previous book was narrated by Moran, whom I very much enjoyed. The detective narrating this book is her partner, and had a bee in her bonnet for most of the book. Until the end, I really didn’t enjoy her character. The plot worked out perfect (just like always Tana!), and I really enjoyed this read. "
"Maybe my favorite book from Tana French yet. I heard in an interview that her goal when writing the murder squad series was to pinpoint the case that transformed and changed the detectives lives forever. I think this novel does an excellent job of changing every single detectives lives involved and the payoff, the final scene is worth reading a few times over. So glad I persevered through the annoying whining parts of The Secret Place to make it to here. "
"3.5 ⭐️ VERY slow to start with and at 469 pages it was quite a struggle but 1/3 of the way into the novel it picked up pace and got really interesting and I found it difficult to put down. One thing I really didn’t like was the police referring to each other as spas all the time as having had a brother with cerebral palsy I found this offensive, however I don’t know if it has the same connotations in Ireland as it does it the UK."
"Th final or the latest of the Dublin Murder Squad, was a bit of a step away from what Ms French books usually deliver. Whereas Conway and Moran are my least favorite of her characters, the plot of The Trespasser was a solid old school police procedural without a lot of the side plots and character development and hint of unexplained as in her other books. It was a good read but didn’t deliver the gut punches that all of her other books have."
"A really good vindication of the 'Dublin Murder Squad is really about SUBJECTIVITY' thesis. Antoinette, my fav surly WOC protag!!! I enjoyed this novel all the way up to 
'no one except maybe two people were really bullying Antoinette, the idea that all the other cops were being racist and conspiring against her was just... one horrid bully'. Uhm no that's not how racism or bystanders work. I did enjoy her fantasising about being a private security officer though."
"When I need a page turner with a strong first person narrator, warts and all, I hope I remember Tana French. A murder set in present day Dublin, this story has enough twists and turns to keep one guessing to the last page. The Ds, Antoinette and Steve, go down several rabbit holes and the reader goes right along with them. The reader comes to know, though, that the Ds really are at least a step ahead."
"This is the second book by French that I've read. I enjoy them for the intricacies that twist and turn around the plot. That said, the Detectives' interviews of Aislinn's boyfriend, Rory, were painful to read. So much so that I had to set the book aside for a couple days and make a conscious decision to pick it back up and continue reading. Are real detectives that conniving and bullying, or just the ones in novels?"
"I should have known that this book would get better if I just threw myself into it for hours at a time. That said, I still think it takes a VERY long time to get going. It's a good 150 pages before the first hint of anything besides just procedural gets going. And the intensity on that doesn't crank up for probably another 150 pages. I still anxiously turned pages the whole time, but it was just more of a slow burn that I like in my Tana French. "
"I really enjoyed Antoinette and Steve's partnership this book and the mystery of Aislinn's life and death, but the resolution to the murder fell flat for me at the end, which was more than a little disappointing to me considering this is the last Murder Squad book. Previous books in the series really gripped me and shook me to the core when I turned the last page, but this one did nothing of the sort."
"Just when you think you've got it, there's a twist. A young beautiful woman is found dead. The murder squad thinks they have a suspect. But the two detectives handling the case aren't sure. They want to explore some theorys. And it seems like they are hamsters on a wheel. Turning but not getting anywhere. Antoinette is a troubled character. She has baggage. Makes it all the more intriguing watching her think through a murder investigation."
"Excellent detective novel. I listened to the audio version and for at least the first quarter, the heavy Irish accent was both charming and distracting. The distraction element dissipated with familiarity but I can't wait to listen to another for the accent alone. Aside from that, a solid detective story with twists I hadn't quite envisioned with just enough psychological elements to make it fascinating."
"I almost didn't give this 4 stars because how slow it was and because of what an awful, hateful character Conway was. I came close to abandoning the book simply because Conway was so difficult to stomach, with her persecution complex and her sneering attitude towards anyone who was soft. But the story built slowly to such an excellent crescendo and finish that it close to made up for Conway being so awful. It gets the 4 stars in the end."
"Tana French is always good, but the main character, a woman, is something of a caricature: emotionless, tough, bitchy, hated by all the men she works with. And the interrogation scenes go on and on, as they likely do in real-life police stations, yet it's clear the stage-setting for questions and such could easily be dispensed with. This is the first novel of hers I've read where one is best advised to skim some sections; usually, she's great on characters and scenic detail. "
"Detective Conway works a case for a vic whose life has notable parallel's to her own. Female rage is the emotional core while misogyny is the central social issue. (The flavors are workplace harassment, controlling BFs, and a particularly insidious patronizing brand.)

My biggest gripe with French is that she gets too caught up in her protagonists' heads- it's easy to feel like you're never going to get out-and that plays out here. Conway can be charming and observant, but she's constantly seething, so readers beware. This isn't a light read."
"Tana French is nothing if not consistent. The plot of this one is good, it’s twisted and gets you turned about just as the MC gets buried in the case. But you don’t read Tana French for the plots- you read Tana French for the characters. Hers are brilliant- flawed in realistic, modern, believable ways. They carry the doubts and weights of every person’s every day lives, and through this, French connects the reader to her characters in a way few authors can manage. "
Antoinette Conroy thought that working on the murder squad would be the ultimate job but only her partner treated her kindly. The rest of the squad made her life a living hell. Conroy and her partner were just given A slam shut case and assigned a senior officer to assist. This case is very confusing since this young boy seems guilty to everyone but the two young detectives. How can they find the truth. 
"It was a very slow build up, not terrible but not incredibly engrossing. Absolutely picked up and the last third was devoured in one day. The end was relatively satisfying and the build up felt like it paid off. It did feel long though. I can describe this plot in a couple minutes yet the details and twists were added each way. Not sure how much I liked it to be honest. Good reading for the weekend I had."
"Tana French is a very good mystery writer, if this novel is any indication. It's the first book of hers I've read, but it won't be the last. Altho at times she seems to over-analyze the characters and the plot (there are several different theories as to the crime committed, or even if it was a crime). Overall I found the book very different, and will look forward to reading other books in the series.
"
"Tana French is a favorite and I really liked how this one ended. Broken Harbor was a little too much for me, and then I found The Witch Elm slightly boring so I wasn’t sure what to expect with The Trespasser and I ended up really enjoying it, especially the way we got to know the main character, Antoinette. My all time favorite of French’s is The Likeness, followed by Faithful Place, overall she’s pretty amazing! "
"In some ways, The Trespasser was difficult to read because I saw myself in Det. Antoinette Conway. I could see how strong and independent she is, but also a little self-sabotaging. This is the first Tana French book where I was rooting more for the lead detective on a personal level than for them to just solve the case. I was also impressed with the way she crafted the case and how the killer turned out to be. In the end, I found The Trespasser to be a great book all around."
"“My ma used to tell me stories about my da.”

My second Tana French book and first of the Dublin Murder Series—I’m not reading them in any order—I engaged right away with this procedural mystery, complete with a misogynistic murder squad and hints of corruption. I like Antoinette’s tenacity and ever her paranoia about her place in the squad, and I like that she, too, has something to solve about herself.
"
"French is an amazing writer. Even before I felt invested in the story (it took a bit for me), I was compelled to continue to listen, and thought about the book when I wasn't. The characters were real, with Conway particularly believable, the mystery was intriguing, and the ending was completely satisfying. It wasn't perfect for me, as I was slow to connect with the plot, but it is still a solid win. I can't recommend French enough."
"Started a little slow, but had me staying up late to read more by the end. First one I’ve read with Conway as the character, so I’m curious to see how earlier books treat her character. Book does a good job of keeping you off balance, and feeling Conway’s push and pull about who to trust. Satisfying ending/reveal, good balance of giving you what you want without it being too clean. Aislinn’s behavior that leads to the murder feels very unlikely and a touch contrived, but that’s fine."
"I continue to think that French's Dublin Murder Squad series is the best series of its kind around. What the kind is is difficult to describe. Part murder mystery, part police procedural, part deep dive into character, this really transcends the murder/police genres. Docked one point because it could have used a bit of editing to reduce the length; midway through the book, the narrative seems to bog down a bit. "
"Another slow burner I wanna say? Or at least that's how I'm gonna explain that it took me so long to finish this book. Because I loved the story and its characters and even told friends about how much I like the mystery? And yet the first half of the book hardly kept gripping onto the pages.

Anyways, as I said I loved the case and even more so the dynamic between the two lead detectives. And I also liked how everything was resolved in the end, it kept me quite nervous for a while."
"A fitting ending to the Dublin Murder Squad series. Well-drawn characters and great plot with many different ways for the murder to have occurred. The red herrings were considered and not as tangential as originally thought. The plots of the books in this series are really great. No Scooby-Doo here, thank you. French is a great writer and plotter. I've finished the series over this past calendar year. I've really enjoyed them. Highly recommend."
"Interesting plot with a compelling mystery surrounding the death of Aislinn Murray. Detective Antoinette Conway is wrapped up in her own head, and as readers, it’s easy to get wrapped up in her stuff with her.

I love and hate that The Trespasser reminded me of the Margaret Atwood quote, “Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.” But I loved that Aislinn got that last true laugh, despite its terrible cost."
"Tana French is the reason I started reading mysteries. After reading a dozen or so other mysteries of different quality and subgenre, I remember why I started on this binge in the first place. She writes solid crime fiction with interesting characters that challenge themselves. Things don't just happen to the characters in her books; they make (good and bad) decisions that have clear consequences. The journey to solve the crime is as compelling as the mystery of the crime."
"A police procedural with a strong narratorial voice. Much of the conflict came from within the protagonist, Antoinette Conway, and through her relationship with her partner and the Murder Squad. The revelation of the killer did not come as a great surprise, but the dialogues during the interviews drove the story forward at a great pace. I will definitely look for others in this series or by this author. "
"This is a thoroughly engaging murder mystery.

It leaves an unfinished taste in my mouth, and suffers from some very long passages of dialogue.

But it convincingly explores some challenges of being a female detective, reflects on some difficulties in marriage and passion, touches on ego and strength, and shares some rough interpersonal and internal battles of the protagonist.

The Irish slang is a joy, and it was very hard to put down."
"Undoubtedly the most paranoid of all the Dublin murder squad books, this one involving a seemingly open and shit case of a date gone horribly wrong. French is, as always, strong in command of character and themes, and excels at pulling off a a truly murky setting, where few can be trusted, but she also manages to tie the murder mystery into a much larger theme involving Conway the main detective. Maybe not the series best book but still pretty dope."
"I really like Tana French. She writes intelligent and interesting stories, and this book is no exception. It did lose a star for me, though, because the story is a bit of a slog. I get that real detectives do not have fast-paced, sexy jobs like you see on tv, but this story goes the other way, and at times the plot grinds to a slow crawl. But, having said that, it was cleverly written, and kept me interested to the end. "
"I jumped into the middle of this series but that was not a hinderance reading this book - the female detective is dead-on spunky, pissed-off-paranoid and one of the most honest characters I've met in a long while. Her ability to be vulnerable only to the reader and her never failing acid tongue keep me routing for her and racing forward through the pages. Tana French is masterful when it comes to the interrogation scenes and the dialogue. She slays it every time!!"
As usual Tana French doesn’t disappoint. She is an unbelievable story teller and even though she leads you to the end of the road - and you know what is coming - you still gasp because it’s genius how she tells the story! I wish there were more to this series. I’m a huge fan of series’ but this one given from different point of views and can be stand alone novels. Tana French is a “touch and go” read because of the exquisite language just take your time and the next story will be revealed. 
really enjoyed this - my second Tana French but first of the Dublin Murder Squad series. will definitely go back and read others now. great characters esp Antoinette.she reminded me of the girl with the dragon tattoo! tough on outside but that vulnerability deep inside. and the whodunnit aspect kept me guessing plus interesting take on what it's like inside a murder unit. lots to love here and keep your attention.
"This was a really good way to end this series. I wasn't sure how it was going to end, but was surprised and pleased with the way it was wrapped up. There were some parts that I found annoying, with the main character acting like, because she is a women everyone was out to get her was getting really really old and I was kind of hoping towards the end that they were. That being said it was a great read with lots of crazy twists and turns."
"I read this based on a suggestion by Kendra Adachi (the Lazy Genius podcast). I am a pretty avid mystery reader, UT this one was slow to really get me hooked. But, I did get hooked by the last 1/4th and ended up staying up well after my bedtime! The arch of the main characters development was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely check out more of this authors work- especially if there is an audio version with a reader who has an Irish accent!"
"I really liked this fictional murder mystery told from the perspective of the primary character and female detective Antoinette Conway and based in Dublin Ireland. The book's characters come to life and are complex, hilarious and very likeable. This book is as much about the detective if not more than the actual murder she's trying to solve. Conway's hilarious dynamic with her police partner Steve Moran is very entertaining. Lots of intertwining little mysteries and surprises in the book."
"Fascinating detective story

I enjoyed the dynamics of the two detectives, one bitchy, angry and paranoid, the other calm and reasonable. Although working from a false premise, determined to take control of the case though it felt someone was putting obstacles in their way, they managed to find the truth.
It took a bit of getting used to the jargon since the story does not take place in America, but it was interesting learning different words for familiar things."
"This book was a little more challenging to read as it focused on a much more unlikeable main character, who went through stages of being genuinely annoying. But the story maintained excellent pace and the main character progressed through a much stronger and satisfying redemptive arc overall. Once again, the whole book and particular its ending reminded me just how good Tana French is as an author."
"This is a good one. A suitor is blamed for killing his date. An inexperienced but dogged pair of detectives are given the assignment. One of the team is female and treated badly by the detective squad. She wants to quit but she's in the middle of this assignment and it's going badly. The suspect isn't who they thought it was. It's someone who can hurt them. That they guess. But, who? And, how do they risk proving it?"
"Десь дуже напружувала увага до теми ""жінка за чоловічою роботою"". Але це виявилось прийомчиком, щоб підкреслити стан, коли думаєш, що весь світ проти тебе, а насправді то проблеми з самооцінкою.Подобається, як тут розкручено прості і збиті до банальності речі про дружбу, силу характеру, гордощі-дурощі, довіру. І подобається, як розроблено кістяк кожного з персонажів. Кожен виявляється не тим, ким ти його вважав."
"i really enjoyed this installment in the series. i liked conway's character and the struggle she faced in the murder squad and her realization that maybe she had misread everyone's opinion of her. as always, the author manages to add a lot of nuance and depth to the main characters' relationships.
the mystery will keep you guessing and it feels like there are a satisfying number of twists.
all in all, one of my favorite of the series."
"Though nothing touches the first DMS books for me, this was an excellent mystery. I was hoping for a bit of the uncanny almost supernatural touches, and we never quite get there, but it is excellent nonetheless. I did not see how this one was going to unfold, and there was some great character growth (maybe in a way that actually did not break the main character? Something new and different from the French books I've read previously). "
"I've enjoyed each of the books in French's Dublin Murder Squad series as a different character takes center stage. It took me longer to warm up to Antoinette than the leads in each of the others, but I trusted French's character and plot development skills and stuck with it. It paid off and left me wondering what happens next in the squad. Really hope there will be another in the series, but I'll read her other titles in the meantime!"
"Should have the title Paranoia. Antoinette's at the beginning starts to grate. Aislin's is far fetched. Good writing though a little too gritty at points. Did it really need a dead cat? Plot took you along nicely even though it didn't all hang together well. Would a detective forget that the Missing man's daughter was called Aislin? Neat ending but why did the chief have to go?
By the way how do you spell bollocks?"
"Felt very much like reading an episode of Law and Order SVU or Criminal Minds. I thoroughly enjoyed the banter thoughout the whole book although the similes got kind of old-- describing thoughts and ideas as sharp, giving them tastes and smells, etc...The frequency of this technique was a little annoying to me.
I really love that even though I figured out the WHO of the mystery early on, the untangling of events was super fun and exciting to read."
"The plotting felt tighter than in previous Dublin Murder Squad outings, and the stakes were a little higher as the protagonist appeared to be fighting the squad itself for most of the book. The ending appears to perhaps point the series in a different direction, and it's not clear who the next point-of-view character could be, but if this is the conclusion, it's a satisfying one."
"Originally posted on Reading Autistically.

Just released in hardback in the UK, The Trespasser is the sixth installment in the excellent Dublin Murder Squad series which started with In The Woods back in 2007. I have been eagerly awaiting this book's release since binge-reading the previous five back in April, grabby hands held at the ready to pick this up at my first opportunity. So of course when it came through my letterbox a few days ago I immediately sat down to read, and devoured it almost whole.

This series follows the various detectives on the fictional Dublin murder squad, each book dealing with the investigation of a new crime and told from the point of view of a different character. All six novels so far can very much be read as stand-alones, each is a self-contained mystery that doesn't spoil the revelations of those that came before it, so you would have no problems jumping in right here. Of course I would recommend going in order, just for the added depth of context and background that experience provides, we meet each narrating character in one or more of the previous books, our lead here for example played a significant role in the fifth story, The Secret Place, but going back to the start is by no means essential.

While this is very much a crime series full of murder mysteries that are begging to be solved, it is far more about its characters, who they are and what makes them tick. These books are fascinating character studies, crime fiction but with a more literary slant, beautifully written and complex. All of the characters are three dimensional and interesting, from the adorably lovable Steven Moran and the definitely up to something Breslin, through to the at first apparently blank-slate murder victim who has far more hiding behind her shiny catalogue exterior, and main suspect Rory who straddles the line between endearingly naive and really very creepy. But best of all is of course our narrator, Antoinette Conway.

Conway is a badass and I love her. The only woman currently on the squad, mixed-raced and from a less than affluent background, she is used to life throwing her a whole bunch of lemons. Her response is pretty much to punch the lemons into submission. Antoinette was a great and intriguing character in her previous appearance but here we get to take a trip inside her wonderfully snarky head, to see the parts that she doesn't show, to revel in her internal eye-rolling and cringe at her mounting paranoia. We get to see her slightly more vulnerable spots, the issues around the father who was gone before she was even born, and the very real effect of the bullying she's getting from inside the squad. She faces it all with her very own brand of steel, occasionally making you want to scream in frustration, her reactions often against typical expectations, but always so very deliciously in character.

For the first time we are seeing a much more unpleasant side of the squad, with other detectives taking the place of outright antagonists instead of allies or mildly annoying hindrances. Conway is forced to be constantly on alert around her colleagues after being systematically harassed, bullied, and gaslighted, with no idea how many are involved, who if anyone she can trust, if she can even trust her own judgement about it anymore. It leaves a deep feeling of unease throughout as we stay on edge with her, doubting everyone on every side, unsure what is really malicious activity and what is just her imagination, what is a misplaced piece of paper or deliberate sabotage. Watching this very strong character start to lose her grip, start to doubt herself and contemplate giving up something she has always dreamed of, was probably the most compelling part of the book for me.

The mystery itself was enthralling too, as usual with French, I had a few inklings about who might have been involved but it definitely kept me questioning the details and second guessing myself over every reveal. Were there gangsters involved, or corruption, or was it really just a fatal end to a lovers spat? Though there was clearly something off, I could never quite decide what I thought it was without it being immediately pulled out from under me. The reveal of what really happened and why was pretty satisfying, another story that dredges into the worst of humanity, and something that you really don't want me to spoil for you, a bit of a theme right now as I don't want to tell you much about anything to do with the greater plot or Conway's development, it is all much better discovered for yourself.

Though this is not my favourite of this wonderful series, that crown still belongs to The Likeness and The Secret Place, this was a very solid entry. When even the worst of a series is as good as this you can't really go wrong, it is well worth a read whether you want to just jump straight in here or go back to the beginning. If you are looking for a good mystery with a bit more depth, a character study, or just a cracking read with some fantastic writing, this would be a great choice. Now I just have to start waiting for the next one, I wonder who the next narrator will be..."
"Antoinette wasn't expecting the degree of harassment she experiences when she finally wins a spot on the Dublin Murder Squad, but she is tough and determined to succeed. She and her partner Steven land a case that turns out to be more complex and politically fraught than it at first appeared to be. "
I wanted to love this. I really did because let's face it it's Tana French. She can do no wrong. It took me a while to get interested. Once I did I read it through until the end. I just thought it was very different from her other books. It wasn't as captivating. It didn't hold my attention and not let go.
"I liked the book. I enjoy Tana French detective stories set in Ireland. This read was a particularly good one because it came from all angles to get it solved. I thought it gave great insight into the Murder Squad detectives thoughts, behavior and ""team work/camaraderie"". Unusual. Tana writes good cop stories."
"This felt like it could maybe have been a touch shorter, but I was still thoroughly engaged by the story and captivated by Tana French's writing. This was a little more straight detective than some of her others have been, and I missed the quasi-supernatural weird elements, but it also added something new--the inter-squad drama, the ""who can you trust"" questions, the cop psychology."
"Detective Conway and Moran are fairly new to the Detective
Squad for Murders. They have only handled minor cases.
Now they are given a murder of a young girl which seems
pretty simple, but turns into something more than a simple
solve.
Love French's writing and all the extra details she puts into her
novels."
"I had not read a Tana French book in awhile and though there were times I wasn't 100% interested in the story, by the end I enjoyed the mystery and was intrigued to find out how it would end. I really like the glimpse into Ireland, especially with the slang that occasionally I would have to look up the meaning of. "
"Meh. I'm sorry to say that I want to like her latest novels more than I do. This was pretty straight procedural. Kept waiting for a twist, there were some small, but predictable, and the main character was just so paranoid and unlikeable. I always think that is a sign of good writing, a character you really don't like, but she was just tiresome. It just wasn't that interesting.

3 stars."
"[library audiobook, plot summary elsewhere]

A really intense police procedural. It went on too long, with multiple plot twists, to rate 5 stars, but was too dense to give less than 4. The main character, Antoinette Conway was a little too nasty to get into. With French, the ending is sometimes unresolved, which gives tension until the end."
"I always enjoy Tana French's novels, and this was no exception. (But I think my favorite will always be In the Woods.) I love her fresh characters and I enjoy how they overlap from book to book. After reading The Trespasser, I feel like she is actually a better writer than she has been in earlier novels. Can't wait until the next one ... hope Steve is in it!"
"I find hard to name my favorite Tana French novel. The protagonist in this story, as in other stories, is difficult, challenging, righteous, very very frustrating. If you like French, you'll like this one very much. If you're looking to enter the world of Tana French, then I might suggest you start at the beginning, with In the Woods."
"my first time with this author and now I guess I am going to have to go back and read/listen to the previous books in this series. I loved the story and the characters. It kept me listening and I thought the ending was good. So often the endings are disappointing. If you need an escape from reality, give this one a try."
"This was my first read of this series. Once again I don't read but listen to, and I did find the narration hard to understand at times. Not the narrator's fault, as she did a very nice job but the dialect was hard to understand at times so it made the book a tad bit more cumbersome than I like. BUT I did enjoy the story itself very much."
"Another good Tana French--I figured out the group the killer belonged to very early, and I thought the explanation of why Conway and Moran didn't was a little thin. That said, I stayed up late to finish it, and was So Relieved that French finally let a female Detective last more than one book on the squad. I really like Antoinette and her judgement/fair play to yous with Aislinn."
"The interiority of this book began to get to me around the 300-page mark. I love Tana French, but I read these books when I'm looking for plot-based page-turners, and this wasn't it. The interrogation/interview scenes were well-written but ultimately I wanted less thinking/theory spinning and more doing. "
"Maybe it's not quite 5 star, but the characters really developed. I didn't enjoy the main character narrator right away. The side characters' motivations (or, lack thereof) were interesting. I still think Faithful Place was her best one, as well as Broken Harbor. But, while the relationships in here weren't family, they were like family--so, interesting as they developed."
"One thing I like about Tana French is her skillful use of the unreliable narrator. Det. Conway isn't unreliable in the traditional sense (not an alcoholic, a drug addict, or mentally ill.) Pleasurably, it took me a while to realize that.

I didn't warm to this one as much as I've loved some of her previous novels, but French is a skilled writer, and is always worthwhile reading."
"Let me start by saying I adore Tana French. I recommend her books to everyone. This book moved a little slower than others and felt like it dragged in parts. I also had a harder time getting in to it because Detective Conway can be so unlikeable. That said, it was well written and a very interesting storyline. I would've given it 3.5 stars if I could. "
"Another gem by Tana French. Like many of the other reviewers I always find her books to be well written with three dimensional characters that you feel like you really know. The mystery itself is really secondary to what's playing out with the characters' lives, but it's definitely what drives the storyline. Just enough surprises to keep it interesting. "
"I love Tana French and I think she's actually getting even better, which is refreshing because by the 6th book in a series I think a lot of writers start to phone it in.

I loved Antoinette, she's a strong female lead. My only complaint is that the pacing maybe felt a bit off in this one. It was slower through the middle with a lot of new information at the end."
"Antoinette Conway was thrilled to be part of the Murder Squad, until she wasn't.
Interesting police procedural. The book started out as a very slow read, but once it reached its stride I could not put it down until I finished. Still not sure about the ending, but may reread parts just to figure it out."
"A great read, with gritty characters and full-on suspense. The Irish slang words are a tad irritating. The main character, Antoinette, is so bitter that it's tough to identify with her, but the action keeps you race-reading till the surprise ending. Love French's wordsmithing and complex imagery. Definitely going to read the next in the series. "
"Quite a fun book! A very good murder mystery, and a fun introduction to the characters. I feel the overall arc to the story wasn't horribly surprising, and the sidekick could have been fleshed out just a bit more - maybe a bit more disgruntled with the main character =) But overall a very fun novel that I would heartily recommend"
"A very good entry in Tana French's series. Not my favorite (see Faithful Place and The Likeness) but not my least favorite (see Broken Harbor). The story is original and the characters have depth. The writing, as usual, is naturally immersive and gives you a real feel for the scene. My only criticism is that Ms. French's protagonists sometimes get a little neurotic. "
"Perhaps not as good as previous books. I felt there was extra details at the end after the murder investigation which made it difficult to have guessed the murderer. A little too much about our lady inspector's past history which has already been written into previous novels.
Would still read any of her novels however."
"I love Tana French ... but this character is a little too self-conscious, self-centered, and conspiracy-minded. Sure, she has reason to suspect her male co-workers of being out to get her, but she seems like the kind of chick who would tell them early on to go F themselves and move on. Anyway ... pretty good."
"From my review in the latest issue of STRAND Magazine: good book!

""And finally, there’s the mystery, which is a good one. It takes the reader to some surprising places while leaving us to ponder whether Antoinette Conroy is not the only person who’s a prisoner of the mind, an idea compellingly explored by Tana French. The Trespasser is a hell of a good novel."""
"The first half of this book I found quite difficult, it wasn't gripping me and I found my mind wandering to other things and having to keep re reading pages. By the second half of the book I got to grips with the style of writing and couldn't put the book down. A few twists and turns and kept me guessing until the end. "
I don't know how French does it - this was so compelling and I couldn't wait to pick it back up/had a hard time putting it down but also not much happens?? I don't know if Antoinette was my favorite narrator - the paranoia got to be a bit much - but I just really liked following along with the case and watching it unfold. 
AWESOME book!!! The was my first Tana French book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Detective Antoinette Conway is a pretty cool character and I can't wait to get to know her better. I didn't realize this was a series so I'm going to go back and start with the first novel. So happy to know that I might have 5 more awesome books to read.
"Outstanding reading by Hilda Faye. Good story line and good characters, but FAR TO0 MANY subplots and personal squabbles. It just dragged out too much and took so long to reach a climax. The climax, however, was very good – if you can stick it out. I would have dropped it half-way through except for the excellent reading Hilda Fay. She needs to do more readings."
"Although crime is not my most-read genre, Tana French is an automatic read for me. Her characterisation is sublime, so deep and nuanced, and while some of her books have been more 'scary' than others (I couldn't sleep for a while after some) each was has been beautifully written. French also masters the police procedural aspect of her books each time. This is another recommended read for me."
"Rewarding, but sometimes tedious, reading.

Rewarding because the murder case is engaging, with lots of twists that make a reader wonder what's coming next.

Tedious because the detective has so many doubts, insecurities, paranoias, etc., which she rehashes continuously. Yes, this aspect of the detective's personality gives her depth; however, this weakness makes the book drag.
"
"I have mixed feelings about this book. Part of me, really enjoyed the detectives’ process. However, the main character did rub me the wrong way through most of the book. As far as the story goes, it is a well-written detective story. I did not have figured out who the killer was until right before it was revealed. I always find that a good sign of a well-written mystery story."
"Tana French is an amazing writer who creates realistic dialogue between her characters. I enjoyed reading this book but thought it was a bit difficult to get through at times. I thought the pace lagged in the middle, but towards the end the interview scenes were vivid. Didn’t see the twist coming at the end! Leaves you thinking even after you’ve finished. "
"This is the first book I’ve read from the author, and it was difficult for me to develop any rapport with the characters, probably for that reason. I was also a bit disconcerted by the slang, but adjusted to that. The plot is well developed and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. Overall, it’s a good police procedural."
"First time I have listened to a Tana French book. Thought the Irish accents added quite a bit to the mood of the tale.

Many twists and turns to the resolution of Aislinn Murray’s murder. The interplay amidst the detective staff was most enjoyable.

French is a superb mystery novelist.

Cloud library—audiobook."
"To me, nothing will top Tana French's In the Woods, but this comes a very close second. I read her previous Conway/Moran book The Secret Place last year and was underwhelmed (I do think she misses the mark about every other book), but The Trespasser puts me right back in that sweet spot as a reader: This. Is. Why. I. Read.

Antoinette Conway is a protagonist like no other. I loved her. I really hope that French uses her again for another story in the series (for those unfamiliar, the author switches main characters every book). Hell, I'd be happy if the rest of the series was just Conway and Stephen Moran. Such a pair. The mystery here was fantastic - she absolutely had me guessing. But it's the complexity to the characters that really brought it home for me. This is not your standard mystery fare. I can't recommend this book enough.

Why only 4 stars instead of 5? I have no idea. Maybe because nothing can top In the Woods in my heart! But seriously, this is a GREAT ride.

Thank you, Tana French! Thank you."
"Was looking for a mystery/thriller for my book club pick and was recommended this book. It is a great thriller, my first experience with the Dublin Murder Squad and I'll be looking to go back and read the rest, from the beginning. I loved how I was never sure what was going on, didn't even know if the narrator was reliable. A really good mystery. "
Tana French actually writes interesting mysteries. The characters are interesting and the shift in focus of main character in each book keeps the series intriguing. I really enjoyed Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran and their relationship in the book. Even when you have figured out who the killer is - there is always a twist at the end that keeps you on edge until the end of the book.
"I was a bit disappointed by this showing in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Compared to the prior books it felt like it lacked a meaningful mystery (though it came around in the end) and seemed much more social commentary on gender discrimination (a real and important issue, just not sure if it came off well in this book) vs. individually managing workplace and life challenges."
"I don't typically read murder/mystery books, but I enjoyed this one. I read a Tana French novel several years ago and forgot how well written it was, so I might add another to my list. One thing that I liked was there wasn't an undue amount of blood -n- guts or psychological intensity, just a good detective book with excellent character development."
"Detective books aren’t my usual thing but this one was good. Love how they got all twisted up in their thinking. I like how they didn’t treat people as all good or all bad... but humans with human errors and human instincts. Narrorator was good too so the lovely Irish accent was a treat. Listened at 1.25x

I’d like to read the first in this series but will have to order a paper copy."
"The high level of descriptive writing at first felt overwhelming. I wanted just a few simple declarative sentences to give my brain a rest! Then, however, I got into the plot and found this book to be a page turner. With the descriptive writing, I didn't want to miss even one word. I will now read other books in the series and recommend this author to others."
"The story kept me enthralled. I loved the development of the main character - her internal dialogue, her struggle to recognize her own faults, and the realizations along the way.

As always, I was disappointed in the need to use such vulgar language. I thought about going back to read the other books in the series, but think I will pass."
"Overall this book is really good. I picked it up at the USO at Fort McCoy. I would have given it 5 stars but I felt like the chapters were too long. There was just something about the over explanation of detail that threw me off. I will find another book by this author, as I did enjoy overall plot to this book and did come to a point were I wasn’t ready for it to end. "
"4.25 - The Trespasser starts out slow and tedious but spellbinding with its mid-directions and clues. The dialogue during Conway and Moran’s interrogation of the murderer was superb and masterful. Tana French can write her arse off. She allows you, as the reader, to glimpse into the personalities of her characters by exposing their psychological dysfunctions and strengths. Enjoy!"
"This was the first book I read in this series and I really enjoyed it. The police thriller was about what appears to be a domestic squabble gone wrong, but turns into much more. I loved the audio book - so cool to hear the Irish accents, and I thought there was a perfect sense of menace, almost like a horror novel."
"This was my first Tana French novel, and well worth it, if only for the interrogations. Anyone interested in reading or writing mysteries would do well to study and enjoy them, though a bit of trimming wouldn't have hurt. The main character has a real ""attitude"" that might put some off, but for me, it was a refreshing change from the worn-out, depressed, divorced, aging veteran cop syndrome."
"I haven’t read a Tana French novel since her brilliant international bestseller The Secret Place. I’d always meant to go back and read her backlist but never got round to it. This is her latest novel and another terrific crime mystery. I feel The Secret Place might be the better novel, technically speaking, but I still thoroughly enjoyed this. "
"The last 100 pages of this book saved it for me. The first 300 were okay. I've always enjoyed Tana French novels, but the first part of this was kind of a slog. I'm glad I persisted though! She presented complicated/semi-sterotype characters that I loved getting to know. Would recommend for people who enjoy a good mystery. "
"My only complaint about this book is that I expected the twist to be a bit more...exciting, I guess? Seemed a little bit obvious, but still had a better ending than In the Woods. I do enjoy her writing, though, couldn't stop reading it! Plus, she made a Star Wars reference, which is always appreciated. Overall an enthralling read that I would definitely recommend"
"psychologically compelling

This is a gripping read not only with plot twists but also offers a visceral feeling of the lead character’s internal confusion, conflicts and struggles. At one point that visceral sense reminded me strongly of the crazy feeling readers got from Dennis LaHanes Shutter Island."
"I enjoyed this crime novel by Tana French but I would not call her novels taut. There are multiple story lines which are interesting and distracting from the main plot. I do enjoy her books as a departure from my normal reading. However, I usually must skim read the last 100 pages because I want to find out who committed the crime and move on."
"Good read

Enjoyed the story. Good twists and believable, likeable characters. I personally was a little irritated by the use of just the initial D instead of the word detective, but maybe that's just me and this is common to the place of the book. Overall though a good story and I will be reading more by this author"
"A rookie on the Murder Squad, Antoinette struggles to break into the 'good ol' boys' group of detectives.
The murder case she and her partner are given turns out to be WAY more than just the cut and dried 'he did it' case.

Was interesting from the very start, it had lots of twists and turns, and I couldn't wait to read more of it to find out how it ended."
"Rated 8.5 out of 10. I’ve read all of Tana French’s mysteries, and this is one of her best. I literally could not put this book down. Bitingly sarcastic (ie funny) detectives, infighting within the murder squad, a plot with a generous degree of twists and turns, nasty pranks, numerous head games, and surprises... What more could you want? "
"Gripping police procedural featuring a strong, smart, fearless, angry, smartass female detective who happens to be an unreliable narrator with issues that need working through--a nice twist to the point of view from which the story is told.
Excellent narration on this audio CD, by actress Hilda Fay."
"Maybe its the rise of the #MeToo movement and the timing of when I read this book, but I loved it from tip to tail. The unreliable narrator and main character Det. Antoinette Conway was real, gritty and a voice I had never heard before. Loved the realistic pace of the murder case. Just wonderful. Tana French is one of my favorite modern mystery writers. "
Tana French is an absolute master of the police procedural interrogation sequence. By my count there are five interrogations in The Trespasser and each plays like a World Cup match with the tension and anticipation building exponentially until one side breaks through leading to either frustration or a fist-shaking triumph. Brilliant! 
"#6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. Detectives Conway and Moran are investigating the aftermath of a domestic dispute. While everyone else seems convinced it's a standard open and shut case, they're not so sure. Or are they just overcomplicating things?

I love French's writing style. Her characters are so well crafted, and the stories just suck you in. I totally lost track of time when they started closing in on the killer!"
"French’s characters intrigue me. Antoinette Conway’s complexity is sometimes maddening, both to the other detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad and to the reader. Still, she comes across as very realistic.

As for the case she is working open, this one was less satisfying than many in French’s other novels. The book was too long, I think. It could have used some editing.

"
"I liked this much more than the Likeness, which was somewhat implausible. The main character has an interesting back story that colors her view of life and her work and make her a bit paranoid, possibly not a bad thing for a murder detective. The plot had a number of twists and turns and it was good for a summer read. "
"Amazed at the variation of plot/writing through Dublin Squad series. This was a stunner, right up there like #1 as a masterclass in crime writing.
Great plotting, characters, convincing twists and turns, a bunch of unknowns bugging the investigation right up to final pages.
Brilliant compulsively page-turning stuff..."
"Loved it. Tana French back in form. Antoinette Conway was a good character. The twists and turns had me going. I really wanted to pay attention and see where this was headed. The red herrings swim so fast and in such quantity, your head will spin. Is she a reliable narrator? What’s really going on—outside the mystery as well as within? I’m not telling. "
"I loved parts of this book and hated others. This book gave me such stress and high blood pressure (or could be in combo with the political sh!t going on right now). Anyway, not sure how I feel about the end, there was some justice served but I would have preferred seeing all those f*ckers go down and I really wanted to see Conway kick Roche's ass. Why am I so angry right now... haha."
"This book grew on me. Set, as usual, in Dublin, the story revolves around a female detective who is trying to establish herself in a precinct full of men, who she believes don't want her there. She is assigned what seems to be a routine murder. As they investigate, she and her partner discover it is anything but routine and might involve someone they know.

"
"I think that this book had more dialogue in it than any novel that I have read. It is almost exclusively dialogue with small bits of inner monologue. Sometimes it gets a little bit exhausting, but it is always rewarding. At the conclusion of the book you know you’ve read something written by a master."
"At first this book was slow going but by the end it really picked up.
Make no mistake - the Dublin Murder Squad series is dreary, with little humour.
However, Tana French makes up for it by making incredibly well written intricate
mysteries that are ORIGINAL.
It took me a while to get into this but once I did I was hurrying home from work to
finish it."
Woke at 2 am and had to finish this one. The sole woman detective on the murder squad fears the other Ds are trying to sabotage her. As she begins her investigation into what appears to be a standard domestic murder she begins to question everything. She has to trust her frayed instincts and she will need to learn who she can rely on to solve this case. 
"Brilliant book. French is a master of manipulating your feelings for and about characters. All the way to the end, you can’t know how it will all play out. But this isn’t some flashy tv show with a big twist and surprise happy ending. Like all French’s books, this is real and people get hurt. People lose. Gritty and beautiful. Excellent read."
"Tana French books are like a childhood friend. You may not get together super frequently but when you do things are familiar and great.

The best part of this book isn’t the “who dunnit” but instead the way the detectives play off each other and their interviewees. The questions and answers and back and forth are so honest and true."
"Antoinette is new on the murder squad. Being the only woman, she is subjected to much derision. She and her partner, Steve, are given a case that appears to be domestic violence. The victim Aislinn’s new boyfriend, Rory is the suspect. The squad wants them to make a quick arrest but they begin to have doubts. Another good mystery by Tana French. "
"I don't know another author who can match Tana French for authentic dialog or psychological awareness. Having said that, man, it's easy to read her books and feel like people really, truly suck. The Trespasser has that, certainly, but although it has bleak moments to it, it doesn't stay in them forever. Not my absolute favorite of hers, but near the top!"
"Like most of Tana French's novels, there are times when the number of pages spent learning about the characters can make the book feel like it's dragging at times. But at the 2/3 mark, the time you've invested getting to know these people really pays off and you can't put it down until it's finished. "
"Enjoyed this one--though a touch less than the Witch Elm. 

I loved being in the mind of one of her detectives this time; super appreciated the story of what it's like to work in a heavily male-dominated environment....and how that can impact your actual work. Watching Antoinette unraveling under the real and perceived pressure of her colleagues felt so real and relevant. I've never read anything that conveyed that pressure so well.

What I am generally enjoying about her books is the sense of how much the narrator's experiences change the way they investigate the crime--and how much the investigation or the crime changes them.  They're not iconic heroes who resume their regular life after a massive puzzle gets solved. They're changed, permanently, by this event.  

Also, she's so good at subtext--you know what the characters are thinking as much by what they don't say as what they do. Learning a lot from her about dialogue. Totally enjoyable. "
" I enjoyed this, my first novel by Tana French. Having visited Ireland on several occasions, I appreciated the dialogue between the officers of the police force, spoken in true Irish fashion. French does a wonderful job of getting the reader intrigued with the challenges posed within a department of detectives and the competition and politics involved."
As I was reading this I kept having flashback thinking somehow I had read something similar or seen a movie like this?? Nope I had read this before! Luckily it’s that good that it makes it worth it! Conway is a strong female lead and having her supporting male Moran makes them a team you are routing for! Great mystery and nice twist!
"I just love these books. I am always wondering whodunit and what happened, with the bonus of wondering if there’s something bigger going on with the detective. The only negative - and this is the reason I liked The Secret Place so much more than other people seemed to - is that, other than that one, they all feel very much the same. Conway has a similar voice and attitude as basically every other narrator in this series (except Moran, whose naïveté and positivity was a breath of fresh air for me). With all the talk around how close detectives have to be with their partners, I just want to see more of that from French - it’s not conflict, but that bit doesn’t have to be an added conflict to the story anyway. I was glad to see how this wrapped up and I’m looking forward to the next one!"
"I read this book for my book club so I read the discussion questions first and I began to look for clues early on. Figured it out in the 1st quarter. Too many Ngaio Marsh, PD James, Agatha Christie books and PBS Brit crime whodunits not to have figured it out but enjoyed the way it was put together. Didn't spoil the read."
"I'm so glad the author chose to make Detective Conway the main character in this book. She is such a complex, interesting character. And as usual the balance between plot advancement and character development was outstanding. I felt totally involved with the action and the people throughout the book. Please keep writing!"
"This book has a great plot buried in incredibly slow pacing of the story. It could probably lose a quarter of the pages and still be a thrilling mystery. Strong character development and an interesting exposure to local jargon-- would benefit from an index of sorts. Overall, a good read that perhaps needed a read through of it's predecessors to be fully appreciated."
"Exceptionally good writing. Maybe it was a little slow and the murder case wasn't that exciting, but it didn't matter since I forgot I was reading a crime novel and could have just followed detective Conway around for another 500 pages listening to her inner monologue.
I will definitely have to read more from French."
I feel like I've said it all about Tana French. The characters! The pacing! The darkness! The incredible Irish accents that somehow leap off the page without ever veering into stereotypes! The villians! The broken detectives! I particularly loved the dynamics of race in Ireland and women present here and I did not see the murderer coming--the highest praise I can give any mystery novel. 
"I should really give it a 5, but I save those for books that change how I think and see the world. This was one of her best - I stayed up late to finish it before I left for a trip. I did have trouble connecting the personalities of the 2 detectives to the last book (The Secret Place). They seem so different. "
I had only read the first book in this Dublin Murder Squad series and grabbed this on audio for a trip. I love the fact that each book can be read as a standalone because each book is told by a different detective on the squad. This did not disappoint. I look forward to meeting the rest of the squad.
"I enjoyed this book. I had it both on audio and on e-book . My original purpose was to listen to while jogging. But I found myself spending hours reading the ebook because I was enjoying it so much.

I liked the setting in Dublin. I liked the constant tension between characters, I liked the female protagonist.

Some of the plot gets a little tired, but don't they all."
"Overall a 4.5 for me. I listened to the audio book and the narrator sold me on the plot for most of it. It was a bit slow, but I really love the characters and how much French purs us into their process and feelings. Interesting plot but just not as captivating as the first three books in this series."
"Each book this is the 2nd time I've dislikes the narrorator of the book by french while actually liking the book as a whole.

Also works as a very nice commentary on the effects of harassment at the workplace and how the lack of acknowledgement of it by those uninvolved worsens the entire experience."
A 4.5 The voice actress was incredible making this a book I could hardly put down. I loved the Irish setting as well. The protagonist had some problems to work out but the problems and the solutions seemed realistic. Overall very good book. I may consider another book in the series and I hardly ever do that. 
"French does not disappoint. This book was very interesting with the investigation into fellow Murder Ds and the complexity of such a thing. I struggled with Conway's character and her self-absorption, however the harassment she dealt with felt all too real. I hope French will keep going with this series! Though I'm not so interested in Breslin..."
"Although this was a good book, sections of it just went on way too long. In particular, a couple of the interrogations of suspects and the interviews of a couple of witnesses were interminable.

I'm seeing this more and more frequently in cop books, movies, and tv shows. I'm hoping that it's just dramatic license that portrays police officers as this evil towards each other."
"Super solid writing and a tightly constructed plot. Loved that French returned in this novel to focusing attention on the solving of the crime itself, as opposed to creating heavy psychological backstories for her characters. There was just enough psychology to keep it interesting without drowning out the plot. "
"A worthy ending of this series, at least I think it is the end? Her latest is a stand-alone and I can't see the series coming back from this. A welcome switch from the supernatural to paranoia and the human mind, too. I also want to punch most of the men of the DMS in the balls.

Only drawback is it's still too long winded."
"This was a good one in the succession of Dublin Murder Squad, but it nearly lost a star for me with Conway's incessant negativity. I get chronic pessimism (been there) but it was gratuitously ""woe is me"" laced with paranoia for too long. That said, the ending really pulled the book together and the last chapter in particular was excellent."
"My favorite Tana French book since “In the Woods,” “The Trespasser” strikes a much more hopeful note than her previous outings. This is a world in which mistakes can be forgiven and wrongs can be righted, which is different than many of her previous outings. I think this hopeful note made the book more satisfying in the end. "
"Overall, a good read of a detailed, perhaps too detailed, police procedural. Much of the 'action' takes place in the mind, reasoning, thinking, agonizing, worrying, of the main character. While it is a complicated plot it is understandable throughout. I just found some areas, especially the interrogations, too long. "
"As with most Tana French novels, this one is a slowburn. The plot wasn’t groundbreaking but the way Tana French writes will make you love the heroine Antoinette Conway’s bitchy narrative and make you feel sorry for other characters, inspite of yourself. Not her best work (Broken Harbour is still my fave) but still good."
"Good

I don’t know. I think I read too much. This book was good, well-written and held my interest to keep at it, but even though I was still hanging on until the very last page, I couldn’t read it straight away. Lots of stops and stops. I think I will try another of her books and see if they all just leave me a little short of satisfied."
"I enjoyed this book. A little slow to start. The main-characters arch of defensiveness was annoying at times but ultimately worth it. I also guessed two of the book's mysteries (including the murder). I don't know if I've read enough murder mysteries to know if that is a bad trait. All in all, a good read. Makes me want to go to Ireland, or be Irish, even in January. "
"Antoinette Conway is the only female detective in the murder Squad, Dublin, Ireland. She's lacks complete self confidence which gets in her way during her investigation of 26-year-old Aislinn's murder. But in the last 50 pages or so, things finally get wrapped up. Tana French is a good writer, but I kept having to look up phrases and terms that are Ireland specific. "
I really enjoyed the audiobook. This was both a murder mystery and a character study of Detective Antoinette Conway. I loved having Conway's voice and her f-them philosophy in my head. It was also satisfying as she became more self aware and realized that many things are not as she thought. 
"The last book in the series! Although these books don't read as fast for me as your typical thriller, I thoroughly enjoy the writing style and appreciate the way the author details out both her characters and the plot line. I think these are a great series if you enjoy a good police procedural and would recommend to anyone looking for a little heavy hitter in the thriller department!"
"The sixth of the author's Dublin Murder Squad series finds us delving a little deeper into the life of Antoinette Conway. We get to learn more about her past and what she has endured personally and professionally that has forced her to harden herself to the world around her. We also get to follow her as she uncovers secrets of her victim's past that have forced her down a very dangerous path, ending in her demise. The story is tragic and at times painful in that you just want to shake the victim and steer her to safety. This is yet another great addition to a great series that I think is worth checking out. "
"Another one of Tana French's great stories.

Antoinette Conway are partners on The Dublin Murder Squad; they have just finished a night shift and are given another murder to solve. A young woman is found dead and they need to figure out who did it. After many turns and twists they get their man."
"This was a bit long and was dominated by dialogue. But it did keep my interest through it. There were a few twists that kept the story moving. There were times I couldn’t put the book down. Even though I didn’t think this was one of Tana French’s best books, I can still recommend it. Tana French has been one of my favorite and consistent writers. "
Murder investigation with the duo of detectives from The Secret Place is a wild ride as the team fights one another and at times the rest of the Murder Squad to see it through— even if it costs them their jobs. The whodunnit is not surprising but the twist at the end shows that much of what detective Antoinette Conway thought to be true is all in her head!
"This is an interesting view of 2 detectives trying to pin down the guilty killer when all points to a specific suspect and the murder squad are steering them toward that suspect. They suspect that the ""squad"" is hiding something. It may sound tedious but the process is very interesting. I do like the way Ms. French writes and was never bored."
"Another great entry into the Dublin Murder Squad. French is a master story teller who focuses on character development. While at times the story may seem slow, I have to remind myself that that I'm gathering so much information. For new readers you can check out this book independently and do not need to read in order. "
"Another amazing read from Tana French. Her books are like a cozy rainy Sunday afternoon that you want to come back to again and again. As always I loved the dynamic between her characters. If you like detective novels or suspense in general, this series should skyrocket to the top of your WTR pile.
"
"I tried to read this once before, but couldn’t get into it. Kept getting hung up in the unfamiliar slang terms and bogged down. A couple years have passed since and I tried again. I’m glad I did - it took about 100 pages to get hooked , but once I was, it was almost un-put-downable. I’d like to read more from this author."
"Dublin murder squad detective Antoinette and her partner Stephen work well together, though there have been some bumps. As usual, French gives us a complex and fascinating mystery. The sexism that Antoinette faces among her colleagues adds an extra dimension to life in the Dublin Murder Squad. Although this is book 6, it is not necessary to have read the previous books in the series."
"Tana French's 'Dublin Murder Squad' series is the best crime fiction series out there at the moment. Her feeling for dialogue and place is just superb and she manages to draw the reader in until they feel almost a part of the story. She captures the constantly shifting psychology of her main protagonist Antoinette Conway, as her feelings shift and twist and change. It's exhilarating but also exhausting though that doesn't make you want to disengage. You have to keep reading, not for the big reveal, but for the incessant pressure of the narrative to finally come to rest."
"I loved the unexpected twists and turns - didn’t end the way I thought it would at all. I love Tana French, but this one is more inside baseball of the Murder Squad than the rest of the series. I’m always a fan of the female POV protagonists, and Antoinette Conway’s journey is my favorite part of the book. Also got some good chuckles out of me."
This mystery contained a catalog of the ways men bully and abuse women in a work environment. This crap has to be exposed in order to confront and prevent it! I found the interviewing strategies used by these detectives to be interesting. The characters were believable and the plot kept me turning the pages! I wonder if the bad grammar is intentional. 
This is my first book of Tana French's. Might have been a good idea to start with #1 in the series but I don't feel like I was missing any subplots while reading. Went a little long for me but Conway character was really good - I like her toughness and how she and Moran play off each other. Not a big twist at the end but felt satisfying. 
"In January, reading Tana French or Stephen King is a treat.
I have been following Tana French since her debut book, and tremendously enjoyed her first 4 books, she writes detective stories with a flair.
This book was great, may be a little too lengthy, with very long interviews, however the story and characters were very well constructed.
"
"Funny that the 2 main characters who I found so boring in book 5 were so much more interesting in book 6 (maybe bc the female was the narrator this time 🤷🏻‍♀️) Either way, overall I found this probably the most compelling of the series besides book two. There wasn’t much social commentary just a good mystery with an interesting premise that I think TF did a great job of pulling off."
"A different Tana French voice. This one is snarky, bold, battling and insistent. I throughly enjoyed solving a murder alongside Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve. They search for evidence, come up with theories, and face personal issues all the while looking over their shoulders to prevent their colleagues in the Murder squad from sabotaging their case."
Excellent mystery with all kinds of intrigues to consider as the plot unfolds. This is my first book by French and I will read more! I listened to this one with a reader using a strong Irish accent which enhanced the story though I had to listen closely to ensure I understood the dialect. It was quite the tale! 
"I am OBSESSED with the way this series went full circle from Rob and Cassie disintegrating to Antoinette and Steve building a real partnership together. I am obsessed with the way this series is actually about that desperate longing for human connection with a few pesky murder cases thrown in. I want like, a thousand more."
"A solid addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series. I found myself a little impatient with the protagonist and her persecution complex. She’s easily the least likable of the detectives featured in the series. But I’m not one of those people who needs to like the main character to enjoy a book, so the satisfying plot was sufficient to make this a four start read."
"My rating system:
5 stars: The best I've read in a while & for sure will re-read in the future.
4 stars: Still a great book, and will re-read in the future... just didn't knock it out of the park completely.
3 stars: Good book, but probably too predictable.
2 stars: Finished the book, but didn't like it.
1 star: Hated it; wouldn't even finish it.
"
"This is such a great series, with an excellent narrator. I love that they're each standalone, though characters from previous stories appear as incidental characters in each one. I hope the main two in this one (Conway and Moran? I think that's right) come back - I like the way they interact, and I'd love to see Conway interact with the rest of the squad without the paranoid chip on her shoulder."
Detective Antoinette Conway will make you hold your breath as she dials Moran's number. Not because of the risk of a criminal but because of what it takes to ask someone for help. Excellent character work (duh!) and a closer look at the murder squad with its internal politics than in any of the previous books.
".

I have now read all of the Dublin Murder Squad books and loved them. This one didn't do it for me. For one there was too much raw language. Also took too long getting the story going. I enjoyed the last third and the ending. This lady is a fantastic writer.I think I have read all of her books now and would recommend her to anyone who likes crime mysteries."
"4.5-4.75 stars. Wow, another winner from Tana French. Loved how bitchy and yet absolutely likable the main character, Conway, is. And her dynamic with her partner, Moran, is perfect. I also laughed out loud a few times at the biting sarcasm in some bits of dialogue. And of course, as with all of French’s books, the plotting and deep characterizations are flawless. Highly recommend!"
"Tana French has the amazing ability to write really good stories with unbelievably unlikeable characters. Getting through the first half of this book was difficult; I kept putting it down because I really disliked the main protagonist. The second half really takes off, though, and it ended up being a good read. So 3.5, rounded up to 4 because there were some good surprises in the second half."
"Not every protagonist has to be likable, but eesh, this one made it a challenge sometimes. A chip on her shoulder the size of Texas. But, overall, that was part of her journey. The mystery was pretty well developed, and the story focused on it more than some of them which are more like a character drama with a mystery thrown in. It kept my interest."
"Audiobook. Wow, this author just blows me away! This is the last book in the Dublin Murder Mysteries. I love the characters and dialogue (especially when listening instead of reading). The plot was suspenseful and I stayed up late a few nights listening because I just had to know ""what happens next"". Highly recommend this and the other four books in this series."
"I was very impressed at how Tana French spun this story and how she got in the heads of the characters. Without giving too much away, I'd say she was also very clever with parallels across characters. Although I found it a bit slow in revving up, when it did pick up steam it became quite a page turner. "
"A murder mystery part of the Dublin Murder Squad series. Book 6 of 6 but the first one for me. Luckily you don’t need to read them in order. This one starts with a lovers’ quarrel gone wrong, leading to the death off Aislinn. Lead by newer Detective Antoinette Conway to dig around and get to the truth, from a very clean, too-clean, crime scene. This one had lots of twists and turns!"
"Antoinette Conway and her partner receive what seems to be a run of the mill domestic violence case that turns into a major disruption of their lives and their beliefs about being a murder detective.

This one felt like Tana French back to her best version. It was tight and close. I empathized with Antoinette and her experiences of being a woman in a world run by men."
"really enjoyed this!! french is great at writing an unreliable narrator. her pacing is slow but never boring, and her characters are really well thought-out. i think i enjoyed the searcher a little more, just because the atmosphere was so well done, but i'm definitely going to read more of the dublin murder squad books."
A good story the procedural takes a back seat to the psychology of soving the crime. The story is very much in the head of the protagonist. Sometimes her reactivity and paranoia got on my nerves. She is very high strung so its not a relaxing story. Now that I've finished the book I miss the world that Tana French constructed.
"This was a great book with likable characters. Loved the main character Antoinette Conway. I have even more respect and admiration for female police officers after reading this book.

The murder of a young woman the main character and her partner are tasked to solve is a page turner. Great book with twists."
"Gritty and charged with emotions. A relatively newer female detective, on what seems like a standard domestic murder case, finds herself following investigative clues while struggling with perceived red herrings. She and her partner try to make sense of tangled threads in the case and issues causing an undercurrent of trouble for them in their department."
I enjoyed this Tana French mystery. The uncertainty was cleverly woven throughout the entire book. My only reservation is that sometimes French tries to include too much. The nastiness in the Squad Room was not necessary. Conflict could be developed effectively without it. And the appearance of Antoinette’s father was a distraction. But I liked this book well enough to recommend it.
"This is as much a work place drama as a murder mystery. In the Dublin Murder Squad setting, the author puts us inside the head of the narrator Antoinette Conway as she navigates what can only be called a hostile work environment. The scenes are drawn out and the pacing is slow, but the colourful
Irish banter and the character study makes this an engaging read."
"The formula and style are consistent (predictable, but not in a bad way) by the last book in the series, but always fresh thanks to the rotation of the protagonist from one book to the next. I enjoyed this as much as any of the others… just the right blend of realism without being agonizingly heartbreaking in the manner of some previous volumes. "
"Superbly written, it is a detailed 1st person story of a murder investigation by a female detective trying to do her job and still survive working in an all-male detective division. Great detail and data accumulation results in uncovering the murderer, an accomplished and senior professional. It is an excellent read which is to be expected from this amazing author."
"4.5 stars. This is a re-read for me and it holds up the second time around. The character development in all TF books is so good. I love that the “whodunnit” part is a slow reveal rather than a big climatic surprise. Everything unfolds much like I would imagine it would in real life (although maybe still a bit more sped up). This is a long one, but totally worth it. "
"This is the last of the series. I really enjoyed the series, but this last book was my least favorite of the six. The tone of this one is a pervasive paranoia, and it left me exhausted. I think that was the intent, so we would feel what Antoinette felt, but I didn't enjoy the feeling. The story is good, as always with French, and I would highly recommend the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"Started reading this, realized I was reading the series out of order and put it down to finish the other book. When I did, I couldn't put this one down. Read it in about two sittings. Always love the settings of these books and the mystery always draws me in without fail. This one in particular kept me guessing right until the end. "
"good mystery

will keep you guessing but drags a little in the middle. Interesting charactors. I can't help wondering, did St Patrick drive all the commas out of Ireland along with the snakes? This author will write a long list of names, places, flora and fauna while adding an and in between each one instead of a cooma. Does she get paid by the word?"
"The Trespasser, by Tana French is another good police procedural with interesting characters and plot, believable characters and locations, and plenty of twists.

Honestly, I began reading Tana French’s police novels because I don’t have to wait for them in Libby, but continue reading them because they’re interesting. They’re page turners, all of them so far."
"Same detectives as the last book, but the other is the narrator. Can this sled-doubting, rejected, bitter woman really be the kick-butt couldn’t-care-less hot shot from the last novel? The inside voice will let you know.
The case is a slam dunk domestic, except it isn’t. Why was the victim so interested in gangs? Why did Conway recognize her? How creepy is too creepy?"
What a way to finish the Dublin Murder Squad. I really love Conway and Moran - The Secret Place is along with The Likeness my favourite in this series so reading about their dynamic again was great. This is such a comfort series for me and if this book is after all the last we see of the squad I'm glad it ended in such a hopeful place.
"Good, solid murder mystery. I love that I couldn't solve it, and every time I thought I was heading in the right direction, it would shift again. The main character is tough and paranoid, and being caught up in her mind and personality keeps you on your toes. I love her relationship with her partner, and I enjoyed the snapshot of life behind the scenes on a murder squad."
"Reading this book is rather like identifying with a bloodhound! I liked this one considerably better than the previous Dublin Murder Squad book. I realize (yeah, slow to the uptake!) that French enjoys painting a portrait of the foibles of her protagonists as much as she enjoys building the mysteries, crimes, and problems they solve."
I think this was my favorite in the Dublin Murder squad series!I loved being inside Detective Conway's head. I found myself getting wrapped up in her paranoia and not knowing what to believe up until the end! If you like a slow burn mystery or police procedurals with excellent character development check this one out! Tana French is a stellar mystery writer!🕵️‍♀️
Good detective story set in Dublin. The main characters are well developed with all the flaws and weaknesses. This is part of a series of books about what is coined the Murder Squad. I enjoyed the lead detective as she struggled with finding her place (And some respect) in the mostly male and Caucasian workplace. She is a force to be reckoned with.
"Another great Tana French murder mystery. Some say this is her best yet, and although I liked it, I still think The Likeness is a better book. But I did enjoy the plot twists in this book that I didn't expect, and the description of police procedure is top-notch as always. French's use of dialogue is just as good as ever, and the ending was a surprise."
"Another page turner from Tana French! The Dublin Murder Squad books always deliver. I love how they are as much about the character of the detectives and their foibles, as about the murder. This one especially had me spellbound. I love how even Antoinette can’t tell what is real at different points. I couldn’t put it down ❤️"
"I love Tana French but this one felt slower than the rest. I was missing the character depth in Conway and Moran. I liked that they continued over from The Secret Place, but neither of them had much character development. However, as always, I didn’t know where it was going, the dialogue and back and forth between theories kept me entertained and on my toes. It was neatly wrapped up in the end which was nice, I don’t have any lingering questions or confusions. "
"This was my first Tana French book and I’m excited to read more! It wasn’t the most shocking murder mystery, but it certainly had lots of twists and was an enticing read. This also might have been the first murder mystery book I’ve read from the perspective of a detective, and I thought that was a cool point of view, especially given the dynamic between everyone on the squad. "
"Out of all the main characters in this series, Conway may not be my favorite. I didn't like her much in The Secret Place but I do like her better here now when she apologized to Stephen after jumping to a whole lot of conclusions.

I liked the case here better than Secret Place but I liked how the case was solved in there compared to this one."
"Ah, a good ""who done it"" to clear the air and get the blood flowing! The conclusion gets a bit long- winded and could have used some editing. Nonetheless, The Trespasser is a satisfying entertainment. Be sure to also read Faithful Place."

Publishers Summary
Antoinette Conway, the tough, abrasive detective from The Secret Place, is still on the Murder squad, but only just.

She's partnered up with Stephen Moran now, and that's going well - but the rest of her working life isn't.
Antoinette doesn't play well with others, and there's a vicious running campaign in the squad to get rid of her. She and Stephen pull a case that at first looks like a slam-dunk lovers' tiff, but gradually they realise there's more going on: someone on their own squad is trying to push them towards the obvious solution, away from nagging questions. They have to work out whether this is just an escalation in the drive to get rid of her-or whether there's something deeper and darker going on.

Review
Conway and Moran catch the call for a case that at first glance appears to be a straightforward act of domestic violence gone bad.
The victim is Aislinn Murray, picture perfect even in death, so pretty that Conway likens her to “dead Barbie”.
As she takes a long look at her face, Conway has the strange feeling that she has met Aislinn, that she had asked for Conway's help, but capturing that memory proved elusive, she filed it away in her head to examine later.

Everything in Aislinn’s perfect little cottage seemed to set up for an intimate dinner for two, table set, food in the oven, vegetables prepared. Her phone messages to her friend confirmed that yes, she was expecting a guest who, of course, was nowhere in sight.
Two little details caused Conway and Moran to believe it may be more than the result of a domestic argument gone awry. There were indicators that the scene had been altered, someone had gone to the trouble of thoroughly cleansing the cottage, and they had even turned off the oven at the main power point for no obvious reason. Nobody does that.

When they speak to Lucy, Aislinn’s girlfriend, she responds in a manner which doesn’t really match the circumstances, so that is a bit weird too.

They visit Rory, the expected dinner guest, who, because of the circumstances plus his social ineptitude, more or less sets himself up as prime suspect.

This looks like it might turn in to their very first juicy, proper murder case. Conway and Moran are at the bottom of the pecking order as far as case allocation goes, so Conway can’t help but think of this as being the long awaited big break.
However, here’s the rub, as backup they have been allocated Detective Breslin, a smooth operator with whom Conway has issues. Her fear is that Breslin will take over, strangely, he doesn’t, instead, he is oddly helpful at first. It soon becomes obvious though that he wants to nail Rory for the murder in spite of the reservations held by Conway and Moran.
Soon Conway is discovering/imaging all the ways in which Breslin is manipulating her. Moran is the voice of reason, so reasonable in fact that Conway isn’t so sure about him either.

Now anyone who has read the series so far will know that while the author might well be providing clues for the reader, like a good mystery writer should, she is also, in many little ways, leading us up the garden path, this makes for an enjoyable and challenging mystery.

What I did not enjoy so much:
Conway is the ubiquitous damaged cop, a character much loved by many but the concept is wearing a bit thin for me. My goodness though, she is horrible. She sure lets us know that she is one angry woman! Nasty and vindictive with it, she tells us that as a kid she held her temper until the offending child was well within sights before she unleashed her vengeance upon them. This is her way.
Blame for her personality is heaped upon her mother for 1: bearing a mixed race child (Conway) and 2: making up stories about the father she never knew.
Then when she joined the Dublin Murder Squad they all hated her because she was a woman; she was not pure white in colour and, when a colleague slapped her bum she physically injured him. They played dirty tricks on her and did all they could to edge her out. The sort of behaviour that, in truth, hasn't been witnessed in the police force since the 1960s. Still, I have to remember, this IS fiction.

I got a bit tired of her endlessly baying her troubles to the moon but I must say, her large vocabulary enabled her to do so in the most poetic of ways-with her way with words she ought really to have been a writer.
(I have to say though that towards the end of the book she does seem to be waking up to and recognising her awful ways).

Conway prides herself on her interview techniques, choosing from an array of personas to match the interviewee, I think a bit more “cool girl” in the squad room might have saved her from plenty of the grief dished out by her colleagues.
As if those interrogation scenes weren’t endless enough then the rehash of every word said, every nuance noticed and every thought ever thunk must surely be enough to satisfy the greediest of word gobblers.

To sum up:
A great story and engaging mystery that took too long to tell, its the engaging mystery and satisfying ending that earns this book 4 stars.

Review copy provided by Hachette Australia - thanks."
"I really liked this book. I listened to the audible version and it was awesome - the women reading and her lovely Irish brogue. Very good mystery with some very strong characters and insights to be a detective, Also the camaraderie and loyalty of cops. "
"Yet again, Tana French got me fully invested in a character I was previously hesitant about, all while crafting a murder mystery that had me hooked until the end. There's a reason why she's one of the best in her genre, and I'm so glad to have made my way through this series."
"Definitely one of her better ones, firmly grounded in reality with no paranormal stuff that seeped into one or two of her others and weakened the overall detective story, in my opinion (I've read them all and have trouble remembering which was which!). Can't wait for her next one!"
Enjoyed the book and really liked the character interaction between of Conway & Moran the mystery itself wasn't one of her best and felt a little dragged out to get to the ultimate conclusion which had been reached easily a 100 pages before the book concluded 
"I liked and enjoyed this book, but thought it sometimes had a bit with too much detail. There were times when it actually dragged some. With that said, I could hardly put it down and endured the overwriting to get to the conclusion."
It did take a while to get into this book which I found annoying. The writing just wasn't catching me and I had to keep rereading passages. Eventually it did get better and I was curious how it would end. Solid book. 
"I love Antoinette Conway. I just do. This is her second appearance in Tana French's series and it is written from her point of view. I could not be happier with that because what Tana French does best is grasping personalities and giving them life and character. Antoinette Conway is one of her best characters yet.

As for the story - as always it is amazing how INSANELY entertaining a bunch of interrogations become in Tana French's hands. Yet, Stephen Moran and Conway get pointlessly sidetracked in this one and it does not always make sense. When they do unearth a mystery, however, it gets all the more entertaining. If you like police work a little more realistic - with all its misleads and dead ends, this is your novel of choice. Of course, as is Tana French's recipe, the Dublin murder squad gets personally involved somehow in this one again.

The Trespasser does not beat the characterization and writing of the previous novel (The Secret Place), but it's got all the joy and skill of a Tana French novel, indeed. It still beats most other writers of the genre, just not her previous self, which is a high bar to reach. A great read with awesome characters, give it a try.

A note on the audiobook: It's awesome. I'm rarely this happy with a speaker, and that's not just because I like the Irish accent. Hilda Fay is GREAT at breathing life into the different characters so they perfectly suit the way in which they were written. I'm impressed!"
"The latest entry in the series, The Trespasser plays out slower, trading in the last minute twists and surprises for an ending that slowly works up on you. Although the ending can be seen a mile away, it doesn't take away from it, instead making it so much better."
I loved this book. I love the author's attention to detail. I know some find the pace is slow but I don't - it's very police procedural which I enjoy. And I liked Conway and Moran more in this book than the last. So I've read them all dammit. What now??
"Back at it with Conway and Moran, who I loved in The Secret Place. A whole lot of equally plausible murder scenarios, drama around Conway's outsider status on the squad, and delicious Irish slang (made better by the audiobook, read by a highly animated and accented voice actor)."
Quite good. Ends well after a rather slow beginning- too much time is spent on the lead woman detective's anger and suspicions. She's always a bit too one dimensional anyway. What the book really is about are the stories we tell each other - and the consequences when we start to believe them.
"I liked this one, but I liked these particular protagonists, before, too. I found it different, and interesting, that this book took place mostly in the squad, even in the detective's head, more than out and about at the crime scene, investigating in the field, woods, the past, whatever."
"I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book. When a story is read by someone with appropriate accent it makes the story so much more powerful, in my opinion. I will definitely try another of the Dublin Murder Series by Tana French. "
"My favorite of the 3 Tana French books I have read. The narration was excellent, the descriptions allowed me to picture the various settings which often were important in describing a character and the plot kept me interested."
"Tana's books are always un-put-downable. The main character in this book (our first-person viewpoint) is a cranky bitch for a lot of the book, but actually grows into an adult at the end, so that was satisfying. And while the murderer seemed unlikely at first, in the end it made perfect sense."
"Three and a half stars - half a star lost for unnecessary use of expletives and some frankly boring, continual introspection from Antoinette.
The plot was good and well-paced and it was a good holiday read, but if this is a representative novel, I'm not her biggest fan!"
A nicely done mystery with a twist I genuinely did not see coming. The main character got a bit on my nerves with her over the top chip on her shoulder but it didn't seriously detract from the slowly untangling mystery ( or really mysteries)
"The Trespasser made me want to return to the rest of Tana French's body of work, because her books are always gripping and wonderfully written. Antoinette is perhaps one of her most interesting protagonists yet. "
A solid police procedural with a struggling female detective with a chip on her shoulder. A bit sloggy at times but generally encourages pursuit of the conclusion. I will likely try another in this series.
"I'm reading Ms French's novels out of order just because the latest was on the new book shelf at my library. I didn't like the character of Antoinette Conway at first, but something made me sympathetic to her by mid-book. Good story and a well-done twist."
"This murder mystery gripped me from beginning to end !!! Full of witty humour and plot twists, Tana French really captured the perfect level of suspense needed for a brilliant crime book. I am very excited to purchase the rest of the Dublin Murder Squad series!"
"The usual gripe I have with Tana French's depiction of male characters - they are usually either whiny super-sensitives, or locker-room jock types who are depicted as crude brutish neanderthals. However, still a very enjoyable 4-star story, and I keep looking out for her next book."
"I really enjoyed this book, as I have her previous ones. I have missed 2 and I will find them and read them. Love her characters and plot. It is a mystery, but it is also a nice novel on its own. If you want a quick cozy mystery, this is not it. "
"Far more of a procedural than French's other books, and Antoinette wasn't nearly as strung out and emotionally devastated as TF's usual detectives, so I wasn't as engaged, but this is still better than 98% of the mystery/thrillers out there. "
"I love Antoinette Conway so much, and Stephen Moran is still as charming as ever. Even though I did see the ending coming, I still thought this was a perfectly paced mystery with amazing characterization. I honestly think Tana French can do no wrong."
"This sort of started out slow, but it sucked me in quickly, just like all of her books! So many red herrings--it forced me to keep reading, and then I couldn´t stop! My favorite is still The Secret Place, but I have to say, this one was worth the wait. Can wait for more. :)"
"Tana French is a master of the detective novel. With a vivid sense of time and place, well-developed characters, and twists and turns along the way, she rates as one of the very best. This novel didn't disappoint. "
"This works as a stand-alone book as the detectives in Murder Squad do not all move from one tale to the next. In this book, we follow a female lead detective as she unravels a case that may or may not implicate someone on the very squad where she struggles to get along. French does a nice job taking you through the police procedural while providing enough personal backstory to keep the characters interesting. "
"Always a huge fan of French but I felt that the book was more convoluted than it really needed to be. However, as usual, the twist and turns were well seeded and made sense to the story even though I didn't see it coming"
"The latest from one of my favorite mystery/crime authors. It's like a Nancy Drew mystery to keep you guessing, with a dash of Law & Order police procedural, a sprinkle of Jane Austen hidden motivations and set in Dublin which is the literary equivalent of a pint of Guinness. Recommend. "
"Usually Tana French is my absolute favorite, and I was excited to finally have a female detective again. However, this one dragged a little bit for (those interrogation scenes seemed to last for days) and Antoinette was a little too critical/paranoid, even with everything that happened."
"I had a hard time liking the lead detective in this one, but the story was interesting. The partnership between the two detectives and the friction with the rest of the squad was intriguing. Overall a good mystery. "
"Slow going and depressing at first. But things pick up rather quickly with lots of twists and turns. The Trespasser is a vivid description of detectives in Dublin investigating a murder, and no one appears to be a hero. "
Sometimes I just need a good mystery and Tana French always delivers. This one is one of the best in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I wasn't sure who did it until the end and all the pieces came together and the scenario was more believable than some of the other books. 
"I really like this whole series and Tana French does such a great job at the character development in this one. The plot is great, as usual, but now we get more of a read on the edgy female detective and get paranoid right with her. Recommend not just to mystery lovers but all readers of fiction"
"Very satisfying ending, and remained suspenseful right to the end because even though you know who did it, you don't know how, or if, justice will be served.What does the title mean? Forgive those who trespass against us?More coming...."
Liked this one a lot better than the last one (The Secret Place). This has the same detectives (Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran) but this time told from Conway's voice. I liked the dynamic between the two of them. 
"The audio version is fantastic, but the book is fantastic as well. The writing surpassed my expectations as did the character development. I found this to be a real page turner. I would love to read more by the same author."
GREAT read. Luscious insight into people and relationships with exquisite character development and twisty plot turns. Classic Tana French. I highly recommend the while series of Dublin Murder Squad books.
"I didn't realize when I read this that it was part of a series. That being said, I was not lost at all while reading it. An interesting murder mystery that takes place in Ireland. I actually did an audio book for this and it was great because the reader had an Irish accent. Enjoyable book."
"Police procedurals are not usually my favorite type of crime novel, but this won me over as it is also an incredibly insightful book in terms of the psychology of the characters. I would definitely read more in this series."
this is a great story following a murder squad detective in Dublin. there were some interesting twists and turns that made this a good read. Recommend as a solid murder mystery read for when you want to escape to Ireland.
I've finally caught up with reading all the Dublin Murder Squad books. This one did not disappoint. Interesting characters and murder. Now I have to wait until the next one comes out. No more finding them on the shelf at the library.
"I enjoyed this installment of the Tana French Dublin Murder Squad novels, even though I didn't always love the main character (I found the everyone is out to get me theory a bit too much) and I guessed the overall twist fairly early on. "
"Quite a reach for the 4th star. I like Conway as a main character, I just didn't think this situation was as intriguing as the first three books in the series--a feeling I have been chasing with the last three. "
"This is only the second Tana French book I read, but I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of the books so far, so I'll probably read all of them!

"Now that I’ve read all of the Tana French Dublin Murder squad books, I feel like I’m qualified to rank them.

#1 - The Likeness
#2- In the Woods
#3 - Broken Harbor
#4 - The Secret Place
#5 - Faithful Place
#6 - The Trespasser
"
"At the beginning I wasn't caring for the story or, especially, the characters. Then, just before I almost quit reading, it caught me and then I enjoyed quite a bit. A different plot and it makes you think. "
Well written who done it starring a hardened female detective on the murder squad. She can't remember how she knows he victim of the case she's supposed to solve. She thinks all the men on her squad want her gone. Lots of twists. Love the audio vs. 
"This was a great listen for my driving days. And then I couldn't stop, so I'd sit in the car, and then take it into the house with me listening! Very good. I would have given it five stars if the ending didn't seem to drag out a bit. Highly recommend. "
"The only reason this isn't five stars is because Antoinette annoyed the crap out of me half the book. I know that's the point, she's a likeable, unlikeable character. Another good page turner from French."
"More than a mystery

This was a mystery book unlike any I've ever read. It's not thrilling because you need to find out how it happens, but because of how the characters psychologically process what happened. Hard to put down!"
Fans of the series get another look at the partnership of Conway and Moran with this one. Someone is playing games with Conway when she and Moran try to solve what should be a simple case. Excellent.
Not so much a whodunnit but whydunnit. Really great at getting in most characters' heads with a believably flawed heroine. A bit overlong for as little plot you get but it's always a pleasure to read French's dialogue. She gets better and better each time.
It took me awhile to read this book. Even when I started it was slow for me. Towards the end it started to pick up and I enjoyed it. I would have liked more in the ending but I think this is a series so hopefully the next book explains. 
"Like all of French’s books, The Trespasser tells a twisty turny story of a murder in Dublin. I thought this was one of the more interesting books - I liked that the narrator was a woman. I really enjoyed the mystery here. "
"Loved this, not that anyone’s surprised. I was so excited to find this newest installment at my local library. I started this series last month and have now read all 6. I’m so sad to see it end. Fingers crossed she rights another one! I can’t get enough of the Dublin Murder Squad"
Took me longer to read than usual with the Irish slang. Gaff is a house and Gaffer is the boss—confusing. The main character was so bitter and tough that at times it was difficult to read. I was glad to see that she softened in the end—not too much and that kept it real. 
"Didn't see this coming, just like Antoinette and Steve, didn't think it or want to believe it. Nice call having Antoinette think the whole murder squad was against her--she took it a little too far but got back on track. Lots of theories sounding plausible throughout."
"I listened to this book on CD, and the narrator was phenomenal. I can’t tell you how much her narration added to the story-her accents and characterizations were truly amazing. I liked the book, but I loved the narrator!"
"First of this series that I've read - so no opinions on first books of the series. Good story in general -- some parts fairly unbelievable and other parts not really resolved, but maybe they didn't need to be in the end. Learned a lot of Irish slang!"
"The Dublin Murder Squad is one of my favorite series. Tana French incorporates all the members of the squad in different setting and situations. A must read for fans of Irish writers and fans of the intracacy of Irish pysche.
"
I'm sad that I've finally finished all the Dublin Murder Squad books by Tana French. All I can do now is wait until she finishes another one. I'm hoping the next book will feature Fleas - Antoinette Conway's undercover buddy. (Please not Breslin!)
"Didn't want to like it after my disappointment in The Hypnotist, by Lars Kepler, but found myself enjoying the spunk of the female Detective Antoinette Conway. Enjoyed the banter between Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran. Next will try Into the Woods!"
"4.25/5 stars. An excellent addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series. The characters made this book, especially Conway and Moran, but they were all solid and written with depth and complexity. I look forward to reading the next one."
"The story pulls you in to the life of a female detective in an all male murder squad. The Irish sland can be a bit hard to understand, but you can figure it out. Sometimes a bit trite with the stereotypes and a complex story line. A really good read!"
"Tana French consistently writes excellent fiction to a point where if I see her name and on a cover, I will pick it up. French’s latest novel, The Trespasser, does not disappoint and is another solid installment to the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"I will be so sad if this is truly the last of the Dublin Murder Squad series, though it feels very much like a conclusion. I’m in love with this series. It offers a fun “whodunnit” but is also beautifully written and always so much more than just the murder. "
"Good read

This is the Tana French book I have read. I am looking forward to the next one. It's a good detective book and just when I thought I knew the outcome, it took a turn. Page turner!!!"
"This is the second book of hers that I've read, and I'm hooked. Full of plot twists, interesting characters, and beautiful writing. As a bonus, the audio book narrator was great (although it took me a while to adjust to her thick Dublin accent)."
Really enjoyed writing this book. Even got up early to finish it to know how it ended. Very involved. Tons of dialogue. Characters were excellent. Story line very detailed but kept my mind working. First time reader of her work. Looking forward to reading other books by author
"Really enjoyed this entire series. This book I liked a little less than some of the other books in the series, only because I didn't get into the characters (specifically the detectives) in this book. Still fantastic writing. Love this author and would recommend this book. "
"What I liked most was the first person perspective from a narrator who, as a female, had to deal with a lot of sexist crap in her work as a police officer in the ""Murder Squad"" and how that affected her thought process on the case you was working on.

The audiobook narrator did a good job."
"I always enjoy her stuff. Fast paced and well plotted, although it would still be good about 50 pages lighter. As always, more if a character study then a who done it, and the characters were great, not cliches and characters learn and grow. Good summer read."
"A return to form from Tana French. This was an excellent read - still not quite as good as books 1 and 2 in the series, but close. The twists and turns were good from a plot point of view and the characterisation strong. "
"I loved all the unpredictable suspense that this book had to offer, however, I'm only rating this book 4star just because Antoinette and her partner Stephan worked so hard on a case and they didn't even get any credit for there hard work. "
"I started this one a while ago and didn't really get drawn in. But, second time was a charm. The protagonist is an complex, appealing character. And the setting of the Dublin murder squad and all its politics is engaging. Oh, and, it's a great mystery, much deeper than it first appears."
"Excellent story, very well told. It's fascinating and credible how the characters' relationships change and change again. My only complaint is that Conway, the main character, is so totally negative and angry about everything."
"Wieder sehr spannend und doch nicht mein absoluter Liebling aus der Reihe, dafür war es mir dieses Mal einen Tick zu viel Spekulation und Hin und Her zwischen den Ermittlern, trotzdem klare Leseempfehlung"
"I may not have liked Antoinette Conway, Tana French's protagonist in this book in her Dublin Murder Squad series, but French's terrific storyline, complex characters, and interesting twists kept me entranced. In fact, I think this and The Likeness are the best in the entire series!"
"I’m a big fan of the Dublin Murder Squad series, so I suspect that it was nearly a foregone conclusion that I would enjoy The Trespasser. In part, the book succeeds because a preceding volume has laid down a strong foundation for it (as often happens in the series). Antoinette Conway is an indelible character, both admirable and abrasive. She’s embattled and defensive, but also frank and self-aware. So, even as the central murder case gets off to a measured start, we have an entertaining, well-penned protagonist to carry us along.

Yet the action intensifies in the final third, with an especially suspenseful denouement. The Trespasser keeps the Dublin series in fine form and I hope we see more of Antoinette."
"I have read every Tana French book. The characters all have secrets that make them memorable. My favorite is still her first, Into the Woods with its lack of resolution but they are always well written and better than the works of just about any other writer in this genre. "
"A little slow and too much police procedural stuff. I did not enjoy the. Ann character being so suspicious of being bullied. That said, I still enjoyed the story and the mystery. It was interesting to find out whodunnit and also enjoyable to watch the detectives solve the mystery. "
"Thought it was a good mystery. Had LOTS of twists and turns and ""red herrings"" -- sometimes I thought it dragged out a bit, but most detective and police work doesn't happen in a 30/60minute time frame like you see on TV. Kept my interest - kept me listening. Liked the resolution."
"Maybe not my favorite @TanaFrench book, but might be the most twisting, turning, pull-the-rug-out-from-under-you case I've read by her. Still prefer In the Woods, but this one kept me hooked without figuring it out until the hammer came down at the end. Recommended!"
"Another great plot from Tana French. Great character development and good twists to keep you going. She doesn't disappoint. I also enjoy the banter, expressions and location of the stories. Will go on to #7 in the series for sure. "
"I wasn't crazy about the story but the characters, writing and page-turner factor were all there for me. Tana French is so good at this genre and this series, I hope the Dublin Murder Squad never runs out of Ds to explore."
"This was my first Tana French novel, and I would definitely read more of them. The novel was made even better by the audio reading by Hilda Fay, with her lovely accent. I will definitely be looking to read earlier books in the series."
These books are addicting. This one was missing the touch of supernatural. The POV is wounded and paranoid and that made the book tougher to read because it is not comfortable to be in Conway’s skin. 
"If this is going to be the last book in this series then it's a good one to go out on. Slightly too intense being in Conway's brain some of the time, with double and triple thinking things but the ending paid off."
"3.75 stars (if that’s possible haha) This was a big book, and at some points felt a little repetitive, but I never lost interest. An easy read, and I liked that I didn’t know how it was going to wrap up until the very end. "
"Superbly written. Dialogue is the best ... as in the other books of hers I've read. Lots of twists and unexpected turns. However, a bit overlong. Perhaps 25% shorter would have been ideal (at least for me). "
"I’ve discovered a new favorite author for mystery
writing in Tana French. I recently read the Witch Elm and really liked it. This one was even better. Her characters are personality rich and so dynamic. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this one and can’t wait to read another one."
Great police procedural. Unfortunately it’s the last in the series and the first I’ve read so I did that out of order. But I never felt lost without the background. I’ll get around to the previous novels eventually. 
"Napinavá detektivka. Hlavní hrdinka mi byla velmi sympatická, což jsou hned body navíc. Autorka zde rozehrála příběh, kde postupným rozkrýváním zjišťujete, že nic není tak, jak by se na první pohled mohlo zdát a to je přesně podle mého gusta."
I enjoyed this book. I have read many other Tana French books before and liked then. This book started off very slow in my opinion and about half way through picked up. The ending was not what expected and enjoyed it.
"I enjoyed the Dublin dialect quite a bit (my grandmother was born in Ireland and I so loved listening to her talk). I enjoyed the complicated plot. However, I thought it went on much too long. I'll try another of her books because I love the pictures she paints."
"3.5 stars. I typically enjoy Tana French's writing and this was no different. Solid read with enough twists and interesting characters to keep things engaging. Not an overly memorable book, but I definitely enjoyed it. "
"Waaay too long. Remove about 150 pages, and I will be thrilled by the story. Female detective is appropriately flawed in a man-centered department, yet she carries on finding the right perpetrator, and not settling for the most convenient target. Good on her!"
"I liked this, although the protagonist lacked self-awareness at times, which I found frustrating. There were some twists that I didn’t see coming and a bunch that I did. I would try the author again. "
"Like other Tana French books, she takes you into the challenges and foibles not only of the criminals but also the detectives. The parallel challenges running in this book were intelligent and provocative and the mystery gripping. Highly recommend."
"I greatly enjoy this series and this book is no exceptions. I wish I knew more about Dublin as some of the geographical references are lost on me,

Even once the squad figures out who the murderer is, it is not clear how they can prove it and get justice for victim."
"This was a solid police procedural, I liked the first 2 in this series then it went a bit downhill for me but this one had me coming back to a higher enjoyment level. I had the bit mystery figured early but I enjoyed the solve and the resolution."
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries, especially the rapport between Conway and Moran. I feel, though, that the books could be edited down about 100 pages. The stories are so drawn out that the solutions don’t pack as much of a punch as they could. "
"Very readable and absorbing, like all French's novels. French chose a strong female for the main narrator this time, who with her young male partner, made the squad dynamics and case twists unique. "
"really like this one, except the premise is a bit gross (and kinda unbelievable like the Likeness)
I can see why Conway rubs people (and some readers) the wrong way, but in a way it's kind of understandable."
"I had a hard time at the beginning of the book getting interested. As the story moved on, it got more interesting.
Aislin's murder and the detectives trying to solve it told a story of intrigue, cheating and friendship.
I always like the Irish stories and this one was really good."
"Much better than The Secret Place. It abandons the absurd premises and magical realism, and gets back to the stuff (character development, self discovery, relationships amongst the detectives) that sucked me into this series in the first place. "
I almost gave up on this book several times within the first 150 pages but I stuck it out and I’m glad I did. It’s very gritty and seems fairly realistic of a police investigation. I ended up really enjoying it!
"My first time with this author. I was a little put off by Harriet always whining about herself and putting herself and no one appreciating her. However, I enjoyed the two main stories and intertwining plots. Kept me going through to end. Overall I liked it a lot. "
"Took awhile to get into this book. Loaded with Irish slang that I struggled to understand.

Just when I thought I’d figured out the killer, there was yet another theory. In that respect, the story was good. But I felt like the end was rushed while the middle was stretched out too long."
"I really liked the book, as I’ve liked the previous Dublin Murder Squad books as well, although I wasn’t overly fond of the main character. That said, it didn’t detract from the story or the writing. Solid 4/5"
"Really, 4.5 stars. It was really good, compelling characters and plots, like all of Tana French’s work. I found myself wanting her to break her pattern and write more books with Conway and Moran, instead of moving to a new detective. But of all her books, I still like The Likeness best. "
"Intriguing

Realistic and gritty- if you like detective stories, this book is for you. It’s a page turner that will change your convictions about “who-done-it” the entire time. I plan to read more of Ms. French’s books."
"Like so many, I love Tana French police procedurals, and this was no exception. I thought the middle section dragged a bit, hence only 4 start, but the final 150 pages were dynamite--I didn't want to stop reading. "
"I enjoyed hearing the story of a tough female cop having to look into possible illegal activity in her squad. The lead character was vulnerable and tough while she went through an investigation learning about herself, her values, and her judgement of those around her."
"Excellent crime thriller!!! It had so many twists I got whiplash! I recommend reading this book after The Secret Place, in the series sequence since it has the same 2 characters. Although having Antoinette as the main left my head hurting at times. Loved the book!"
"I borrowed this book from a friend and even though I haven't read the rest of the series, I really enjoyed it. I liked the writing, but the most interesting thing was the French's description of power dynamics in the workplace and in terms of gender. "
"I really liked this one. It takes place in Ireland which means instant attraction! I loved the audio recording, and it really kept my interest. I’ll read (listen to) the rest of the series for sure. I should have started with the first one though!"
"Good Story

This is the first book i read.out of this series. I thought it was a good story and I like the characters. I don't usually read mystery but this one kept !y interest. I plan to read more of this series."
"I love this author. She has a wonderful writing style and great psychological insight. I have read two of her books, and the only comment I have is that they seem to go on a bit long. But the premise and characters are marvelous."
"A Slow Percolating Police Procedural

This murder mystery begins slowly and sorts through many clues and red herrings on it’s journey to solving the crime. Be patient, like all Tana French novels, “The Trespasser” is another great who-done it."
Rounding up from a 3.5 star rating because French does a better job at character development and adding some meat to a police procedural than most. This is the sixth of the author’s Dublin murder squad series
A long read but worth every minute. Very well written. Impossible to like Conway but impossible to not admire her tenacity and eventual willingness to look at herself with acceptance. This book goes beyond solving a murder; kudos to French for all the insights.
"Really a 3.5 star book but I rounded up in deference to French’s reputation and also because I liked how it ended. Otherwise, there were so many threads running here and I thought the book was too long. But I liked the ending. "
"Incredibly written. Enjoyed this so much. The reader of the audiobook, Hilda Fay, is fantastic. Listening to it in the car I had plenty of time to come up with theories about how it would unfold and as usual I wasn’t even close! "
"I was honestly surprised by this book - the ending really got me. It was a good read, French does a great job writing up murder mysteries. The story keeps you going, keeps you focused on trying to figure out what exactly happens. It was a real page turner towards the end!"
"A Good who done it!

Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are still the newbies on the Murder squad. They get thrown a case, along with a veteran to help them out. When they figure out what happened it’s a nightmare and it will make or break them. A Good Read!"
"I thought this book was well written and overall a really good story. There were plenty of twists and turns. I had a difficult time relating to the main character, but some of the others made up for that. "
"French has an incredible ability to create characters, situations and dialogue. The resolution of the plot wasn't a total surprise, but watching it unfold was a joy. Four stars is an excellent rating from me as I reserve five stars for the books of take to the proverbial desert island."
Tana writing is a level above most mystery writers and I love her treatment of both male and female characters. Her plots are unusual and engaging. One of the few authors where I've read all their books. I usually get bored with the same voice.
"Detective murder mystery

If you like watching cop shows, you will probably enjoy this novel. I didn’t find Antoinette’s reactions to be totally believable in all situations, but in general, the book was good for an escape."
I liked it - a good whodunnit mystery featuring good cops and bad cops and good detective work. I didn’t know it was part of a series until I was half done but decided to read it through anyways... I am glad I did. 
"I am definitely a Tana French fan.

Her books are long, and twisty, and since they are stand alone even in a series, when I can't get the next one, I can read one later in the series, which is nice."
Murder Squad's Antoinette and Steve investigate the death of Aislinn Murphy. They are getting pressure to arrest Aislinn's boyfriend but they continue to discover things that indicate things are not as simple as they seem. Good thriller but a bit too long.
"I expected this police procedural to be better based on _The Witch Elm_, which was really clever and well written. Instead, this novel was fairly good in a predictable way. The ending isn’t surprising but the characters are interesting enough to carry you along for a pleasant ride."
"I am a big fan of this series. I hope that there will be additional books in the future. Although each book can be read without having read the prior books, I do recommend reading them in order. This book seemed to rely less on the back stories of the individuals so, if you pick The Trespasser up to read, you won't be confused by relationships between the squad members."
"this is a great example of good crime fiction. long, windy chapters on key police procedures with a delightful Irish setting (and lingo!), and a dramatic plot- unfolding into a logical, tragic conclusion. i love French's prose, she has an eye for detail and structure. "
"Tana French has written a number of unusually intelligent mystery stories, & this one is no exception.
A ""police procedural,"" where the focus of the story is more on the the ""procedural"" than on the crime."
"Just so so good!

I love it when a book makes me think about who the suspect is. It did have some things that threw me back to Broken Harbor.

And I do believe BH is the superior book. But I really enjoyed our main character."
"Now that I have finished the whole series of six books, I can say that I truly have a love/hate relationship with the series and maybe even the author. Fortunately, this is one of the better books in the series. In fact, maybe the best. "
My only complaint about this book is the first half is slow but I’m glad I didn’t give up on it. After I got into the second half I couldn’t put it down. This is the last Murder Squad book that Tana French has published but I’m hoping there will be more. 
"I love Irish accents. This strong female lead is temperamental and a bit paranoid. I loved the book-lots of details. There was no major dramatic ending-however-it was a good ending and well explained...I didn’t feel like I was cut off too early.
"
"I'd give this one 4 stars. It was tough in the beginning because of the ""language barrier"". The story takes place in Dublin and the words were a bit weird at first. Overall though, I liked the story. It kept me guessing until the end."
"Неплохой детектив, в котором читатель вместе с детективами все время сомневается в адекватности и вероятности своих версий. Из минусов: лично меня немного отталкивает образ и манера поведения детектива Конвей. "
"Antoinette feels like an outsider in the squad, so when she is assigned an apparently straightforward murder case, her investigation is complicated by doubts about her colleagues. Great crime mystery."
"I wish I could actually give this 3.5 stars. I am a huge fan of Tana French, but this one took me a long time to finish because I had trouble getting into it. It was a really good book and she’s a great writer, so maybe that’s just a me problem. "
"Great writing and an engaging, albeit very negative, narrator. The plot itself is not all that interesting, but the writing more than makes up for it. I listened to it as an audiobook and the Irish accent alone is worth listening for!"
"While reading this book, I didn’t like it as much as the others she has written. It was slow to build. By the end I was a fan. There are depth to this book you don’t understand until you reach the end. "
I’m a big fan of French but this book was kind of disappointing. I figured out what happened about halfway through. Usually it takes me a bit longer but this one was glaring. Still a good read though. 
This book was a solid procedural complete with inter-squad angst and various scenarios. I would have liked degrading the score to a 3.5 because of excess dialogue but did not merit a 3. The prolonged ending was a bit of a letdown but over all a good read
"I have not liked all of the books in this series, but this one may be the best. Nothing wrong with a plain old murder mystery. I haven't seen the TV show yet and I am looking forward to it. I wonder who makes the cut and is in the next book."
Pager turner. Psychological crime thriller without gratuitous sex. This was my first read by author Tana French but the next two books are already on my Kindle. Once I find an intelligent author I have to read everything .
"One star is for the narrator and also the fact that this story was more enjoyable than The Secret Place. Not sure if there will be more in this series but if not, I like how it started with partners and ended with partners in this one."
"This series, the Dublin Murder Squad series, is probably my favorite detective series. Focusing on a different detective in each book and showing us glimpses of other detectives from other books in the series is a great device. "
"So many mind games in this one! I loved it. Conway is tough as nails, and the way she and her partner attack the murder case to try to prove themselves to their squad, once and for all, amid backstabbing and paranoia, is so great. "
"A twisty mystery that is intensely readable -- something that is not always the case with Tana French, as her novels tend to meander.
Antoinette was incredibly annoying and unlikeable, and I found myself wanting her to finally quit and stop being so miserable."
"Another great Dublin Murder Squad novel. I like that these books change narrators and perspective so they never get old. This time the POV is Antoinette Conway, the touchy female detective from The Secret Place. Her (justified) reasons to feel persecuted end up getting in the way of the investigation into the murder of a woman."
"This is my third Tana French book, and I’ve enjoyed every one of them. I actually had planned to read the ones published after the first two and before this one, but I just haven’t gotten to them yet. I’m glad, though, that my mystery book group selected to read this one. The unusual thing about French’s books is that she keeps some of the same characters in her books, but the main character is not the same like other mystery series. This makes it easy to pick up any of her books and not worry about the order. There is a lot of substance to this mystery, and the story is intricately plotted. French has created realistic, flawed individuals that maintain your interest and the dialogue is superb. As with many police procedurals, politics play a part, and her description of interrogation scenes is riveting. A bonus is the Dublin setting. The only complaint with this one, and it is minor, is that the book could have been a little shorter. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Hilda Fay was fabulous. I really enjoyed hearing her accent and the way she told the story. I would highly recommend listening to this one, but you can’t go wrong either way."
Has to be my favorite in the series. 4.5 or 8 out of 10. Tana has honed the interpersonal conflict in this book which is where she shines best. I truthfully do not like murder/mystery books so enjoying this series had been a shock and a delight.
Yay! A Tana French novel that I could really like again from beginning to end. Great story. Really liking her main cop character here. Most of the characters remain sympathetic which is not always the case with her novels. Definitely read this one.
"This is the third Tana French novel I've read, after the Witch Elm and In the Woods. It was more of a straightforward mystery than those two, which I liked. I did sometimes feel a little exhausted by Conway's narration and the paranoia that suffused it, but I did enjoy the character overall. "
As always I liked the book and the two partners' interactions and thoughts. I did keep getting Steve and Antoinette mixed up. She was way more paranoid and insecure than in the last book. Lots of good plot and detail with some twists and turns. Hope she writes another book in this series.
"Police procedural, squad politics, and life inside the head of the woman detective in the squad. This rang true about a woman inI the testosterone-drenched murder squad.
This one has a faster-paced plot and was less moody than the typical Tana French."
"Listened to the audiobook which was very well done. Really enjoyed this book, interesting twists and turns. Really enjoyed the internal dialogue and concerns as the story unfolds. Looking forward to finding and reading the earlier ones in this series with great interest. "
I very much enjoyed this book. The story line kept me engaged. Characters were interesting and most were developed to give me a well defined mind’s eye picture. I like the descriptions of life in Ireland and language usage specific to the area. 
"This took a LONG time for me to warm up to it. I do like Tana French but I need to be in the right mood. This one has a very prickly, impatient MC and I found her quite annoying much of the time. But a good story, good character development, really excellent audio. "
"A rock-solid police procedural with occasionally transcendent writing. No outrageous twists, but more than enough complexity to keep it engaging. One of the most grounded crime thrillers I've ever read."
Loved it! Tana French does a great job of building tension and exploring the lead characters' backstories and motivation. I wanted a little more at the finish about the fallout of the denouement - but overall loved it. 
"Another really good one in the series; VERY enjoyable, & well-written, as usual. Good plot, good characterizations; the usual Dublin Squad atmosphere came thru. Not reliant on any of the previous books. "
"I like Antoinette and Steve. Antoinette made me mad a few times, but I got over it in the end (as did she). The central mystery was interesting enough and, I suppose, something different for the squad. "
"Not my favorite book by Tana French. I really like the Dublin Murder Squad series but this one was tough to get in to. The main female character is angry and just not hard to like, hard to read. I found it got easier just past midway. I actually ended up enjoying it! "
Lots of unfamiliar dialect but then this is my first French book. I really have a like-dislike relationship with Det.Antoinette Conway. The book drags on a bit sorting her hang-ups. Will try another by this author. Really a 3.5 rating for me but then ...
"Tana French writes beautifully again and the plot was reliably gripping! Not my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book, though, as the characters were hard to sympathize with. While it might not have been my favorite of her novels, French did not let me down and I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"Like the main characters, like the writing, the case being solved is ok.

I also like the fact the story is being told from the detective's angle, which adds uncertainties to whatever she thinks or says.

Enjoyable read."
"Another great Dublin Murder Squad book! I found the beginning slow and almost quit reading it, but the middle and end made up for it. Though this was my least favorite lead of all the Murder Squad books. "
"Another instalment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. The author takes awhile to get to the resolution, but her insights about human nature along the way are well worth the dawdle. The last 100 or so pages give us the heart-breaking denouement. Beautifully written, as are all her books."
"It’s all about the characters, and Tana French has quite a few surprises here. It’s as much a book about the murder squad as it is about the specific murder, with French’s usual brilliant writing. Not fives stars because Conway’s attitude became grating after a while. Still, great read."
"Antoinette and her partner Stephen are the newbies to the Murder Squad coming off a night sihft when they ""catch"" a murder of a young woman. As usual, Ms French lays a trail with many twists, turns, deadends and finally, the blinding truth."
"""Ah Jaysus"": no more Dublin Murder Squad books to read. You may find this one uncomfortable reading at times if you've ever done burnout/near burnout, and got your head in that stressed, kinda paranoid, hyper-alert yet missing obvious things state."
"one of the quotes from critics called the book ""unputdownable"" which it was. I'll go back to brush up on technique if I ever need to interrogate anyone. Tana French spins a good story about the Dub Murder Squad"
Listened to half on Audiobook. For a while there I was really starting to get annoyed at Det Conway. She had such a big chip on her shoulder. Everyone was out to get her. But the story came back around and was tied off pretty neatly. 
"Kept Me Engrossed

This was a wonderful story. The characters and their lives became real. But, I sometimes had a difficult time following the dialog, although that may have been me. I highly recommend giving it a try!"
"
I enjoyed this book. I wasn't able to guess 'who done it'. It was driving me crazy
to the point that I wanted to check out the last two pages ..... but I didn't. It was a good
mystery. I always enjoy reading Tana French."
"Tana French does murder mystery/police procedural like butter. That’s the best way I can describe it, because it’s not my usual genre. Each book’s protagonist sucks you in, whether they’re likable or not, and the novels are close to un-put-down-able. "
Don't be scared by all the cop jargon. This one is very suspenseful with lots of twists and turns. Seems realistic as to what detectives actually go through to solve a case. Really kept my interest.
"Dublin Murder Squad does it again!

I just love Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad. This one had a slow build up, but did not disappoint in the end! I just hope this isn’t the end of line for the Squad!"
"Better than some of the others in the series - or at least more of a plausible, concrete plot than teenagers mind-controlling poltergeists in their boarding school. A solid police procedural and yes still some of the maddening loops to nowhere that French is famous for."
"Extremely satisfying and excellently read. Antoinette is a complex, frustrating, and realistic character. Hilda Fay does an excellent job of the narration. This is probably my second-favorite Tana French novel, after The Likeness."
"I loved and hated this book. Loved it because this series is fantastic; hated it because it is the last in the series! So far anyway!
Stephen and Antoinette, detectives from the last book, get handed a run of the mill domestic murder. Simple, or is it?????
Great twists and turns and a closer look at Antoinette’s life and her problems with her co workers.
Hopefully not the end of the Dublin Murder Squad!"
"There's a vibe in the Dublin Murder Squad series that just kinda sinks into my skin, the accent sticks in my mouth and the story swims restlessly in my mind, then the magic ends the second the last sentence is read. How do these authors do it?"
The thing I enjoyed most about this book was listening to the audio edition. I love the various Irish accents. The book itself has many twists and turns to keep most mystery lovers engaged. My only quibble with the book is it just seemed a bit too lengthy.
"This was SO close to being a 5. Casually purchasing everything this author has ever written. I’d be shocked if her grocery list was not beautifully composed. Love to hate characters, interesting descriptions and syntax, perfect pace; scrumptious. "
French does it again! I loved getting to hear Conway’s side of things while working alongside Moran. It did start off a little slow but picked up quickly once the characters caught on to the plot twist. 
"Not bad

I loved Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway in The Secret Place and i loved them in this too. Even though the narrator has changed, it still feels like the familiar pair from the previous book."
"Twists and turns and pure Tana French. French gets you hooked on character, place and plot and there’s no putting the book down. ‘The Trespasser’ is the final novel in the Murder Squad series. Let’s just hope she writes more terrific crime fiction, she’s one of the best!"
"Tana French does it again. Her books always have me so invested. I literally think about the characters during my every day activities, like they were real people. I loved this. It was dark and brutal, but it resonated with me. Reminded me how much I love this series."
I love these books. Skipped #5 because there were too many names to keep straight in the beginning. Glad I jumped to this. The dynamics between/among the detectives is almost as interesting as the case for me. 
"Het goede nieuws is dat dit weer een fantastisch boek is (maar ja wie had anders verwacht hè, ik niet). Het slechte nieuws is dat er nu geen Dublin Murder Squad boeken meer zijn die ik kan lezen. Meh. "
I almost gave up on this - the narrative seemed bogged down on the main character's introspection and interpersonal relationships - but I'm glad I stuck with it. The story developed into a good mystery and a satisfying ending. Ms. French does not disappoint. 
"The more I read Tana French novels centering on Dublin detectives, the more I’m enjoying the slang & her attention to creating interesting characters, who are difficult yet enjoyable. A murder story with more than one surprising twist. "
"3,5 estaría mejor.
La narración es lo mejor, bien fluida. Los personajes son creíbles. Además la historia es entretenida, pero tiene unos defectos: unas teorías o líneas de investigación un tanto inverosímiles, unas cien páginas de más, un caso cerrado pero no “oleado ni sacramentado”.
"
"And just like that, it's over. I devoured this series front to back, and while this one wasn't my favorite of the lot, I still found it to be an enjoyable ride. And I'm still full of regret to have the series over and done with. Can't we have a book seven, please?"
"This book is true, deeply incredible. Vivid language, rich characterization, and an ultra-compelling central crime. I absolutely loved every page of this read. It has elevated the typical procedural to new heights. This is an EXCEPTIONAL book. I love it deeply."
"A little slow at times and one twist seemed unnecessary, but the brisk pace at the end made up for it. Loved the Irish accent of the narrator. And my favorite line: “well jumpin’ Jesus on a pogo stick” had me laughing out loud. "
"Set in Ireland, this gripping police procedural focuses on the mind games detective use during interviews. There are lots of plot twists, although the withholding of key figures becomes apparent, showing the joints of the puzzle."
"

My second book by French. A deep dive into the murky, unforgiving, foul mouth world of Dublin police. A slowly developing story of a young woman murder investigation and the twisted process that followed hampered by back keeping and mysoginist fellow detectives. Heavy vernacular Irish."
"Good mystery but incredibly annoying protagonist

The protagonist is a detective new to the mysoginist Murder Squad. She is unlikable, totally lacking in empathy, quick to judge and lacking any sense of humor. I skipped over much of introspective angst.
"
4.25 stars. Love the narration by Antoinette. Fast paced detective story involving the murder of a young woman. It dragged at one point about two-thirds of the way through. Left me guessing till the end. Looking forward to reading more Tana French
"Good characters. This one was interesting--I figured out the plot twist pretty early on, but not the whys behind the plot twist. Less a whodunnit than a whydunnit maybe.

I wish there were more Dublin Murder Squad books. They were uneven at times, but overall really fun, interesting reads."
I loved this book. Kept me fully engaged and immersed in the world of the Dublin Murder Squad. The kind of book that you look forward to getting back to and stay up late into the night reading. Highly recommend. 
"Full review to come. I have so many thoughts I want to get in order first. I will say though, that just like the rest of this series, the writing style and characters just grabbed me by the heartstrings and didn't let go. "
"3.5/3.75
I love Tana French. I love her writing, her storytelling, the build and crash her novels tend to have, and all the twists and turns her genius mind comes up with--but this one wasn't it (for me at least). I'm excited to read the searcher regardless. Fingers crossed."
Extremely compelling thriller built around the theme of the dangers inherent in the stories people tell themselves. The professional chemistry between the two lead detectives is excellently portrayed. 
"I have really enjoyed this series. I would say I didn’t love this book as much as some of the others, I found the main character to be a little annoying/whiny but overall I think the case was still an interesting mystery. "
"I love this series and I’m so disappointed it has come to an end. Great characters, each narrator introduced in the book before. Lots of twists and turns in the underlying mystery but it’s really the detectives and their back stories that make the series for me. "
"Enjoyed this for about 3/4 of it. Then, I just got weary of it. Reminded me of the great plot and complexity of Elizabeth George, whose many books books I read through the nineties and beyond. Just felt toward the end, the reader was being twisted and pulled around by a tether."
"Antoinette is weird but the case is interesting.
It's too bad the detectives all hate one another and some of them are such wankers. It would be nice to read about heroes. But I guess French is keeping it real."
was reading this for SO long and all I wanted was do get out of my reading rut but when I was determined to finish it and was sort of disappointed… I think I just drew it out too much to really enjoy the plot and appreciate the narrative??? Not my favorite in the series but it was still good 
"One of her best! She is truly the crime novel master.

I've officially finished reading all of Tana French's books. Personal ranking:
1. The Secret Place
2. The Witch Elm
3. The Trespasser
4. In the Woods
5. The Likness
6. Faithfull Place
7. Broken Harbor
8. The Searcher"
"As always with this author, the story & characters are superb, as are the descriptions of Irish culture. If I'm being totally honest I didn't like this one quite as much as some of her others, but it was still a great read."
"Every one of these books is so rich and surprising. Given the characters, the situation, everything given, this book didn't seem to have the potential to become what it became at the end, and I love that. I feel like rereading every one of these books over again."
"This is French at her best.

This is how she writes stories.

Great stuff, I liked it a lot.

My only criticism is that the backstory inside the character's head sometimes gets drawn out too long.

Other than that, quality crime storytelling."
"3.5 rounded up. It’s definitely well written and keeps you captivated, but this was pretty long for everything to feel so low stakes. Also felt like this was four entirely developed stories and all wasn’t fully needed to get to the end. "
"Tana French has definitely become one of my favorite authors but I haven't loved every Dublin Murder Squad book. This one was a little slow in places where it dragged but for the most part, I enjoyed Antoinette Conway's point of view. The realizations she has along the way."
"Solid 4 star ⭐️ Captured my attention from the start, good solid characters and excellent writing, not as gripping as ‘In the Woods’, but enjoyable in its own right. I’ll be looking out for more by Tana French for sure. "
"Definitely my least favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series. Less intense and more predictable - you get a sense of what's going on throughout the book, and I did not find the end reveal to be unexpected or shocking. Still an interesting and good story. "
"I am working my way through Tana’s Dublin murder squad series. I like some better than others. She goes into more detail about the detecting, showing how much time it takes and exposing the tedium of some of police work. "
"I found this book more tedious than the first 5 in the series. Took me longer to get invested in the story, maybe because the main detectives, Conway and Steve, didn’t have as much of a backstory and character development as the other detectives in the Dublin Murder Series."
I always enjoy Tana French. She has a knack for getting inside the minds of all the characters in a way the reader can relate. But the book was a bit long (which is also characteristic of French's writing). I will be reading her last two books next.
"First book read by this author…a recommendation. The novel is well crafted.. an intriguing storyline, many twists and turns in the plot. As I had travelled to Dublin and Ireland.. the story had a strong appeal."
"It takes every single brain cell I have to read Tana French novels, but DAMN is it worth it. Her brainnnnnnm, so large, so full of ridges and valleys.


She had me seeing shadows in my own living room. Her stories are always so dark and gritty! So so good."
"Like so many ton of French books, this one had a fascinating, complicated plot and characters that were so human and such a mix of good and bad and heartbreak that you feel you really know them. They never exactly have a happy ending, but they do have a true ending."
"I don't read a lot of mystery, but this is the kind I like - very procedural and detail-oriented. Also that the case itself wasn't personal, but that what was happening in the squad really affected it. I kind of fell off Tana French, but I'm back."
I love this series. Ms French keeps it fresh by populating the stories with different protagonists. This one in particular spoke to me especially because a younger me made so many similar mistakes in my young working life.
"One of my favorite Tana French books so far. It was well paced, and held my interest throughout. I did think the whole chip-on-her-shoulder thing was a bit too much, but no complaints other than that. A good, solid mystery."
this series is so amazing and i’m so sad that it’s over. cannot recommend this series enough. they’re more of whydunnits rather than whodunnits and they’re super character driven and just some of the best books i’ve ever read
"Тана Френч чудесная.
Но перевод просто отвратительный. Там вообще никто не напрягался, вот как было по-английски ""Jesus!"" и ""there's no chance that"" , ""there's no reason "", так оно все и было слово за слово переведено на русский, и выглядит, как словесный Франкенштейн."
"Fascinating story full of unexpected twists and turns. As always, this Tana French novel is only partially a murder mystery. It’s more importantly a character study, looking at the effect of the investigation on the people doing the investigation. And the writing is great."
"A great murder mystery, more complex and modern than expected. Great flawed characters I was cheering for, and fabulous twists. Add Tana French’s colloquialisms and it was a delight. Sad to reach the last page."
"Look, I love me an unreliable narrator as much as the next gal, and I could easily understand the opposing viewpoint, but if you're going to give the narrator an ""a-ha"" moment I'm begging you to do it before page 417. Otherwise, another fookin' winner from Tana."
"Typical Tana French book. Good mystery, unlikable characters."
Love Tana French. Her plots are intricate and keep you engaged to the very end. The Trespasser is no exception.
"I would give this just above 4 stars, 4.25 is more like. Love this author, loved this book. Figured out the ""whodunnit"" element but it was still compelling and difficult to put down"
"Another great mystery from Tana French. I thought I figured out who done it; but, even when I did know, I still couldn't guess the actual ending. "
I loved the plot but the main character - the police woman - on the murder squad was not that likable. Very fast and readable but not the author's best work. 
"I always enjoyed Tana French. This book is no different. Just when I think I've got everything figured out, she throws in another great plot twist. Great psychological thriller!"
"Gritty and raw...not the best of her murder squad books, but still hard to put down. Always unpredictable."
"Another excellent murder mystery from Tana French. This one is less ""supernatural"" than some of her earlier mysteries. Both genres are great --just depends on what you're in the mood for!"
"French develops a forceful, authentic voice in Conway. This was both a compelling character study and a gripping murder mystery. "
"Another fantastic Tana French mystery/police drama, full of completely absorbing twists and turns without being formulaic."
"This book kept my attention, but it took some patience and focus to finish. I recommend this book to those who are not in a hurry to get to the end."
"I love Tana French, but it took me a while to love this particular book. I stuck with it though, and about halfway through I started to really fall in love w the characters. "
I love this author and her ability to keep a reader engaged. Characters are interesting and so is the plot. Absolutely great story again! 
"So good! I didn't like it quite as much as I liked The Secret Place, but I just love Antoinette and Stephen and hope she'll come back to them again."
"I am a huge fan of Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad... this does not disappoint! As always her story and her characters are rich, and unexpected!"
A bit heavy on the squad room details - but a good page turner and a good story. I can't wait to read the next Murder Squad story.
"I didn't expect Steve and Antoinette to be the main detectives again since the #5 book also featured them.
"
loved this one. the character studies are fabulous. did make me wonder if this was optioned as a film already.....
Good tale; great characters; terrific twist.
"Another good mystery from Tana French. The attitude of the main character is pretty strong and can be a bit much, but overall very good."
"I genuinely enjoyed this one! Although I suspected the culprit early on, there were some nice twists in there to keep you reading. The characters were well written and enjoyable to get to know."
"By far one of her best since her debut novel! No nonsense, likable characters, great story, clearly and superbly written. French's lively voice of her protagonist engages the reader! "
This took awhile to take off for me but was classic Tana French towards the end. 
Good stuff. Very good mystery and great characters.
"Excellent book. Not as engrossing as Tana French's other novels, but still up there."
Black female detective questions police corruption while taking on murder case. Took me a bit to understand the dialect and the interrogations were a bit long-winded but I enjoyed this case/ book. 
"Another terrific, addictive read. Couldn't put it down and can't wait for the next one from this author. She can't write them fast enough. "
"A solid 4.5

Possibly an actual review to come once I have my thoughts together."
"Tana French's novels are officially too good for words. There is so much here to love, and it fits together beautifully without feeling overdetermined, and for all my feverish speculation I still did not see some parts of it coming. It feels a very solid, very mature novel, like she has a lot of ground under her, craft that she has mastered and is using while she tries a few new things. I wish I did not have to wait for her next book!"
"Juicy, and good story, though I didn't like it as well as The Likeness (the only other one of hers I've read). Maybe just because the voice of the narrator wasn't a kind of Irish speech I know, so it didn't really ring in my head the way the narration of The Likeness did."
Listened to the audiobook. It was a great mystery!
3.64 stars
Four point five.
"I think more concise writing in this book. Although, it took me longer to read. It held me in the story longer. "
"Tana French is a master of detective novels. The reader, Hilda Fay, was great."
Tana French never disappoints! One of the best mystery writers ever. 
"I liked it, but, dang, it was long! I found myself just wanting the darn thing over with. A little too Brody and negative, too."
"A bit long, but I do like this author's writing. "
"Liked this one, good solid writing. But the ending left me underwhelmed. Satisfying, but, anticlimatic, if that makes sense? Meh."
Sometimes dense but ultimately satisfying.
Took much longer than usual but I loved the book.
"Relax the kacks and shut your gob. So, obviously, I enjoyed the colorful Dublin street slang but this was a tense tale weaved around Antoinette Conway, the only female D on the Murder Squad."
"Great story. Audio book is wonderful to listen to with that Irish accent
"
I thought this was a good book but The Likeness was definitely better! I'd probably give this 3.5 and The Likeness 4.5. 
"Love the Dublin Murder squad books. this was a particularly good one featuring Antoinette Conway, the woman D everyone loves to hate."
Another great Irish writer. Excellent page turner with the Dublin Murder Squad.
"I enjoyed reading this book. There were parts where I had to research Irish slang and I think it was a bit lengthy. However, overall it was definitely a satisfying read."
Very good book. Kept you guessing until the very end. 
Love s good crime mystery. Now I gotta go back and read her others
I really enjoy the world she creates and it's hard to shake when I stop reading.
"Great characters, terrific writing. I really enjoyed it."
"Wow! Hard to start, but so glad I pushed through. "
"The gaffer getting McCann to confess--so smooth, knowing exactly what buttons to push. I hope we get one from the gaffer's perspective. Love this series. "
Have read most of Tana French books. They all seem to follow a similar pattern but I enjoy.
"It took awhile to get there, but awesome book

I highly recommend starting with Book 1 and reading through Book 6. Great series and this is a great ending to the series."
3.5 stars. Not my favorite Tana French but still good. It dragged a bit in the middle and I didn't really like the narrator. Overall though it was a fun read. 
"A 2016 staff favorite recommended by Ellen.

Check our catalog: https://encore.cooklib.org/iii/encore..."
"Tana French reliably delivers gripping and satisfying murder mysteries, with some larger themes thrown in. This one, better than her last, talks about loyalty, self-awareness and self-sufficiency."
Another great Tana French. Could not put it down
This one took a while for me to get interested in...
Still one of my fave authors. Consistently great storytelling.
"Antoinette and Steve, Murder Squad detectives, tackle a domestic and that turns into a full fledged murder investigation. Excellent addition to series."
Interesting crime novel. The Irish throws me a little but I got use to it.
Office politics thriller! 
"Tana French has never let me down, and this book is no exception."
"Engaging Irish police procedural. Less dark and conflicted than previous books, more likeable main characters, better ending. A little wordy in parts, especially suspect interviews...."
"Oh, how I loved this - I could not put it down. Tana French is a gem."
Really enjoyed this. Strong characters and plotting. The story has a very good pace which doesn't let up as it moves towards the conclusion.
"Exhausting and draining, but another big win for Tan French. "
These is a great story and very well written.
"4.5

Second favorite book in this series behind The Likeness

Seriously, these are SO GOOD. When is the next one???"
"I've loved everything by Tana French. The Trespasser was more traditional than her previous books, and that was a bit disappointing, but overall super solid and a great read."
Nice read. 
Had my problems with the main character at times due to her unbelievable degree of paranoia. The story itself was one of the best ones in the series yet. Kept me hanging until the last page.
Listening to this book was a little slow to start but it starts to move along and was a fun listen. 
Great listen as I drove to Massachusetts and back. More paranoia than your average novel. But even paranoids have enemies.
"At points the plot had too many twists and turns. But as usual for French, the character development was fantastic and was what kept me turning the pages."
Excellent
"Really loved getting another installment of Tana French. As usual, great murder mystery but so well written and loved the psychologic transformation of Antionette!"
Sometimes I like a detective story and French is a master.
Great minutely detailed procedural
A good murder mystery. 
4.5!
"I loved reading this book, as I did her first five, but I was almost halfway done with it before there was any appreciable action. Books 3 and 1 are still my faves."
"This was a great who-done-it. Not too obvious, but not too far fetched either. "
"Best since Faithful Place. Great characterization work, as always. Did not see the twists coming. A corker."
Complex. Lots of swearing. Several storylines going on at one time. Good character development.
4-4.5
"I love Tana French novels and I love the characters in this book, but unlike her other novels I found this one dragged on a bit."
Tana French nails it again!
Great book. The main character is a little snobbish. There were parts that made it seem like it was really happening.
This was my first Tana French book and I loved it!
"Nice plot twists I didn't predict in addition to good character development.
"
Tedious & complicated but good
"I admit it. I love Tana French. I especially loved this book. Not too gory, lots of intrigue and the ending of my dreams. "
"Great book, disappointing ending. "
If you like murder mysteries this is a good one. I like when you don't really know who done it! I couldn't put it down.
The last of the series?
"PDL's Rating: 4 Punches (Liked)

I definitely will be reading more of this author's work."
A zoomer of a book! I now want to read the rest of the series ...
I have enjoyed all of Tana French's books. This one did not disappoint. She writes a great crime thriller.
"Good mystery. Antoinette was a little too bitter for most of the book, but rallied at the end."
Loved listening to this book on tape--it was completely gripping. And the Irish accent of the narrator helped enormously.
Always enjoy her take on the hard-boiled crime fiction. This wasn't her best but was still a fun read. 
3.5. Liked it in general but thought some areas could have been trimmed down. Fine to listen to on a long road trip though
Thoroughly enjoyed this murder mystery. Kept guessing as more twists and turns developed. Great character and narrative to draw the reader along. 
Pretty decent story on the order of a good Ian Rankin novel. I will read her other books. 
A good mystery with a lot of complexity! 
"Very well written, great characters and good twisty plot. Loved the Dublin setting. "
Very engaging. Took me awhile to see where it was headed. So far she has not lost stride on the series.
Another great mystery by French. Couldn't put it down.
Una novela diferente que me ha enganchado 
"I didn't think I was going to like it, but I did. "
"The actual writing is worth a 5, but it gets draggy through the middle because the book is just too long for the story. A good editor to tighten it up would have made it even better."
Another great Tana French novel. Enjoyed every minute of it!
"Another excellent read from Tana French. She does this so well. Very good descriptions of relationships and their complexities. More, please."
"Not my favorite case, but Antoinette Conway may be one of my favorite of French's characters. Another well written, complex, and layered novel by the best crime writer of our time. "
"Quirky characters, well-told, riveting by the end."
I really enjoyed it. Her use of language is super.
"Better than average police procedural. (Purchased at McNally Jackson bookshop in SoHo, New York)"
"Maybe a 3.5, simply because I didn't enjoy it as much as her previous works. Great plot, though."
"Antoinette Conway , Dublin, Ireland"
I enjoyed the story about the personal struggles of Det Antoinette Conway. The investigation of the death of a young woman was interesting and there is plenty of suspense.
Terrific-didn't want to put it down.
This is much better than her last two books but Antoinnette is driving me crazy. What a self absorbed irritating character!
Always a good read from Tana French but nothing will ever beat In the Woods.
Another good mystery by Tana French.
The Audible narrator on this book was fantastic! 
The beauty of this story is that the real mystery is not so much the crime as the character. 
"Good mystery, liked the characters & Irish slang throw in ie gaff, jacks, gaffer. Think it would have moved a little better if edited more, shorter. "
Nobody does haunted souls like Tana French. 
"Probably my least favorite of the series, but still good. Got better towards the end. "
"Although I figured out who did it within the first third of the book, the why it happened kept me reading. The characters became more interesting and intricate as the story progressed. "
"Gritty detective stories are not my thing. Too often it is an excuse for bad writing. But this was splendid, character-driven and intricate."
"Very good - well developed plot and interesting characters, but perhaps 100 pages too long? "
"Another great mystery by Tana French, with both victim and detective dealing with the search for their fathers and taking back their power"
"this was my fave of the 6 books so far, despite my dislike dor the crass/rough around the edges main character/narrator. listened on audio and the voices were fantastic!!"
"Another excellent addition to this series. Strong writing, dialogue, and character development. Didn't love the plot as much as some of the others, but still definitely worth the read."
"Very good, suspenseful. Kept thinking it was going to go a different way. The main character is likeable in the fact that she can be so unlikeable. "
"Another solid addition to the series. The ending was satisfying, which I was getting worried about towards the end because you never know with her books. "
On the low end of 4 Stars. Not much happens in this book except a lot of what ifs and maybes. But it’s well told even if not a thrilling tale. 
Murder Squad rookies investigate the death of a pretty young girl.
Great book!
"Foul mouthed Irish detective. Good plot, easy fun read."
"This story started out well, slumped big time in the middle (almost didn’t finish it).... but in the end I had to choose between three or four stars. I chose four. "
Did part book and part audio. Was to go to a gathering to discuss but didn't have done in time.
great thriller ! better than her first book
Slow moving at first but then gets you going and leaves you with a pit in your stomach. It was a little long but overall I really liked it. 
"Not as atmospheric as some of the other Dublin murder squad mysteries, but I enjoyed spending time with Detective Antoinette Conway. Enjoyed the audiobook version. "
Excellent - I might be biased as I'm Irish but the writing and dialogue are spot on. On top of that its a great story.Recommended.
Tana French always delivers. A terrific police procedural with extremely well-drawn characters. I truly loved the scene with the Gaffer at the very end. 
"thank you tana, for not pulling another rob and cassie forever estranged on me. i don’t think my heart could have taken it"
"Protagonist was very disagreeable and not very likeable. The book however, was good and fast paced. "
I listened to this and found it pretty engrossing. The Irish accents are enjoyable and the mystery is good. (Lots of language though.)
"Even if you think you've figured out whodunnit, this one keeps you spellbound right to the very satisfying end. Great read."
"Appeal: The Trespasser is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad serie,s but what I love about this series from a RA standpoint is the series does not have to be read in order. The books are linked [some more than others] and the main character of one story might reappear in the background of another but all have their chances to be the sympathetic hero one time and a foil another. And, it really doesn't matter when you encounter which experience.

I have had lots to say about French and all of her books over the years. Use this link for more: http://raforall.blogspot.com/search?q....

But in general the main reason I like French and why she is one of my sure bet authors is her ability to write people into her stories-- fully realized, complex, annoying at times, people. These people that populate her stories are not just characters.

Her stories are gripping, intricately plotted and have wonderful intense first person narrations.

These are psychological suspense stories. The narrators are flawed, often hiding something from the reader, and the miseries are complex. Every book has a compelling mystery on its own

That narration is one of the reasons I think they work so well on audio. I have listened to every single one. The narrators are all different but that is because there is a different character at the helm for each book.

The writing is tight. There are details yes, but the stories move at a compelling pace. If you like complicated plots where every word counts and yet it still moves at a brisk pace, th

Anxiety is high. The story is tightly wound.

Interestingly, I have listened to every French book I have read. I started that way and I enjoyed the experience so I kept going in that format. At this point, having French read to me is the only way I could take in these stories.

Notice I haven't even gotten to this book in particular at all, and I won’t. I included it above from the publisher.

Three Words That Describe This Book: intense first person narration, complex characters, tightly wound

Readalikes: I have listed many before. Again, use this link for details [http://raforall.blogspot.com/search?q...], but I have a new readalike option--Ausma Zehanat Khan. I reviewed the first book in her mystery series on Goodreads too."
"Solid Tana French... not her best, but thoroughly enjoyable. "
"Good read. Didn't realize it was part of a series, reads well on its own, but I will check out the others. "
A very fresh and engaging summer read. Aislinn is psycho! But you gotta admire her level of determination. 
Riveting. 
Another good book from Tana French. She never disappoints me. 
The usual good read by Tana French. 
"Just good

Good character development as always, well developed story line, but i predicted the end from the start. Hate it when that happens."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There was never dull for me, but I would have liked more at the end. "
"A great murder mystery as it is not only the murder itself, but also a look into the murder squad itself, which is not as storybook as we might like to make it. I always enjoy Tana French's books."
"A winner

This may be my favorite of Tana French's after ""In the Woods"". The last 200 pages were spellbinding. Really enjoyed the suspense. Highly recommend!"
My new favorite detective story writer.
Tana French is the queen of psychological tension. 
"As always strong characters, solid plot, a great read"
Great detective fiction. I look forward to Tana French’s next novel.
When will the next book from Tana French be released? I just can't wait. 
I enjoyed this very very much !!! Tana impresses me every time!! What a great series 
"Too descriptive, compared to other books. I found myself skimming over parts to move it along, but still a good read."
"This is my Pop Sugar 2018 Reading Challenge - the next book in a series you started.

I always enjoy her books and this one didn’t disappoint!"
"Tana French is always a good read. I sometimes get lost in the 200-250 page mark and think ""just get to the end!"" but I love the characters and all the back story and the language particularly."
"Great book, and I didn’t see “it” coming in regards to the reveal of the bad guy. Listened to this as an audiobook and enjoyed every second. "
Great dialogue. Loved the narrator Hilda Fay. 
page turner
This was my second Tana French and the first Dublin Squad I've read. I loved it. it was gripping and held me from the first to the end.
I liked the protagonist so much and the themes of her uphill climb as a woman and a minority felt really timely. 
I'm sad that I finished this series but I loved every minute of it 😊
Been on a police detective binge. Listened to this one - loved the narrator.
"The usual Tana French. Good plot,interesting and fun book!"
"Fast paced, red herrings everywhere."
I wonder if this is the end of the series. It kind of felt like Tana French saying goodbye to the Dublin Murder Squad by blowing it up. 
"Another solid mystery from Tana French, don’t be tempted to peak at the end like i did! Hope she’s going to keep writing more books!"
way too wordy. needs to be edited 
Book #6 in the series. Read if you like crime fiction and mysteries. 
"This one took me a bit longer to get into but Tana always wins me over. Please, please Tana, keep writing brilliant murder mysteries. Don’t make us wait too long for the next. "
"Another winner from one of my favorite authors. Well written, murder mystery, takes place in Dublin Ireland. great character development, lots of detail to evoke the setting, really fun to read."
"Good, but not as enjoyable as some of her previous novels."
Another good one from French. I liked this detective and her partner more so than the last couple. 
Hats off to Tana French for another great book involving the Dublin Murder Squad. I love this series and I love this author. Can’t wait for the next one! 
"3.5 stars. I really enjoy this series, but i wasn’t a fan of the narrator/ main character so I didn’t like this one as much as French’s earlier books."
Good book. Great lead character and enough of twists to keep the reader engaged.
This was slow moving at first but worth sticking with. 
Over all a very enjoyable detective story. Some of the words I needed a dictionary for and it was hard to understand words that got shortened down to 1 or 2 letters. It made them annoying to read. 
Intense as her books always are
"A very enjoyable murder mystery, set in Ireland, so includes language distinct to the culture."
"This was the first of French's books I've read, but won't be the last. Love the pacing and her characters. "
"Not my typical read, but I enjoyed it. Might read back in the series since this was my first."
"gran bella sorpresa, thriller super solido, di quelli lenti ma che arrivano alla conclusione senza salti improbabili passo dopo passo"
Another great book by Tana French.
Tana French does it again....she is easily my new favorite author! 
Better than some of the others. I liked that the plot was equally matched by the character insights. Not all characters evenly developed but still a good read. 
I have enjoyed all her novels
"Typically great, and this is one of her better ones."
"A really really solid detective novel. I didn't want to put it down. Good atmosphere, great writing, and overall very likable (or at least very interesting) characters."
"Fantastic narrator. Love the brogue, it brings so much to the story."
"..e per avere qualche dettaglio

https://sensazionidilettura.blogspot.it/
"
Modern day crime novel set in Dublin. The main character is the only woman on the Dublin Homicide Squad. Interesting who done it.
I feel like DMS books are getting slower and harder for me to get into but I REALLY enjoyed the ending amd the characters
"Solid, standard Tana French. "
LOVED this Irish Detective series! 
Not my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books - it does get better as it moves along but ultimately not satisfying for me.
Thoroughly enjoyable. Loved both the audible and kindle versions. A zillion f words--just fyi.
The main character’s negativity was hard to get over. Good story but took me a long time to read for whatever reason.
"Tana French does it again

Another interesting protagonist and twist to the finish! Just not sure who will be next. Are we out of murder detectives now?!?"
A little disappointing. I really loved the others in this series but this just wasn't as engaging.
"Awesome, as is the entire series ."
I like Tana French...what else can I say
Hilda Fay’s narration in the audio book bumped up the rating for me.
Fast paced storyline with very relatable characters. Learned some new Irish colloquialisms too. Will read more by her. 
"3.5, but rounding up. I wanted a little bit more out of this book, but I still love the author, and it was a great read."
Fairly gripping!
I will read more in this series.
"True detective
The case was talked about so much from every angle
By the end I was like ok already
"
I recently discovered Tana French. I am so glad that I did.
Tana French is a genius
Another excellent novel by French. Her characters have just the right mix of tough and vulnerable. I also liked this story's theme of daughters coming to terms with absentee fathers.
I love a good Tana French crime mystery!
"And per usual: another great read and I will now take a break, but will definitely be reading everything she has written, and that she will still write:)"
I liked the book. I tried it on Audio but I couldn’t follow it. I borrowed the book from the library and it was s good read. I look forward to the next book. 
"I am not good at book reviews so can only comment that this was a good book, kept me guessing,enjoyed reading this..."
"So much more than a “ thriller”. The narrator/protagonist makes plenty of errors in judgment. But her instincts are good, and she and her partner work well together. A Good Read! "
"French once again puts together a murder mystery where the complex characters and relationships are just as important as solving the mystery, if not more so. I especially enjoyed Antoinette Conway as the no-nonsense narrator of the novel."
Another great installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series
Another great book by Tana French. I really enjoyed this series.
3.75
Probably my least favorite of the Tana French books (I've read all but #5). But it's still good. She does interrogations so much better than anyone else.
Muy fan de la personalidad de Antoinette y su manera de narrar las cosas.
Listened to the audiobook and loved the accents! 
A well written crime novel . I might try one of her those books 
A great book in this continuing series.
"Tana French is back. I was worried after reading The Secret Place, but not now."
Solid police procedural. 
I am just convinced that the Dublin Mystery Squad would not be possible without unprofessional and rather bad detectives.
"I have really enjoyed reading the Dublin Murder Squad series from Tana French. Her books are excellent, not easy to predict the ending, full of surprises and twists. "
"A lot of dialogue, but very good story overall"
Liked the twists and characters.
"She truly outdoes herself with every new book, doesn't she? This was a fantastic read. "
This book took me on a journey. Lots of twists and turns that kept me coming back for more. Liked it.
"I like that this one didn't end where I thought it was going to. I also really hope it isn't the last in the series, though I know she's publishing a new book soon that isn't Dublin Murder Squad."
A great page-turner - one of my favourites from this series so far. 
"Really good look at borderline gaslighting and French's usual fucked up narrators, good mystery."
"Great, now I have to go buy the rest of this series."
"As usual from Tana French, she delivers a complex mystery with interesting characters."
Oct 2018
This was the first book by this author that I have read. I thought it was good. I enjoyed the main characters and the plot twists. It kept my interest. I will check out more by Tana French. 
Excellent 
Best one yet.
"This book starts off a little slow but once it gets going, it's a good read. "
Gifted story teller.
We met with the gaffer to talk about Gaffney's talk with the vic's mate at her gaff. Then we caught a gaff and ate a bit of gaff and headed back to the smurf.
Tana French never leaves me disappointed. Another fantastic read!
"Like Murder Squad #5, the novel starts slowly; for a reader looking for action, it’s to the point of dragging. But it eventually takes off and is a fine mystery."
Another outstanding police procedural by Tana French. Page turner as per usual. And this one had a very satisfying ending.
3.5 stars. Love this series.
"Meticulous procedural, with extreme, if a little stretched, specificity in it's interrogation scenes."
Good story! So descriptive. Makes you feel like you’re the one on the case! 
My favorite Tana French since the first 3 Dublin Murder Squad books. Good read to end the year on!
Really liked the book and characters. Tana French is on her game. Highly recommend the book to mystery/murder enjoying readers. 
"Not my favorite Tana French novel, but readable."
"Good beginning and end, but a bit long in the middle."
"Excellent read, very exciting."
"If you have liked other Dublin Murder Squad titles, you'll love this."
very good read. twisty plot
3.5
"Twists and turns, a really good mystery"
"Audio version excellent. Excellent writing. Strong female protagonist, a bit too much at times. A solid mystery."
A re-read/commute-audio while waiting for her new one.
Excellent police procedural. I’m going back to read French’s earlier work because I very much enjoyed The Witch Elm. 
Gives insight into how a murder investigation works. Antoinette is a complicated but intriguing character. She has good interplay with her partner Moran. 
I love Tana French and her Dublin Murder Squad books - if you are a fan of the series then you will love this one :) 
"Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Full of twists and turns and fully realized characters, this was very entertaining."
"Not my favorite Dublin Murder Squad--possibly because it also seems like the most realistic and plausible, in terms of suspension-of-disbelief plot elements--but still a page-turner. "
One of her best.
"She can write...but...

Really enjoy her writing but it takes SO many words! I breezed through many, many pages just to get on with the story."
My first Tana French but certainly not my last. Good subway reading. Great character development in a murder mystery of both the detectives and suspects. 
I liked this book. But I thought is was a little long for what the actual story ended up being.
Definitely some strong work once again from Tana French. I was hoping she’d weave in some of the other books cases in this one but no luck. Still excellent writing. 
Fun read. 
"If you have a reading block, French is a sure shot remedy. Her 5th Dublin Squad mystery is as riveting as all the others. Am such a fan!"
Such an enjoyable thriller with a fantastic hard-boiled lady detective protagonist. So. Much. FUN.
"This genre doesn't get enough respect because it's the same narrative characters and context as with visual media such as television and film, but this is brilliantly written and read."
"If you like Tana French, or good mysteries in general, this is a great read. I breezed through it in one weekend."
"It took me a while to get into it, and when I did, I couldn't put it down. It probably could haven 100 pages shorter, but I did enjoy the author's writing style, tho the dialogue was a little salty."
3.5 stars I really enjoyed the mystery. Well written
Really unputdownable. Great crime fiction with flawed protagonists.
Gripping and satisfying crime story.
Excellent series set in Dublin.
Good read but giving it 4 not 5 because it was a bit repetitive.
A hard-to-like heroine...but I'm glad I stuck it out. A satisfying close. Worth the time to work through.
My least favorite of the series. I just didn't love Antoinette as narrator and found the mystery less compelling.
Entertaining but so so long!
"Complex story about a murder of a young woman in Dublin. The protagonist weaves through facts and evidence of the case while dealing with personal adversity, and parallels to the victim."
Glad there was much less magical realism in this one.
Enjoyable as always with this series.
"Toke a while to get started, but once it did it was hard to put down"
"I personally had trouble listening to the audiobook because of the accents, but a good story."
This is the second book I have read by this author. It starts out a bit slow and unfocused but it does keep my attention and is a good read.
would read more Tana French
Love Tana French books. She’s the only suspense/mystery writer I read. It’s not my usual genre. I’m still trying to figure out how the title The Trespasser works though!
A mix of 5 star detective work and 3 star relating of the inner thoughts and thinking of the main character. This was my first book by French; I'll probably try another.
"This book LOVES the interview room, and Tana French makes it feel electric to be there with the detectives. "
Slow to start then moves right along.
Hard boiled and immersive. French is a master crime writer. And I love all the Irish that comes out in her dialogue. 
I had been a bit ready to give up on this series but glad I stuck with it for this one 
"Good read, just long to get to the point and the solving of the mystery "
4.5*
Tana French is great with dialogue but it gets tiresome while reading. I listened to this 21 hour long CD while on two long drives and enjoyed it very much. 
Tana Frenchhasnt let me down yet. Another good one!
If you like Tana French - just read it!! 
Felt the book could have been shorter. 
Another tana french classic. Love the series !
"I didn't love the narrator of this story as much as some of her others, but Tana French tells a reliably good murder mystery - perfect for the summer."
"maybe closer to 3.5, but after the odd and unwelcome fantasy element of the last installment, the return to realism was a relief"
"It is a good book, just not what I was in the mood for.. I wanted more of thriller, not a crime detective novel. Something faster paced"
"Definitely on par with In the Woods and Faithful Place, but The Likeness remains my absolute favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books."
Super compelling quick read. 
Steve read it. 4.5
I love Tana French’s plots and relationship she builds between the detectives. I had to take a break however from her novels due to the raw language she uses in dialogue between her characters. 
"The main character, at times is hard to relate to. The book overall has a great story and good flow. Still a must-read"
Not my favorite Tana French but I still liked it. She is so good at what she does. 
"This mystery is amazing. I really liked the character development of the main character, Antoinette Conway. Tana French is one of the finest mystery writers, IMHO."
I didn't read this in order of series but the detective part didn't matter. I like the way French writes and detective stories are always enjoyable for me. 
Maybe up to 5 stars. My favourite Tana French so far. 
Tana French is the queen of mystery! 
"Pretty good whodunit.
You'll enjoy."
4.5 Story about the stories we tell ourselves. 
Compelling story! Stayed up too late reading it for a few nights. 
"Совершенно в другом стиле, чем ""Тайное место"", но по прежнему хорошо. Плюс изящная концовка."
Dragged in the middle and Conway was very unlikable for a good portion but it finished well. 
"A good mystery murder! Could have done without the swears, but i loved reading the Irish dialects and this mystery kept me on my toes. "
Sad to be done with the Murder squad.
"Read it on my iPad, so can’t really say it’s a page-turner I guess. But a bumpy and terrific ride. Another good one from a solid writer."
"3.5/4. Extremely more straightforward than the other Tana French's I've read and a little less lyrical, but still a step above most procedurals."
"3.5

took me a WHILE to really get into it but once everything started falling into place i read for nearly 4 hours straight"
Entertaining with twist
"Love her style, Tana French is one of my favorite writers. The twist wasn't surprising so 3.5 stars. "
The audio book is good.
"4.5 stars...This was not my favorite book in the series, Conway is a hard one to get attached to however I still really enjoyed the writing and the overall story. "
"Tana French is the queen of slow burn mystery. I don't know how she managed to keep my interest peaked for this book, because it truly was slow going, but I enjoyed every page anyways. "
Love this series with complicated characters and uncommon situations.
"Detectives solve murder but feel remorse

Case has many twists and turns to follow...but the real drama is what the human factor that the detectives must deal with after."
Interesting story with a great plot . Tara French is a great author and I will certainly read more of her books 
Loved this one! 4.5 stars
"Related to Conway way more than I would have thought. An excellent mystery, and the twist still has me reeling a bit."
Wow does she know how to craft a detective story! Went through a wave of emotions living next to these characters for the week. 
"This book was hard to put down. I was afraid it might have a less than satisfying ending, but was pleased that justice was served. "
This was my favorite so far by this author.
It took me a while to really get into this one but I flew through the last quarter! I really hope Tana French writes another Dublin Murder Squad book.
"Loved it! Hooked from the first few pages. Fantastic character development, situational intricacies and believable vignettes. Can’t wait to start reading more from Tana French. "
"Always a good read.

Good characters. Lots of plot twists. And that Dublin vernacular to give it a good sense of place. Goood craic."
3.5 stars
3.5 closer to a 4. Steve and Antoinette's friendship is 10/10
One of the better books in this series. 
"3.5
"
A couple chapters are a little tedious but overall it’s a good read. 
"Loved it, can't wait to read the others. Great plot, great characters, great setting!"
"Okay, I have officially joined the ranks of the Tana French fans. "
This is one of French's best psychological murder stories. Paranoia and father figures!
Had me going till the very end!
She writes complicated mysteries. I have trouble figuring out who did it. Hats off to her.
"A decent book. Plot about a dead woman and how she was murdered, and for what reason,"
Took me awhile to get into this. Once I did I throughly enjoyed this murder mystery. I will definitely try another of her books when I am in the need for a smart mystery read.
"Enjoyed this. Writing clean and characters well developed. A good detective novel, with the addition of an insiders view of a detective squad. Rooted firmly in Dublin, which is a good thing."
"The ending was a bit anticlimactic of this one, but I pretty sure that was the point"
I thought my job was hell! It must be great to find your backup is really there for you but you have to take your blinders off and stop feeling sorry for yourself. 
This may be closer to a 4.5 - Tana French is such a damn good writer!
I have enjoyed all of her Dublin murder mysteries and this was a great one.
Good series...sorry to reach the end!
I liked the story but felt it dragged out in some places. 
I have loved this series and enjoyed this one too!
"I’d read this as a paper book but listened to it a second time around. Reader did a great job, hearing the Irish accent really added to the story. Tana French has never disappointed me yet! "
"I love Tana French. I’ve read her books out of order, but always a great twist at the end. Made up for the slow start, but knowing the author I knew I needed to push through. Always a treat! "
"Awww read like a good cop show. Jaded heroine, personable partner... I want more of their stories! "
"Super good. Hard to put down. Great characters, lots of twists and a good ending."
Very entertaining but might have been shorter.
The protagonist in this series is a hoot. I’ll read some of the other books.
"I had difficulty liking the viewpoint character at first, but the second half of the book made up for it, and also picked up the pace. "
3.5 stars 
3.8
"Good story, but I’d have preferred it to be more concise. In the end I liked it, but the beginning & middle were a bit of a slog to get through. So many words :-)"
"I liked this one! It dragged on a little in the middle and was frustrating at times, but overall it was a great compelling mystery if that’s what you’re in the mood for! "
"3½ stars. Loved listening to this book, my first Tana French read."
I liked the second half of this more than the first but it is so exhausting to watch Antoinette get in her own way 
This one is more of a slow burner than her others in the series. Well worth persisting though for the fabulous exploration of character. 
Really good book.
"Classic Tana French. Nothing beats INTO THE WOODS, but this is a solid, engaging mystery. "
"4.5
Never met a Tana French book I didn't love. Great twists and turns as always."
3.75 rounded up
Not my favorite Tana French book but an engaging “who done it”. The plot was complicated but hope to the “D” team of Conway and Moran again...
Great Irish detective yarn. A broad swath of interesting and mostly believable characters. 
Riveting plot with a not-very-sympathetic central character. Well done.
"The main character was incredibly unlikable, which may have been the point. But, it was hard to read about her constantly. She was always ready for a fight, even though there was no fight to be had."
If you have enjoyed the Dublin murder squad series you will enjoy this latest version. I think t is one of the stronger outings.
"Liked it. Like all her books. Had a bit of trouble getting to like Conway but got her in the end. Great cop mystery. Recommend it highly.
"
"Procedural mysteries-love the TV genre, but the literary genre, not so much. Except for Tana French. This is typical Tana French. If you’re a fan, you’ll enjoy it. "
"Great characters. Strong murder case. Unfortunately, this plot just drug on too long, like a back-and-forth yo-yo that’s dizzying but no fun. "
Great narration on this one. 
"steve & antoinette out here repairing my partner trauma from in the woods!! i love them!! 4 stars from me, 1 star from my roommates who have to deal with me saying ""relax the kacks"" every 10 minutes."
Просто хороший детектив
Felt like a slow start but once it picked up I was hooked! 
Enjoyed the audio version. 
Like this author. Good read. Immediately picked up another by this author. 
"Another great book in this series. Same formula as the others, but it works for me. "
"least favorite of the 6, second to worst narrator; still a great read"
a great mystery! I enjoyed how the whole story took place over a week’s time - Tana French puts so much detail into her writing! 
"3.5. predictable, but taut and well written, nonetheless. I found the female protagonist to be smart, darkly funny, and strong, which kept me engaged."
Love this authors stories. One of those book’s I can get lost in. 
"This was the slowest burn I've ever read. I almost quit, but I cared enough to find out ""Whodunnit?"" 4 stars is a good rating considering yesterday I was thinking it was a 2."
"So sad to have finished this series, but I loved them. I love the deep character studies. Each one left me wanting more. "
"Liked it. First Tana French book I've read, and I'd read another.

Liked the main character, a female detective. This is a genuine who dunnit."
Very long.
Best book of the Dublin Murder series
Solid read. 
I hope Tana French will keep adding to this series. I love her character driven plot lines. And the audiobook versions have been well done!
"I’ll read everything Tana French writes - she’s that good. (Technically, listened to this one on audiobook, which I’d recommend, as you get the Irish accent!)"
The only reason it didn't get five stars is because the protag was...not one-dimensional...but not as multi-dimensional as in other books of hers. 
I hope this is not the last of the Murder Quad novels. Very tightly wound plot and lovely surprises.
"This is the second book I've read by this author and I'm really enjoying her work. I'm not usually a mystery reader, but she keeps things moving, characters are real and relatable."
Loved this!! Lots of twists and surprises! 
I will admit lice all the Murder Squad book and this one does the trick. 
"Good twists and turns.
Some i saw coming some i didn't."
"My first Tana French. Tough to stick with such a prickly and unhappy main character, but worth it in the end. "
"After The Secret Place, I was really hoping to get a novel from Antoinette Conway’s perspective. Definitely my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series so far."
This is a LONG novel but contains enough story detail to keep you interested. It doesn't bog down with lots of detail of scenery or environment. 
"Slow burn, good plot twat, like able yet flawed characters. Best mystery I’ve read ithis year.

Wonderful performance by Hilda Fay. So far it looks like this her only audiobook. Hope she does more."
yes yes yes
👏👏 A great last book in the series. Completely made up for The Secret Place.
Another great installment! Surprisingly positive ending. Guessed the murderer but there’s still a twist. Still love books 2 and 5 best. Hope she does more!!! 
"So twisty. So good. So beautifully written. French takes me away, every time. She knows more about humanity than anyone should. "
"Not my favorite one, only because I called the murderer painfully quickly in, but an enjoyable ride all the same. "
"Loved Conway and her dynamic with Moran. The interview scenes were amazing.

I set aside this book for a long time because I was not ready to finish this phenomenal series. Hoping for more to come."
The ending was much more satisfying than the expected one.
Really good read.
"I love her books. They are like watching a really good episode of Dateline or 48 Hours, but in book form, which is always better. "
"(3.5) A little bit slow, but still enjoyed it"
"This was a great audiobook. I loved the Irish accents. But the story was very intriguing. I thought it was a bit slow at times, but I did really like the ending. It was not what I was expecting. "
3.7 
После первых 100 страниц любой книги Таны Френч мне почему-то хочется повеситься от безысходности. Но красиво. 
Leave it to Tana French to have me making guesses and waiting to see what was true
I fully look forward to sitting in the sunroom of my retirement cottage 20-odd years from now and reading Book 27 in the Dublin Murder Squad series
Excellent audio book
Fiquei presa ao livro da primeira à última página.
This one kept me guessing 80% of the way through. Brilliantly detailed with characters who were very 3D. French always writes a good book. Worth a read. 
4.5 
Loved this one too! Kept me guessing until the end.
I have read many of Tana French’s books and love them. I listened to this one and the reader is great. I would definitely listen to more by her. 
a little slow at the beginning - finally got better at the end. 
"Non stop listening. So enjoyed this mystery. Every one in the series is so different, yet slightly connected. I’d like to see a time/department roster of the murder office. "
"Tana French writes men very well but this book is written from a female lead, but one that suffers in ways similar to many women. "
"Tana""s books are always worth the time to read. I particularly enjoy her characters. They are always well fleshed out and interesting. Complete enough that you feel you know them."
3.75*
Definitely enjoyed this one much more than the last two. 
Tana French is at her best writing about driven detectives and strong minded women. One of her better books in this series.
Good read! Loved Antoinette: a great portrayal of the lone female detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. 
Another great read from Tana French. Hoping this isn't the last in the series.
"Tana French has a style that is both intriguing and witty. This book definitely makes you wait for it, but it’s worth it. "
Brilliant - love Tana French!
"Slow burning mystery, I loved every second of it."
"Lots of twists

Read this in a day. Which is when I know a book grabbed me. Well drawn characters strong procedural. Kept me guessing. A good read."
3.5/4 stars
"Tana French is the perfect winter break read--or any time, really. Smart and layered mystery. I have a mind to head to the library and check out all her books! "
Very good whodunnit. It’s not over until it’s over which I liked. Loved the language which I’m assuming is authentic. A little too much wandering into the weeds but still solid. 
A bit wordy in spots and not much of a real mystery but I did love the narrator/woman detective as a character and liked her growth arc
really intricate story of a death tied to a XXX (don't want to give away the reveal).
I think I'd give this one 4.5/5. Good pace and I was already interested in the characters from the previous book.
Great read. Only problem was the drag towards the end when we had to hear all of the evidence again. 
"I enjoyed this one, keeps you guessing."
One of the better ones of the series. Antoinette and Moran made me almost feel like we were back to the Rob and Cassie days.
"Love this series! This one is filled with layers of complex issues for the detectives as well as the victim.
Written with a great ear for language, nuance and suspense"
Another terrific Tana French detective mystery! 
Held my attention more than #5- I’m over teenage angst.
I liked this much better than her previous book. The plot kept twisting and turning.
Really good story. A lot of swearing but the mystery was really good and the characters and story were very well written. 
"I really enjoyed this book, this was my first Tana French book and definitely won't be my last."
"Took a loooooong time for me to get into this one, but once I did it went quickly! Every time I start to doubt Tana French, she proves me wrong. "
"Gripping, with lots of twists and feeling of not knowing who to trust
I was a little disappointed with the ending -
for some reason I was expecting one last twist"
"It took about half of the book to really get into it, but then I couldn’t put it down!"
Thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the character development and the twists and turns.
"I always love Tana French’s stories but I just feel like there’s a lot of fluff that could come out, this book especially just felt a hundred pages longer than it needed to be. "
Good police procedural from the Dublin murder squad. Love the Irish accents from the reader. 
I listened and loved the Dublin language. Good cop procedural. 
Love this author. Language warning
Why is it so long
"Really slow start. Had a hard time getting to the halfway point, bit after that I was hooked."
Still tied with Gillian Flynn for the best murder mystery writer there is
Good enough that I got 100 pages in before I remembered that I had read it.
Finally a main character who doesn’t self-destruct. 
"Didn't realize this was a series but it worked fine as a stand alone too.
It kept me turning pages and enjoying the twists and turns."
"“If I learned one thing in school, it’s this: you never let them get you on the bottom of the pile. If you do, you might never get up again.”"
"Loved the suspense! Very exciting read, makes you feel like you are in Dublin with all the local words and places. "
"I really like her work. This is a Dublin Murder Squad story, pretty good plot, believable characters, keeps your attention."
Good mystery with a character who develops well along the way. It was as fun to see her develop insight as it was to see the mystery solved.
"Very clever plot. Truly, a page-turner."
Probably the best one of the series.
Another great “read” by Tana French. I listen to her books and love the narration. 
"la protagonista es tan insoportable que estuve a punto de abandonarlo. hubiera sido una lastima, es un buen libro"
"A refreshing and engaging murder mystery. Detailed, deliberate, and immersive. The interrogation scenes are exceptional."
Good police detective story. Will definitely read more of this author.
Not as good as others of hers I've read. The ending was terrific but it was tough slogging to get there.
"Conway and Moran are my favorite duo. Once again, Tana French keeps me speeding through her novels while she unravels more and more twists. "
"Good mystery, great exploration of imposter syndrome and how it seeps into every thought until one becomes one's own worst adversary."
This is my second tana French book and I have LOVED both of them! This was more of a slow burn but I really appreciate how she keeps you guessing and makes it harder to know for sure who did what. 
great read
Still so good but where was the magic TANA?!
I loved this book and plan to read others. I didn't know it was a series so I started out with one of the later books but I had no problem keeping up with what was going on and the characters.
Thoroughly enjoyed!
Good murder-detective story with well-developed characters that kept me guessing about the killer. I'm a fan of most detective stories set in the UK and this is no exception. Recommended.
"A good crime novel, especially if you are a fan of Call of Duty TV series.

Quite gritty descriptions of being on a murder squad and a few twists on the way.

Easy read but enjoyable all the same."
"Good yarn, kept me up too late. Good character development. Only complaint is it could have been 100 pages shorter. "
Si legge tutto d'un fiato. Un giallo molto ben scritto con i personaggi ben caratterizzati.
"Probably the best Dublin Murder Squad book yet, in my opinion. I was left with a few unanswered questions, but that's her style. "
"Great story

Great story of delicate balance between the truth and an easy way out. The only thing that matters is the real story."
"Another excellent entry in the Dublin Police Squad series. The pacing is very slow in this one, but the payoff is big, both in plot and characters. Have patience. "
4.25
"4.5 stars. I can't get enough of Tana French's Murder Squad book, and I think this one was my favorite. Maybe 5 stars. Excellent writing and characterization. "
"Och jak mi smutno, że to już koniec wieczorów z dublińskimi detektywami 😢"
"Not really liking the character of Detective Conway. But, the story was interesting, but slow, and the ending was well thought out and believable."
"I don’t particularly care for the main character/narrator, but as usual tana french’s attention to detail and fluid writing are such a treat! this book had me in suspense until the last few pages. "
Well defined characters in this one! Not sure if I will go back but I will read any future books with Steve and Antoinette. 
Good mystery! The reader's voice was perfect for the tough female detective narrator/protagonist.
Last one in the series. So sad that I’m done. Loved all 6 but I liked this one best of all. 
"3.5 stars. The overall case story was good, but Antoinette was just really unlikeable to me—I got the character resolution at the end, but it was tedious to get through her emotional baggage. "
I think this was my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books.
Police procedures and thought processes. Intriguing.
I think Antoinette & Stephen might be my favorite detective combo so far. 
"I liked this one. Not as much as the one I read previously, but it was still good enough for me to want to keep reading everything of hers my library has to offer."
It was strange reading this book because the murderer has the same last name as mine. The head of the squad has the same last name as a friend in a film club I belong to.
"Enjoyed reading this book Tana French is so descriptive in her writing. I felt like a witness in her story….she writes minute by minute
Including dialogue and emotions of her characters!"
Audiobook
"A great read, but much more procedural and slower-paced than some of her more popular novels like In the Woods."
Love this mystery series set in Ireland. I really felt like I was walking the streets of Dublin with Antoinette and Steve trying to solve this crime. Tana French leads you down many possible avenues until you get to actual resolution. My only complaint is I think the ending went on for too long once you discovered who the murderer was.
I struggled initially with this book but I am happy I stuck with it. Numerous twists and turns.
Another Tana banger
I love books about Ireland and the lovely Irish people. Very creative mystery.
Tana French non delude mai.
The end result made much of the frustration with the characters and their situation worth it. Really didn’t want to see Annette get screwed over by the squad 
"read 450 pages in less than 24 hours, gripping read, surprising twist, great writing"
This was a nicely written murder mystery set in a private girl’s school in Dublin. The author captures teenage angst and friendship while propelling us through a murder investigation. 
Another great read by Tana French.
"Dynamite! If this is the last we will hear of the Dublin Murder Squad, I'm sure going to miss them."
"Another enjoyable installment in the Dublin Murders franchise, with a much greater focus on the internal machinations of the Murder Squad than in early books. All Tana French's strengths - interesting characters, an excellent plot and an expert reveal are all present here, however the story gets a bogged down halfway by excessive detail. I managed to guess the ending fairly early as well, which might say something about French's use of red herrings to drive the narrative."
Turns out THIS was my favorite one!
The people want a Book 7 starring Fleas! 
Audible. Stellar performance by Hilda Fay! 
"4.5/5 as it was a bit slow in the beginning, but loved the ending of this one. My favorites were definitely The Secret Place and Broken Harbor of this series. "
"To be sure, it dragged on a bit, but I enjoyed the characters and the lingo."
"Read this one for book club. Would never have guessed it was the second book in a series. Unlikeable main character, but the story was interesting and stuck with me. "
I think I'll have to read the rest!
I finally finished the last in this series. This was a good one. 
"After re-reading the entire series in 2021, I think this one might be my favorite."
Always enjoy Tana French books!
Solid Tana. Gotta love those Dublin murderers
Great murder mystery
Absolutely loved this story! The twists making you second guess. And the accents on the audiobook were awesome.
Probably my favorite in the series. I hope French gets back into this series!!
"Liked the dialog. It kept me guessing. But, at points I wanted it to get to the point."
I have enjoyed all of the Tana French books.
Solid. Some funny lines. Good showdown. Characters you either want to pat on the shoulder or punch in the teeth.
"I really enjoyed the setup and characters in the book. The pace dragged for me, especially in the back half.

But I will note this series as one to continue!"
"It didn't have the magic of In the Woods or The Secret Place, but I really loved how she ended it. Conway and Moran are probably my two favorite characters she's created. Compelling read."
So long but worth it in the end. I really love Tana French’s writing.
Getting out of a reading slump in the only logical way - through dense Irish crime fiction! 
Great book. I love Tana French. She has amazing character building. 
"Antoinette is my favorite D, so far. I like how it closed out the series."
I think this is one of my favorites of this series so far. I was really rooting for the underdog detectives.
"Great book, couldn't put it down!"
Love this author!
Likeable flawed the characters
3.5*
"Excellent, probably the best of the series"
I difficult book exploring the challenges of a professional woman working in the hostile world of male detectives and has you guessing all the way through
Good one start to finish.
Good story but soooo looonngg.
"3.5
Liked the characters a lot but felt some scenes were dragged out and had just a few too many details than necessary."
"Great interrogation scenes. Intense all the way through. A bit too long for me, but it still held my interest right to the end."
"Possibly my favorite of hers, or at least right now it is."
4.5+ Definitely the best in the series. So glad I didn’t give up after the first two. 
"Sort of sad to be finished with The Dublin Murder Squad series. Tana French is a wonderful writer. Couldn't put this down, though the ending was a little too twisty-turny to feel totally real.
"
Highly recommend the audio version. Convoluted plot with good characters.
Love an Irish 
"Another really good police procedural from Tana French. The characters weren't as likeable, I didn't get to know them as well as some of her other books, but overall still enjoyable. "
I rate this 3.75. Parts of the plot are incredulous. I didn't understand everything that happened - but it was suspenseful and overall I enjoyed reading it.
Somehow I've reached the end of the Dublin Murder Squad series and now I don't know what to do! Tana French must keep writing.
Gotta love Antionette.
"Happy October, she’s just so good. "
Another mystery that kept me guessing at how to fit all the pieces together. I’ve enjoyed French’s Dublin Murder Squad series and am hoping another book comes out soon!
"i am so sad to say goodbye to the dublin murder series but this was a great way for it to end. thank you, tana french!"
Solid complicated plot with plenty of twists. Didn't see the end coming.
Listened 4.5
"450 pages - read in two days. Couldn't put it down! And, a week later, can't remember what it was about without a reminder. But a darn good read!"
The best Tana French book I have read!
One slightly improbable key to the story but very insightful.
Her books are always excellent.
"This book spins you in circles a bit, but I think that’s the intention since that’s what the detectives were experiencing. A bit too long but a good story. I really like the way the author story tells and the book is easy to follow."
Last book of the year!
I really enjoyed this. 
"Tana French Is a favorite of mine. This is not her best book, but even so it’s a great read. "
"When is the next one out? Love these books - rich in detail, completely unable to put down."
4+ stars. Favorite I've read of the series so far.
"Best one of the series, hands down. "
"French makes her characters so real that, by the end, I knew them better than my neighbors. She writes dialogue brilliantly. My only criticism: too many words by about 40 pages. "
Female detective and her young male partner-twisty turning murder investigation. Impressive ending.
"Good prose. Great story. Deeply unlikable protagonist. She came around, but not enough. "
"While I love Tana French’s writing style immensely, this particular story was too much conjecture and not enough movement of the plot for me to enjoy it as much. "
Amazing narrator. Amazing audiobook performance. Wonderful story kept me hooked. But gosh dang it this author doesn’t tie up every loose end!!! So only 4 instead of 5. 
Another great murder mystery by Tana French.
"She’s back, baby! "
"Not much of a mystery fan but I enjoyed this one just not all 500+ pages. It was the right kind of book for me in Feb., 2023. "
No more Tana French for me. The story is very real but so long with few highlights. The writing is first class but stays even paced with few highlights.
finally caught up on this series! it’s just so good. i love tana french’s writing style and character development and all the fun irish slang i’ve learned along the way 
I love the audible version with the narrator’s Irish. Great mystery. 
This crime novel was well written but just too long for me. I made it more than halfway through and just wanted to move on to another book. I figured out who did it.
"Not my favorite of the series but some of the best interviews of the whole series for sure! Love Conway and Moran duo, it’s one of the better partnerships too. All the other stories (besides in the woods I think??) had Frank as a character or a reference is my main reason for loving them more."
"Really enjoyed the writing, even if I did not understand all of the colloquialisms used by the characters. I would definitely read another Tana French book."
This story of the Dublin Murder Squad was a bit all over the place in terms of the crime story. I loved it for the character development of the detectives. 
the author never ceases to amaze me. an excellent ending
I just love Tana French and will read anything she writes. 
B- Audible 
A slow start but the second half was gripping. I made any excuse possible to just keep reading!
"Solid finish to a series I’ll remember fondly, even with really shaky installments for #s 4 and 5. "
"After four really good Dublin murders and one that left me flat, number six is a darn good mystery, with plenty of twists and turns. "
"Memorable characters, great plot, and a satisfying ending kept me glued to the pages. My first venture into a Tana French novel."
I think this was my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series. I like how these characters meshed. The most drawn out characters of the series in my opinion. 
"Dopo la fatica fatta per finire 'The Secret Place', meno male. "
Antoinette needed Ted Hastings then we would have been sucking diesel!!
Good mystery. Confusing at times but cleared up as it progressed. 
Tana French is one of my favorite authors and I liked this book very much. 
"A ping pong novel






I really enjoyable this sixth murder squad novel. It novel gets more interesting than the one before it. I hope Ms. French writes many more.





"
Good mystery. Woman cop main character as murder detective. Much bad cop language. I've liked all the audio books by this author.
Another good mystery from Tana French. Could have consolidated the story line a bit but it kept my attention. 
4.5/5 stars :)
Not a bunny boiler but lovely.
"Very interesting, and I love all the details woven in, but sometimes it just gets too loooong to hold my attention. "
Always enjoy this series
"Like the writing style, mystery seems realistic, a bit padded in length"
I definitely liked this one. Good twist. Didn’t see that end coming. 
"This of course is exactly the type of book I like. Bent coppers, a gaff who runs the show but it was a little slow to start. It finally held my attention about half way through! "
"Murder squad never disappoints

It’s been awhile since I’ve read a Murder Squad book and I realized how much I enjoy them. Good strong characters and plenty of twists and turns"
I always love this book series. I debate about giving it 5 stars since I was not expecting the twist but it really drug on. The interview sections were so dam long. 
Audiobook - listened with hubby so it took awhile to get through but we loved the ending.
"wild ride, hope we get some more soon "
"Another solid 4-star read from Tana French! Hilda Fay's narration is stellar.

17 July 2023 - Clearly, I am on a Dublin Murder Squad jag. I finished Broken Harbor, and I gave myself the better part of the day to decide whether or not I should jump in and finish the series. Clearly the answer is YES."
"I had been told this volume was the best in the series. I doubt that, but it was entertaining enough, like a TV show. "
I found Conway to be a remarkable character.
"I really enjoyed this story, and the writing was right up my alley. Also loved the audiobook narrator’s Irish accent. "
Enjoyed it a lot. Got kind of wordy in places but I just skimmed over them without losing the gist of the story.
I love Tana French and I was so hooked on this series. So sad that it’s over.
Hard to catch up with Irish Lingo
Really developed the characters.
"Good novel about police procedures. It got a little tedious with all the details, but I guess that's how it is in the force."
This was my first Tana French book but it won’t be my last. I loved the main character and found it fascinating that the author included the thought process of the detectives. 
sixth consecutive winner of the tana french award for most palatable copaganda
"Good, intriguing murder-mystery set in Dublin. Since it's written in the first person, the dialect was fun to decipher and get the hang of. Bleedin' deadly, it was.
"
"Добротний ірландський детектив від знаної авторки. Не найулюбленіша з моїх книг у неї, але дійсно класна."
Good mystery. A couple of times I was sure that it was going to be solved very soon and then looked at how many more pages were left.
Many twists and turns. Cool getting the detective’s viewpoint and thoughts. I got stuck in the middle a bit. 
Good account of psychological game-playing. Many levels of deceit and delusion.
"Me pareceu um final bonito para a série, com eles tendo a amizade que Rob e Cassie não puderam ter. Gostei como a escrita dela sempre faz o coração acelerar nos últimos capítulos. "
Great way to end the series with Antoinette
Fun fast read. French writes from the perspective of her detectives in a very convincing manor.
Was reading for a second time. Still good.
Entertaining and relatively quick. 
Very fun who dun it! One of my faves from Tana French
"Another great yarn from her. A black Irish detective facing misogony to both her, and the victim of the crime she is investigating. Great read as always. "
"Such a good writer. Loved the theme of the stories we tell ourselves and others, and how reality does or does not fit with those stories. "
Her gaff was thick walled and low ceilinged. “It fits me just about right.”
"Overall good plot, it feels like you're testing theories as the characters come up with them."
"Probably my least favorite of the Dublin murder squad. Not sure if it’s because of the main character. That said, still a great book. Love the depth she puts into her stories. "
Just a spectacular story. 
antoinette conway my beloved 😵‍💫
A Tana French novel with a satisfying ending? I can't believe it.  It did drag at parts but overall I liked it. I liked the parallel in between Aislinn and Antoinette. 
"3.5 Overall - 4 for the storyline, 3.0 for the amount of time some of the conversations, scenes, plots, or chapters carried on. I was eager for the story to move along to find out what happened."
"Complex, brilliant, agonizingly tense. The ending is a redemption. The reader works almost as hard as the detectives."
Such a good book! The series is amazing.
Our fearful thoughts have the power to blind us to what is really going on.
"To me, a return to form after The Secret Place. We have another shot with Conway and Moran here (their relationship is one of the better features of The Secret Place) and this one moves. "
"Not my typical genre, but the right book at the right time and included a message I needed to hear, so thanks to T.F. (oddly not the author) for somehow figuring all that out."
"Pretty good. Better than The Witch Elm, which I just finished, but not as good as In the Woods."
Never mind. The app has suddenly crashed on me three times in a row. I liked it. Let's see if I can save this review 
Imagine a cop being involved in your death and trying to hide his involvement from his mates... what's done in the dark ALWAYS comes to light.
Audiobook 
"A satisfying “end” to the series. Another crime/mystery novel perfectly paced by French. Commentary on the stories that we tell ourselves, the fantasies we believe and how they can lead us astray. "
"This took me forever to read, and was honestly kinda boring but… I still liked it! "
"As usual Tana French does a great job of creating main characters that you want to read about and follow. This book was decent, though the end was unsatisfying in my opinion."
First time reading Tana French and thoroughly enjoyed her writing and the story - will put her books on my “to read” list.
"Tana French puts together a really good police procedural, with some fine, fleshed-out detectives on the job. Love that it’s set in Dublin. It’s so good."
"This felt different from the other Dublin Murder series and the protagonist was truly unlikeable, but Ms French is such a good writer that it all resolved and was a excellent read. "
Good but too long
"pickup from ridge thrift, devoured while waiting for lib to give me back the fish book. guess what I’m gonna do now on train home (read anotha tana french) "
"While this was not my fav from French, it was still a joy to read. I adore her writing and story telling styles"
Good story with a strong female protagonist but would have enjoyed more if not so long! Quite a bit of repetitive detail. 
"Similar to other Dublin Squad books… murder or mayhem, investigation ensues, and something’s not quite right. However I still enjoyed this book. Had me second guessing everything! "
This author just has too many words for the stories she writes. The last 100 pages are good !
Listened to audiobook 
Solid. Satisfying. I like these two together. 
"Quite a return to form for this series, after the book 3, 4 and 5 were all below expectations.
It’s not as good as the likeness but easily #3 in the Dublin murder squad series"
"Great redemption for Antoinette! I enjoyed the pace and perspective from this story. So sad to be caught up on the series, every single book was excellent."
Good ending to the series!
"I liked the many layers of this one, focusing as much on the detectives as on the case itself."
It went on a little too long but I enjoyed the basic plot
"While the story is intriguing, it took forever to get through. The chapters are VERY long, live 40ish pages. It felt like it moved so much slower than her other books."
3.5 rounding up because tana french is always solid - very procedural but still enjoyable
Tana is my favorite. But she can get a little long-winded at times.
A good read didn't like at first. I keep reading the book and it got a lot better. First time reading this author. 
"Gripping read! Loved it, truly a page turner I was unable to put down!"
Excellent easy read 
"French always writes a tight detective novel. This one dragged a bit, but still a good read."
"Her books are so unique because there is so much detail, they move through each day slowly - yet keep me engrossed. Interesting character development in the lead detective in this one. "
"This was like reading an episode of Law & Order from Olivia Benson's perspective, but in an Irish brogue"
"For a book with such an unlikable protagonist and almost no action, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this 4.4⭐️"
Finally! A return to form. This one was great.
"loved getting more of antoinette and steven but this was definitely the weaker of the two for me. i wasn’t as obsessed with this one, but the last 20% was unputdownable "
really liked it
"The story held my interest, a good mystery. Unfortunately, portraying the protagonist as a tough girl with a paranoid mean streak became monotonous."
4.5 stars. A well paced crime book 
some light journalism slander but i finished this 450 page book in under 12 hours so clearly i can forgive that
Gripping fast moving complicated with twists and turns.
"What the heck am I gonna read for fun now
8/10"
3.5 but round up
"In all honesty, I couldn’t put it down! At times I thought there were too many small details but it was great character development. "
Solid detective procedural. Tana French does a better job than most authors in this genre of character development. Love that it's set in Ireland. Enjoyed the entire series.
My review - no spoilers!
Maybe my favorite French title to date. 
French carries off another complicated and brilliant story.
One of Tana's best!
well-crafted....each step by step along the way of the plot.
Good page turner!
The mind games of the Dublin murder squad.
Very good detective fiction with surprise ending. Very enjoyable book. 
Very good book. Not the best of her six books. I'm not sure which is my favorite. :)
Well-written but slow-moving. Not sure I really liked the main character at all. 
A great page turner! 
Another winner by Tana French. Couldn't put it down.
Excellent installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series.
The Irish slang was a little difficult at first but I got used to it. The story was intriguing.
"A little drawn out and a tad predictable, but an overall good read. "
Good!!!!
"Great characters, great ending!"
Could not put this down. A great crime mystery! 
Despite the indication this is #6 in a series it stands on it's own. 
Maybe one of my favorites by French. 
Really liked the plot and character dynamic. It was complicated and kept moving right until the end. 
"Fan of Tana French

I’ve read all of Tana French’s book. They stay with you long after the last page because her characters are so believable and complex. This book is about a murder but also about the detectives and their relationships to each other."
Good one
Good twisty plot
Another great mystery from Tana French. The main characters are realistic and you believe them. Lots of twists and turns. You think you know whodunit but then you don’t.
To be in the mind of an exceptional detective made for a great read!
"Knížka se mi dobře četla, hlavní hrdinka mi nebyla nesympatická. Rozuměla jsem jí, v mládí si asi užila svý. A kdo je vetřelec?"
"Audible book. Good, solid read. I really liked the nuanced description of evaluating other people. Loved the Irish accents. I think I am gradually becoming an Anglo irish phile. Hmmm I probably should inspect that trend more carefully. In any case, a solid, captivating detective novel. My first Tana French book. She is prolific and a solid writer. Still, there is a lot to cover before I die. I dont think I will circle back to any more of her books. Not that I didnt like the book but that greater wisdom can be found elsewhere.  "
"Tara French is so good, "
Interesting and somewhat frustrating female protagonist (who identifies her blind spots late in the book). Another well done murder tale that focuses more on the characters than the act.
"This is the last book in the Dublin murder series. Tana French is becoming one of my favorite writers. I really enjoy how detailed the characters and personality descriptions are, whether they play a major or minor roll. Makes the scenes easy to play out in your mind. This book keeps you on your toes and I enjoyed trying to solve the latest murder as the book unfolds!"
"Uno di quei libri che, una volta iniziati, non si riesce più a mettere giù. Ma, dopo aver letto ""Il collegio"", da questa autrice non mi aspettavo niente di diverso. Personaggi realistici e ricchi di sfaccettature, storia ben costruita, atmosfere perfette: c'è tutto quello che non può mancare a un thriller/noir come si deve."
"A retired policeman from the States comes to Ireland to repair a rural cottage and live a solitary life, but is drawn into a mystery and into the lives of the people in the nearby village. Excellent characterization and depiction of place. One good surprise midway through. Well plotted."
"Finally another murder squad book. This one involves a couple of newer agents, given and murder case which is complicated by a senior detective's involvement. Enjoyed this book, but feel her earlier books are better, ore twists and turns in the plot."
"I read on a blog that it doesn't really matter what order these books are read in. I kind of wish that I had started at the beginning though. I wasn't confused about the characters or the events that took place, but I still think it would have been better to read them in order. I liked that a lot of the suspense in this story was from interrogations. That is not a common occurrence in the other books in this genre that I read. I thought it was well done. I listened to the audiobook and hearing it with the Irish accent of the woman who read it added charm and depth to the story. "
"I found myself thinking that I wasn't enjoying this as much as French's other novels, until I realized it's because French is so good at character--Antoinette Conway's head is an uncomfortable place to be. The story is somewhat typical but feeling it through Conway as narrator makes it fresh and adds an interesting dynamic. Sometimes we can't get out of our own way, can we?"
"I'm such a fan of this series. The writing is smart, easy, and believable. "
"French is the PD James of the 21st century. Smart, character AND plot driven mystery novels that don't get bogged down in contrivance or cleverness. Here she gets in the head of a brilliant yet anxious and insecure detective in a way that I find imminently relatable. French drives the novel on the fact that when the head spins in unproductive thought patterns, logic goes out the window - especially ironic in a mystery novel! The ending is pat in a way that I liked less than the more ambivalent ""resolutions"" of some of the other novels but, nonetheless, well worth the time of anyone who likes literary crime fiction. "
"oooh - another stellar story from Tana French! Damn, she's a clever, smart writer....
highly recommend - 4.5 stars"
Detective Conway is by far one of my most favorite characters - tough and smart. Doing her job despite colleagues. Interesting plot and never lost interest for the who done it. 
I was so glad to return to the Dublin Murder Squad for another adventure. This one was one of her best yet and I didn't want to put it down.
I've had this one sitting in my tbr pile for longer than I'd care to admit. Despite being book #6 in the series I didn't feel like I was missing anything by having not read the first five. The pace seemed really slow for the majority of the book but overall I enjoyed the ending as I wasn't able to guess the killer at any point. 
"i really enjoyed this book! i found the ending shocking and satisfying. there were a lot of twists and turns that kept me guessing. french does a good job of getting into the real life aspects of case work. story was slow towards the middle, which is why i knocked off one star."
"This book leans towards 4.5 stars.

I'm a huge fan of Tan French and am now up to date with her Dublin Squad series, which I'm really excited about. The previous book ""The Secret Place"" was not as engaging as her books usually are, and I wonder if I read it again, after reading the Trespasser, there will be more interest, given that the protagonists are the same to an extent. But it was also good to read reviews that most people found The Secret Place as the least favorite of the series.

But picking up The Trespasser after years of not reading her books, was an incredible journey of her familiar character development, detailed narrative and engaging dialogue. It was incredible! I can't wait for her to write the next one in this series."
"The Trespasser by Tana French is book 6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series. It takes place no long after the events of The Secret Place, book 5 in the series. The Trespasser also features the same two detectives as were in The Secret Place, something of a rarity for Tana French novels as the feature character in one novel is often a bit player in a prior one. In The Secret Place the tale is told through the eyes and voice of young Detective Stephan Moran who sees the murder as an opportunity to break into the Murder Squad. In The Trespasser, the tale is told through the eyes and voice of his partner, Detective Antoinette Conway, the lone female in the male dominated Murder Squad.

""...Forget the hit to your social life: the real reason everyone hates night shift is that nothing good ever comes in. The high-profile murders with complex backstories and fascinating motives might happen at night, sometimes, but they don't get discovered till morning. The only murders that get noticed at night are by drunk arseholes whose motive is that they're drunk arseholes...""

When Detective Antoinette Conway fast tracked her career from the Academy, through Undercover, then Missing Persons and then to the Murder Squad she thought she had it made. Only the Murder Squad was nothing like she expected. The alienation, the lack of confidence, the pranks and the harassment as she tried to make herself respected in this male dominated world. At times it seems like the only person she can trust is her own partner, Stephan Moran, but she knows that soon enough, even Moran will want to fit in with the Squad and then she will be alone, an outsider to their world. Antoinette is strong and battle hardened but even she has had enough and the possibility of a lucrative career outside the Force is calling to her. But can she leave all she has worked so hard for behind?

The next case that falls into their lap seems simple enough. A lover's quarrel that ends with a beautiful young girl beaten to death. Nothing about the victim calls out that this is anything else.

Aislinn Murray is a pretty, blond, very well groomed young woman. Her dead body is found next to a table set for a romantic dinner. Everything points to a crime of passion but Antoinette is not entirely convinced. She is sure she has seen Aislinn somewhere before. But Antoinette and Stephan are being shadowed by another Detective. A senior Detective whose mission it seems is to make sure nothing goes wrong on this investigation. This is another example to Antoinette of the lack of trust her boss has in her. Arresting Aislinn's new boyfriend seems to be the quick and simple remedy and what is expected. But Antoinette is not so sure, there seems to be more to this than what appears on the surface and Antoinette has never been someone who does well when she is pushed to do something she does not believe in. Besides, there is something about Aislinn that keeps bothering her.

""...Whoever did this...it's like he killed a little kid: someone who never even had a chance to get her life started. He took away her whole entire life...""

Now Antoinette is sure that there is more to this murder than what meets the eye, but the pressure to wrap it up quickly is bearing down on her. Are her instincts off? Who can she trust? Or is all this just another attempt to make her leave the Squad.

The Trespasser is as much a tale of a young woman fighting for her place in a male dominated world as it is about the violent murder of a young woman. You are never sure if all the slights and the harassment Antoinette is going through are real or just a part of her growing paranoia. Perhaps it is her training as an undercover operative but Antoinette has definite issues with trust and always senses that others have ulterior motives in their actions. While that suspicious mind may help her in working her cases, it has made her very difficult to deal with as part of a team. Thus alienating her from the other Detectives even more.

Antionette is a compelling character, as conflicted as she is determined. At times it is only her own stubbornness that keeps her part of the Squad. An unwillingness to allow the men to drive her out. But as the tale progresses you get the sense that so much of the feeling of oppression she feels is brought on by her own self. A powerful need to self destruct that comes as much from her desire to show up others as her own past.

Her young partner Stephan Moran is devoted to her but even he is worn thin by her paranoia. He knows that the longer her stays by her side, the more damage will be done to his own career.

And then there is the dead body. A simple apparent crime of passion that has the capacity to balloon into a career destroying blunder.

The Trespasser is a tense drama that plays out to a stunning and sad end.

Another good novel by French.

"
"3.5/5 - Somehow this has been my least favorite of her books though it seems, overwhelmingly, to be a favorite of many. Of course, the writing is great and characters are well-developed but I just didn't connect with any of them as much as I have in the past. Antoinette frustrated me a lot of the times and the victim wasn't terribly sympathetic either.

In fairness, it took me a lot longer to finish this one than normal because of a busy week. Maybe the time in between readings had a negative impact for me. Still good just not my favorite."
The fact that I will actually be in Dublin this coming June probably had some influence on my enjoyment in this book but there was a whole lot of additional reasons as well. The characters were quite interesting and very well developed and the plot had enough twists and turns to keep the reader's interest level high. I have read other novels by this author and consider her quite good. Suffice it to say nothing at all in this very good mystery novel did anything to dissuage me of that opinion.
"Engaging, a page turner, ending does not disappoint. Characters well defined, eliminate more of non mystery-personal life-character engagements."
"Another stellar entry in Tana French's excellent Dublin Murder Squad series. This one centers around the death of a young attractive woman who appears to have been killed by a violent punch to the head, and based 0n initial evidence, probably by someone she knew. Two murder squad investigators, Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran, are handed what looks to be an easy to solve case, however things are not as simple as they seem. The prime suspect, the victim's recent boyfriend, isn't completely forthcoming, but Conway and Moran don't ""like"" him for the crime. And pressure from other members of their squad cast suspicions in unexpected ways. I might have rated the book higher, but in this entry protagonist Conway has such a chip on her shoulder it sometimes makes it difficult to root for her. As with her other mysteries, author French includes skillful twists and turns blurring the lines between her heroes and villains, and manages to bring the novel to a highly satisfying close."
"As with every Tana French, I stayed up til 3 AM to finish this."
Enjoyed this much more than the last Tana French I read. Antoinette and Moran are great characters who I really felt for despite their flaws and the plot twists kept me on my toes. Not sure why this novel felt so different than the previous one in the series for me. Some of the same feelings...it does tend to drag with really long investigative/interview scenes but I read it on a Kindle so perhaps I noticed the length less because of that.
"This is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series and as always, Tana French continues to deliver. While it wasn't my favorite in the series so far, that's not to say that it wasn't amazing. The writing was extraordinary. As with the other books, the focus isn't so much on the mystery of the murder itself as it is on the characters and their development. The characters are intelligent and complex and it's fascinating to delve into their minds. The melancholy, creepy atmosphere that is Tana French's trademark, is present in this book as well. I look forward to reading her next book because I know without a doubt that it will be amazing. "
"Lots of insight into detective thinking, or so it seems to an outsider. And even better into the rough Ms Conway's head at the same time. Effectively done. A couple of missteps, but they worked out in the end, so probably not ""mis"" after all. "
"Entertaining, much better than In the Woods which I found really obviouus both as to plot and characters"
"The Trespasser is a book about daughters whose lives have been shaped by their missing fathers. It is also the sixth book in Tana French's series of mysteries about the Dublin Murder Squad.

A young woman named Aislinn Gwendolyn Murray is found murdered in her home. The principal detective on the case, who is also the narrator of the book, is Antoinette Conway, another young woman. They initially seem to have little in common, but they share one thing; Antoinette has never known her father and Aislinn's father disappeared when she was only nine. Was this important to them? Well, the first sentence of The Trespasser is Antoinette saying, ""My ma used to tell me stories about my da.""

Aislinn's life has been largely based on her reaction to her missing father. Antoinette has become a woman who has largely overcome her feelings about her father. But she now has a slew of substitute fathers. Antoinette is the only woman on the Murder Squad. Some of the others ignore her; some torment her; all judge her. A detective named Breslin has been assigned to work with her on this case. At one point, Breslin, speaking to Antoinette and a suspect, actually uses the phrase, ""Who's your daddy?""

Of course, there is much more to the story. The dead girl's new-ish boyfriend is a possible suspect, but Antoinette and her partner Stephen Moran come up with other possibilities, most of which I found rather far-fetched 
including the one that proves to be correct. Ms. French's readers are by now used to outrageous coincidences and most will, presumably, not mind large improbabilities.


Ms. French's narrators continue to sound convincing to me. Her dialogue is quite wonderful (as always).

I should add that some Goodread's reviewers for whom I have great respect love this book. I think it is quite good but flawed."
Not a huge fan of the narrator but loved the ending.
"This is my favourite of the Dublin murder squad books so far, because I love a good book with a subplot of a strong woman working in a male-dominated field, hm, I wonder why. I also always love lady characters who can throw as much shit as the men, and Antoinette Conway fits that bill to a tee. Plus, murder! We love murder books!"
Well developed characters in a detailed detective focused whodunnit. Excellent writing and pacing. Plenty of twists and turns but none of them unbelievable. Nothing too gory or dark.
Absolutely love this series.
"I listened to this on audio, which was a great pleasure.

The is not a look at the pretty side of Ireland.

The interaction between Antoinette and her partner Stephen is very likable. The harassment Antoinette experienced at the hands of the other members of her squad is infuriating!

I have read books one and six in this series. I need to go back and read the rest."
"I am a huge Tana French fan. She always manages to hit the trifecta: truly excellent writing, well developed characters and great plots. The Trespasser is no exception. This one is a true murder mystery, a bit more character focused than her last novels. It also lacked the “creepiness” factor that the last few have had. The Secret Place and Into the Woods remain my favorites, but this one gets a solid 4/5. "
Solid detective story with a damsel in distress a few corrupt cops.
I really enjoyed this one. The characters' angles really draw you in and are hilarious. Tana always renews my love for all-nighters and caffeine! Did not see what was coming at all.
"This was so good. It delves into the history of one of the detectives mentioned in several other books (Likeness, Secret Place). The language is ROUGH, but French's character development and storylines are just terrific. It is a rare murder mystery where I laugh out loud at some descriptions and dialogue, but French manages it. My only problem is now I'm out of murder squad books to read. Anyone who knows Tana French, lock her somewhere and feed her well so she can crank out another one quickly!"
Love everything she does. Nobody does crime fiction better these days. 
Page-turner. Loved all the Irish-isms. 
"I like Tana French books. Unconventional female police characters, twists and turns. Set in Ireland adds additional interest. "
Liked how book went straight into the agenda -murder and liked how it gave insight into the work police teams do and how easy it is to judge the event without having the evidence to substantiate your view
"As a fan of Tana French, this book didn’t disappoint. French weaves crime stories together with many twists and turns, and she has an expert way of revealing pieces of the story as just the right time. Much of the story is obtained through interrogation and the different strategies used when interviewing different players. Detective partners Conway and Moran complement each other nicely. My only complaint was that I thought the “everyone is against me” attitude on behalf of Conway was a bit tiring. I look forward to reading her next book."
"Gostei muito! Tinha adorado outro livro da Tana French - ""Desaparecidos"" e parti para esta leitura com grandes expectativas. É um policial bem pensado, com personagens giras e um enredo dinâmico. Tenho outro livro dela ""O Sítio Secreto"" que vou ler daqui a uns tempos 😎"
"I've loved Tana French's other books, particularly Faithful Place and Broken Harbour, so this one is a tiny bit of a letdown. Don't get me wrong: this is an excellent book, but I didn't fall in love with the protagonist like I have with all the others. Antoinette was interesting as the partner of Stephen Moran in the last book, and I looked forward to getting inside her head and learning what made her tick, but I didn't feel like I ever really did. That's kind of a letdown after Frank Mackey and Scorcher and Moran, especially. Still, the story is great. I wanted to figure it out, and I did, but there were still little details I didn't get right. "
"This is one awesome book. Being a woman in today's society, I was very drawn to this story. The writing is heavily based on dialogue. However, that is what makes the book interesting because Tana French is very descriptive. You get to know every character in this book through the way they speak and their actions. It is almost as if you are standing in the room watching them interact. Great reading start to 2017 for me."
Just as intriguing/interesting as earlier French books.
"I am definitely hooked on Tana French. I found this novel to be a real page-turner. She does such a great job on characterization, and her plot is thought provoking. She does get a bit long at times. "
"Jag har ju sagt det tidigare, men jag säger det igen: Jag är så glad att jag, egentligen mot bättre vetande, fortsatte läsa den här serien efter att jag hade blivit besviken på den första delen. Inkräktare är sjätte boken. För ovanlighetens skull så stämmer det där med fristående delar, även om huvudpersonen i denna förekom även i den förra, men fallen har inget med varandra att göra.

Det har tagit mig några böcker, men med denna så kan jag se ett tydligt tema. Jag tyckte först att det påminde väldigt mycket om det i Otrygg hamn. Sedan slog det mig att det påminner om temat i alla böckerna. Egentligen handlar det inte så mycket om själva brottet, som brukar vara en ganska enkel intrig trots allt, utan mer om den utredande polisens kamp mot sina demoner.

Inkräktare är en spännande bok, om man gillar utredningar, med en riktigt deprimerande och lite läskig historia. Den är på tok för lång, men underligt nog så funkar det ändå.

OBS! Detta är en kraftigt förkortad text. Hela finns på min blogg"
It took a while for me to get into it but the second half was really good. It felt really fucking real and really fucked up. 
" This is a great mystery/police procedural for those who enjoy multiple theories, dead ends, red herrings and detailed speculation about almost every aspect of a crime and the suspects. Set against a background of sordid (but realistic) office politics, the writing includes complex layers of plot and characters peppered with British slang (I now know the difference between ""gaff"" and ""gaffer"", but only guessed at some other words unfamiliar to me and the Kindle dictionary). This was kind of a challenging read for me, but I found it well worth the effort."
"This is my first Dublin Murder Squad book and there were times while listening to this book that I thought ""I don't think I'll read another one."" I was so conflicted about this book - I really liked it - and then it seemed a little slow - and then I really liked it. Back and forth. Back and forth. But at the same time - I'm totally giving this a 4 star rating. I ended up really, really liking this book and intrigued with this series. I have no doubt I will be reading/listening to more of the Dublin Murder Squad. "
"DUblin murder series- Detective is investigating a murder that has happened, someone in her department did it"
"Excellent book. As an avid reader of Tana French, I found this to be her best to date."
Another good murder mystery from Tanna French. I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator gave a stellar performance. Highly recommended.
"I love Tana French books. This one took too long to get to the heart of the actual plot. But it gave sharp insight into the narrating character, only the second female narrator in the series, and that was worth it."
"Tana French makes the reader take a dive in the psyche of Antoinette Conway, the only female detective on the Murder Squad. Her afflictions, worries, introspections, her relationship with her parents, friends, Squad members are all laid bare for the reader to examine and sympathize with.
Likewise, the reader slowly peels away the layers in which Aislinn, the murdered victim, has covered herself in to live a certain life. There is so much more to humans than just their external appearances. Conway is more than a formidable detective and Aislinn, more than a dressed up barbie doll.

French has narrated one of the most dangerous aspects of living - living in a fantasy. And knowing when to stop is an art not learnt by many.

The book has a touch of humour which make the characters stand apart from any other. I don't think I've ever smiled so much while reading a mystery!"
"Excellent. I've read all of Tana French's books, and I think ""The Trespasser"" is the best yet. The same detective team as in ""The Secret Place,"" but the point-of-view is through Antoinette Conway's eyes this time. I have to say that she is my favorite narrator so far. Feisty, a little paranoid and guarded, she was so alive to me. The case that she and her partner, Stephen Moran, are assigned is interesting and complex, and through the investigation we meet other fully-drawn characters. In some (many) mysteries, I sometimes lose track of characters, but French makes each person she introduces memorable. I stayed up late reading this one and highly recommend it."
"Enjoyed this book, but not as much as some other Tana French novels."
Another stellar novel from Tana French. I loved it as much as all the others and was lucky (?) enough to read it mostly in one breath thanks to a sick day.
"I have not read a lot of modern crime fiction, but I never miss out on Tana French's 'Dublin Murder Squad' series. I was delighted when it finally became available at my library and devoured the whole book over this past weekend.

The Trespasser was another engrossing story in this series, with a murder at its core, that looks like a routine case for the crime solving duo, but may just turn out to be more than they bargained for.

As always, I loved getting immersed into French's writing, but felt that something was missing from this book. Thinking back over the previous installments, what I loved the most, were the way the characters were described, as well as their relationships with each other. Always flawed, sometimes downright unlikable, yet always real and believable. And the relationships among them were brilliantly explored.
I'm not saying this was missing altogether but I didn't feel as engaged with the cast of this book, as I was used to. The brilliance didn't hit me on every page, it just sometimes reared its head.
All up, this was still a fantastic read with a well done crime at its core."
"I always enjoy Tana French's writing. I have a tendency to read and then rank her books and this one is not my favorite. On a list of her books, it would be towards the bottom. If you're familiar with her work, you know that there's normally two mysteries: the murder case at hand, as well as a past unsolved mystery, usually involving the detective narrating the story. I found the backstory mystery slightly disappointing, mostly its resolution (trying to avoid spoilers here), and while the murder itself was very interesting, I pegged whodunit pretty quickly. That said, French is an incredibly talented writer, and the way she unspools a story is great. I'm four-starring this because I did really enjoy it, and the only reason it falls short for me is because I know the author has done so much better in the past. I'll still be buying her next novel the second it comes out. "
"The Trespasser is the sixth Dublin Murder Squad novel that stars Detective Antoinette Conway, a character we got to know first through her now-partner, Steve Moran, in The Secret Place (2014). It's another wonderful novel from Tana French. I've read all of her books and I have fallen in love with the Dublin Murder Squad. They're not perfect human beings and Tana does not shy away from exploring all of their demons - real and imagined.



"
Another solid one. Can't wait for her next. 
"Remember, one reader's spoiler may be another man's simple summary.

The ""noob team"" of Dublin police detectives Antoinette Conway (who's black, gets hit by male peers on a lot, and has developed an ice queen facade in self-defense) and all-round nice guy Stephen Moran plough past the the misdirections in the murder case- which toward organized crime or toward the murder vic's new boyfriend - to identify the actual killer, who has gone to great lengths to hide himself.

The person they single out as prime suspect has the power to do great damage to them.

Sometimes, if a conviction can't happen, the only consolation is to damage the culprit's reputation and career chances.

The turns camaraderie and conflict between the new partners is engrossing, too."
I have read all of this series---and haven't yet forgiven French for failure to solve the introductory crime in her very first book. This one has a lot of narrative and I thought I might give up on it. But glad I didn't. You can read the blurbs on the plot on a lot sites so won't bore you with this here. Takes a bit to learn the Dublin slang but worth the attempt.
"Antoinette Conway has a chip on her shoulder (with good reason), but she takes it to annoying extremes at times, even turning against the most likable character in the story (her partner). As much as I love French's Murder Squad series, this book drags at times--really wish the two chapter-long interrogation scenes had been shortened/cut. I so hated listening to the nasty Breslin and prickly Conway double team an obviously innocent suspect for an interminably long time (twice!), that I was tempted to downgrade the story for those scenes alone. Luckily, the author righted the story at the end and I was able to finish the book with good enough feelings to rate a four-star review."
Very detailed look at the psychology behind a murder inspection. Interesting from that point of view but sometimes difficult to keep interested. Brilliantly written. 
"3.5 stars.
This book was hard to get into, only because I did not like Antoinette, I thought she was irritating and so I couldn't get into her story.
There was a lot of long descriptions that took me out of the experience, but only because it wasn't my cup of tea to read about."
"As with all Tana French books, this one doesn't disappoint. It's a very fast read. I really like the characters in this one, although Steve has a lot more patience with Antoinette than most men would. "
"Tana French does it again. Her detective series are just consistently strong with great character development, dark gritty stories, and suspense that builds throughout. This one was a slow burn, but I really enjoyed it."
"Entry number six in Tana French's exceptional Dublin Murder Squad series is given to us through the perspective of Antoinette Conway, sole female member of the Big Boys Club (the murder detectives.) Conway was a shade too bitchy for my taste the first time I encountered her (in French's last book.) However, The Trespasser was the first book I picked up to numb myself after the election. Seeing as we decided to hire the frat boy most likely to date rape you at a Kappa Kappa Klan kegger, suddenly Conway's acid manner and the chip on her shoulder seem very, very credible to me. I have always tried to be 'Cool Girl' (the persona Conway adapts to put her male suspects at ease during certain interviews) -- but right now is a terrible time to be a woman in America. Some changes are called for and I will have to dust off a persona I have not used regularly since my college days. To quote Elton John, ""The Bitch is Back"".

So this was the right time for me to explore life in the murder squad through Conway's lens. What may have gotten on my nerves a few years ago was actually revving me up with righteous indignation. The Murder Boys, with the exception of Conway's likeable and affable partner, squad newbie, Steve Moran, were rendered mainly as annoying and at times misogynistic background noise. Conway was running the show on this case, or at least attempting to manage her own case. The case is that of the murder of Aislinn Murray, found knocked out on the fireplace hearth in her flat with a head injury that proved fatal. This incident is dished up to Conway and Moran as a probable domestic dispute gone over the top. Disgusted with another garden variety domestic being dumped in her lap while the squad hot shots (all male) take the juicy cases, Conway starts out with her general pissed off attitude. Her attitude is further adjusted (for the worse) by the sudden interference/oversight of Detective Breslin -- a glib and douchie 'toss pot' who imposes himself as an unwanted 'mentor'. French has some fun with Breslin, giving him loads of deadening jargon-speak dialogue. When Conway butts heads with Breslin it is a joy to read.

As with all of French's stories, the psychological mind set of the detective takes on an even greater role than the motivations of the perp. Each detective brings a unique set of baggage to a case, which can greatly color his or her interpretation of events and the story he or she authors about what might have happened. The Trespasser contains many narratives. All are plausible and interesting. It takes the reader to the end of the book to learn which of the stories most closely matches the events as they actually occurred.

Obviously there is more at play here than a standard bit of domestic violence. The Trespasser revolves around a missing person case (from Conway's past life in that department), and the secrets in the victim's life. We also learn a great deal more about Conway and where her issues began. By the end of the story, you always feel that you know all of French's characters quite well. She has a talent for bringing a myriad cast alive with detail. I enjoy psychological suspense and the psychological aspects of her work (both with her detectives and her criminals) is of the highest caliber.

I recommend this title as being much better than her last one, which I felt was French's weakest effort. I feel like she is back on her game. Fans of the series and readers who enjoy a crime story that happens in the head as much (if not more) than on the streets would find The Trespasser well worth their time. As always, I wonder who Tana French might spin out as the main character in her next book. Next time my money is on O'Kelly, the head of the Murder Squad. But I could be wrong! As always, I will tune in next time and look forward to finding out."
"Partners Conway and Moran are given a murder case to solve. Conway is the only woman on the murder squad and takes quite a bit of harassment from her fellow squad members. The story is full of hypotheses about the murder, not coming together until the final pages."
"Tana French tells a great story with believable characters, but she's too wordy."
"She lays the slang really thick in this one. It is a push and pull - you are hooked into the story and want to inhale the book in one sitting, but every page is like a dense forest. Who is a gaffer and what is a gaff? Why is a shower not where you bathe, but someone who shows off? And don't even start figuring out the 'bit' - it could have 15 different meanings. You move through the story and keep wondering - which parts are true and who is lying? Everyone seems to have an agenda. And Antoinette - she is the brave one, but does she have to be? The ending is well worth it, the tangled up ball of clues comes undone just the way everyone deserves."
"Reading a Tana French Dublin Murder Squad series book is always an interesting experience. There are few neat endings, so most of the time you end up feeling like Bruce Banner at the end of an episode of ""The Incredible Hulk,"" hitchhiking away, a little hollowed out, an unresolved chord wedged in your chest. This one, however, delivered something a little closer to what one expects from a crime book, and that made for a nice change.

""Faithful Place"" is still my favorite of the six books by far, but this is another enjoyable offering from this consistent series."
"Definitely my favorite since Faithful Place and The Likeness. I had been disappointed by the way the last two of French's Dublin Murder Squad Series' ended. This was solid, a slow burn, interesting characters, some twists, but mostly, good old fashioned police work, so-to-speak. Good stuff. I hope she sticks to this and not the slightly more paranormal-y stuff from prior installments."
I enjoy all of Tana French's mysteries and this is no exception. Antoinette Conway is a bit crazy but this is good mystery and there's some really funny moments in this book.
Good read---stay alert to follow all the twists and turns.
Found this difficult to get through at times which is probably why it took me so long to get through it. But I continues to read it and overall enjoyed the book very much. 
"Fav author of mine. I love her books. Took me a while to get into this one, though, but when I did... Characters that are so real they could step right off the page, and dialogue that dunks you straight into Dublin streets. "
"This was an excellent crime story. It was realistic, a bit crude but thoroughly plausible. The story is told by it heroine and done in rough Dublin Irish slang and jargon. Many words and phrases I did not understand exactly until I looked them up. I rated it slightly lower because its only flaw was that it seemed to drag on a bit too long in spots. There is a suspect interview passage that was probably 15-20 pages long but could have and should have been done in 10. This was good 'head-drama.'
I plan to continue reading Tana French's works."
"Great, which is to be expected of Tana French by now, but knocking off one star mainly coz it needed more editing - did not have to be this long at all. I do agree with other reviewers that the mystery/solution was a bit obvious but it didn't detract from my enjoyment!"
Solid story and excellent characters but somehow my least favorite of the series.
"back to the dublin castle, the murder squad it houses and tana french completely blowing me away!

this book is told from the perspective of antoinette conway-- she's tough, and the whole squad knows it. being the only girl in an all-boys club, she's been subjected to hazing that borders on cruel, but she's determined to tough it out. at her side is ambitious, agreeable stephen moran (of books 3 and 5) to complement her standoffish personality. their dynamic as partners is extremely refreshing, especially after the previous novel in which it was through the latter's perspective.

the case tells the death of a young woman and all initial evidence they find points to the boyfriend. there's nothing immediately shocking about the case, but through her masterful weaving of both actual clues and red herrings, she has created a mystery that had me on my toes despite it being a bit all over the place. oh, and a bonus: really, nothing ever beats tana french's amazing interrogation room scenes which simply never fail to possess this certain electric charge to it.

the wonderfully complex relationships of the characters is where the novel shines. i've always said that i love these books because they act more like character studies set against a murder case and the same rings true for this one, taking it a step further by dissecting the dynamics of the murder squad itself, be it partner/partner, veteran/rookies, gaffer/subordinates. everyone had their own motivations and tana french does not hold back with her treatment of them, giving the novel an emotional punch aimed to kill.

this felt a lot like a finale. while i would love to read more of the dublin murder squad, i'd be fine if this was the end. i wouldn't say this was her best work (still gotta give it to Broken Harbor) but it's still really, really damn good. forever looking forward to what tana french cooks up next.

a reflection on the dublin murder squad no one asked for 
ok!!! the set-up for this reminded me a lot of In the Woods: we have two main detectives plus a back-up detective they're not entirely sure they trust. the first book ended up being my least favorite, largely because rob and cassie's friendship seemed so contrived to lead up to THAT falling out. it wasn't wholly convincing.

i loved steve and antoinette's relationship because they were actually friends, despite having suspicions about one another. which also brings me to what i absolutely love about the dublin murder squad! it's like tana's had everything planned out carefully. like this partnership was just meant to be, like it was decided the moment frank mackey tried to mess with their heads in The Secret Place,no, before that, when scorcher resigned in Broken Harbor which left an opening for conway to join the squad, further, when moran decided to double-cross scorcher in Faithful Place. goddamn i love tana french so much, why do i have no one to talk to about these brilliant books!!!!!]"
"Enjoyed the read- not sure on how believable the storyline is but good writing and character development. Love the Irish language and city grit. I had no idea about what was really going on until it was revealed... no spoilers. This is the second Tana French book, and I would read more. I did do some skimming through the book which is always a sign that things are draggy. I also felt like the progression of events was not realistic."
"Love Tana French, I've read every one of the Dublin Murder Squad books and can't wait for the next one to come out!"
This was a great story but was way too long -- I had read In the Woods years ago but it seemed much tighter and to the point. Too much analysis and drawn out situations but in the end enjoyable. 
And I have finally finished the series. Love! Review:  A Page Before Bedtime
"Like Tana French's previous five novels in the Dublin Murder Squad series, The Trespasser (Penguin, digital galley) is wonderfully immersive. Detective Antoinette Conway, who appeared in The Secret Place, takes the lead this time, telling how she and partner Steve Moran catch what appears to be a slam-dunk case of domestic murder on a frozen January dawn. Aislinn Murray, 26, looks like Dead Barbie lying on her sitting room floor, the dinner she was cooking for her new beau, Rory Fallon, still on the stove. A mild-mannered bookseller, Rory is the prime suspect, even though he insists Aislinn never answered the door when he arrived for dinner. And he sticks to this story despite intense interrogation by Conway and a more experienced detective, Breslin, brought in on the case by the chief. Conway feels pressured by Breslin to arrest Rory, even though the initial investigation turns up little evidence and a suspicion that more was going on in Aislinn's life than her new fellow. Or is Conway, the only woman on the squad and carrying a chip on her shoulder the size of an oak tree, just being paranoid? How much does her past shape her perspective? Layered like a fancy cake, The Trespasser is a classic case of misdirection and deceit encased in a police procedural. In a recent New York Times story, French said she loved ""character-based books with beautiful writing, plenty of atmosphere, secrets and mysteries.'' Me, too, which is why I love Tana French."
"Bigger on local color than plot. Seems like everyone had a chip on the shoulder. If you read this, be sure to read The Likeness if you haven't already."
The book started out frustrating... the lady deceive seemed like a whiner... but it got better. Seemed like a movie drama.
"I'm a little excited about finding a new author who's writing, characters and settings I really enjoy.
I like the unlikable detective, who becomes more likeable as the story goes on.
This is a gritty, real, and highly enjoyable read.
Looking forward to reading the author's other books!"
"The last book was about Moran and Conway from Moran's point of view, and this one is about Conway and Moran from Conway's point of view, and if Steve Moran would show a little more character, these two could carry a long-running series about murder detectives that I think would make many readers happy.

In the last book, The Secret Place, I was irritated by Conway's tough-guy persona (among other things -- like being in the head of a bunch of catty, petty, teenage girls half the time), so I wasn't entirely sure I would enjoy a book with her as the narrator. This is Steve Moran's third book appearance, and there's not much to dislike about him, but he doesn't have too much going on except his own future plans. Could Antoinette really tell me a story that didn't leave me wanting to smack someone? At first I was pretty fed up with the paranoia and her hyper-vigilance and aggression toward the rest of her squad, but more and more was revealed that illustrated why she was like that, and lo and behold, I'm not entirely sure she shouldn't have been *more* aggressive with them. Once the mystery started unfolding, I was so hooked. It wasn't just whodunnit, it was who can they trust, from their floaters to the other senior detectives to the superintendent. And just when you think it's going to turn into some overdone conspiracy crap, the pieces start to fall into place and the simple boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy accidentally kills girl story is revealed. But how to arrest the guilty party is the challenge.

This book resolves in a way that left me feeling quite good about the closure, though I wasn't so sure right up until the end. French is an author who makes you read to the very last paragraph with the same voraciousness that occurs with the climax, sopping it up like the best soup ever, wanting every drop taken in.

What I think I like most about this series is the narrators and most of the characters are that kind of grayscale good/bad. No one is an angel, does everything right or by the book, and not even the bad guys feel like they're just downright evil. You feel like you not only could know all these people, but maybe, just maybe, there's some of them in you as well. They're edgy, they don't always say or do the right thing, they beat themselves up about mistakes and then bounce back to what they need to be doing. Their heartbreak, rage, determination, and relief is all so palpable, it's like you're right there shadowing them the entire time.

The one and only thing that gets on my nerves consistently is the harassment that goes on in the squad room without any kind of intervention or any protections from those in higher positions. This is consistent throughout all the books, as Superintendent O'Kelly runs a very macho, tough squad. Sure, O'Kelly seems to have the big picture tautly in his control, fighting for the side of right, but the amount of abuse and torment going on is kind of unnerving. If these were historical novels, I'd cut them slack. What it's doing instead is giving me an impression of Ireland that they are way behind the rest of the free world when it comes to allowing women (and men) to work in peace, without being abused by misogynistic, backward, closet-dwelling a'holes. It's getting wearisome.

Otherwise, I find these novels so intriguing, I've gone straight through the series in just a couple months, and find myself sad and impatient, awaiting the next book."
"I liked the voice of Detective Conway a lot but I started getting aware of how often I'm told what to think about a dialogue or a scene that has been described. Telling-after-showing: I don't hate it terribly but even for me, I thought there was too much of that going on.

Closer to the last 3rd of the book, I wondered if that was a deliberate choice. Now that I've finished, I believe it was, but I still feel it didn't need to be done to that degree.

As always, good mysteries and police procedural come with as many twists as a pair of pantyhose left in the dryer with the other clothes. What impressed me more, however, was the dialogues among the detectives and how the solved mystery still held suspense for me because I didn't how how the different detectives involved in the case would play it. I enjoyed that variation on a surprising ending to a mystery.

Not my favorite Tana French but it's still a Tana French and thus engaging and enjoyable."
"This was her best one in a while. I thought it was a great mystery, w/the main murder mystery having a lot of great little sub-plots. "
"I liked the main character, and the Dublin slang was fun. This is an enjoyable book. I will probably read some more in the series."
"So creepy and made me cringe often but the character growth was great, along with an interesting story. I haven't read any others in the series and this stood alone pretty well though I'm sure I would've had a better perspective of the department if I had read 1-5. "
"Another great Tana French novel! This novel opens when a young woman is found dead in her home, and the detective realises she has seen her face before. There are a good amount of red herrings that leave you guessing until the end about what actually happened. The possibility of a fellow police officer, or officers, adds to the intensity and intrigue of the novel. It is told from the perspective of Detective Antoinette Conway, and it is always refreshing to have a crime novel told from a woman’s perspective. It was a bit dull and repetitive at points, but overall was a great read! "
"Although this is 6th in the Dublin Murder Squad series, it was my first Tana French. It was so good I plan on starting with #1 and binge reading her earlier books this summer! This was an audio read enjoyed on the highways and byways, read with the proper Dublin accent I find so appealing, telling such a compelling story, it had me driving around the block to finish a chapter! Her ear for dialogue is pitch-perfect. Her protagonist is a tough, unapologetic detective to whom we could listen forever. This case illustrates loyalty, suspense, the need for and danger of living inside one's head, and character trajectory scenes that sparkle in unexpected ways. Her interrogation room scenes are most compelling.

"
"a wonderfully compelling novel with fascinating, well-drawn characters in the detective squad, among whose interactions are created smaller mysteries as well. the primary detective must get through her own fears, desires, and life to resolve this.. hard to put down and very satisfying as a novel."
"If you've read all of Tana French, then you won't regret reading this one, but if you've never read any of hers, I wouldn't recommend this as the best."
"I have been frustrated by some of Ms French's mysteries over the years. I DO enjoy the complexity of her crimes and the characterization of the detectives. But I find the pace of her storytelling uneven. Sometimes it's a battle to grind through the middle of the book. Thus I was pleasantly surprised to find The Trespasser was an exception. Aside from a slightly tortured back story about Conway's father and ongoing problems with her murder squad colleagues, the pacing was better and the plotline/denouement delivered satisfactorily. Definitely worth the read."
"A bit long (450) but had me enthralled all day til the last page. A young woman is murdered but the two primary detectives working the case are being pressured to railroad the possible perp, or are they just paranoid? The culture of working on a police team, of being the only woman, who can you trust, are you perceptions off....make for a fascinating read. The main character is a salty Irish woman whose one liners are quick and fun"
Another excellent murder mystery from Tana French! I was very satisfied with the ending. 
"Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the Dublin murder squad and her fellow officers are merciless in their harassment – everything from whispering campaigns to urinating in her locker. It has left her angry and more than a little defensive, and she is seriously thinking about leaving for private employment. Her partner Stephen Moran is the only one in the squad who gets along with her and they work well together. Their clearance rate is good enough that they don’t get a lot of grief from their boss.
Coming off a night shift with a case all but cleared, they are handed a new homicide. Somebody has anonymously called in about a young woman struck down in her home, probably dead. The obvious suspect is the new boyfriend who had called at her house, expecting to have dinner with her, only to have his calls and knocks unanswered.
It looks like an easy case, but there are a few things that don’t add up. To begin with, Conway remembers the victim Aislinn Murray asking for police help years earlier, but not the reasons or circumstances. Then her house has been wiped suspiciously clean, not typical for an impulsive attack. The new boyfriend is a fairly weedy bookshop owner with no record of aggressive behavior or police involvement. Conway and Murray are given the “assistance” of a senior officer whose job seems to be to watch them, steer them if they seem to be heading off into territory the brass don’t want checked, and push them for a quick arrest of the bookseller.
It is an excellent procedural – the painstaking examination and re-examination of clues, witnesses, statements and physical evidence. The day to day interactions and rivalries in the department, the personalities of the cops and the gradual unveiling of the victim’s and suspect’s personalities and lives, are all very skillfully done. Murray is a much more complex character than her pretty, shiny surface indicates at first, and this is revealed layer by layer, over time. Conway and Murray’s personalities are a contrast in edginess and accommodation, their relationship is nuanced and complementary. It’s another excellent installment in the series, more literary and character driven than action packed."
"I won this book from GoodReads First Reads.

Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the murder squad. This story is about her finding her place on the squad and solving the case. The case is a young woman found dead in her home after an anonymous tip. The obvious killer is the guy who was coming to dinner, but there is also the mystery boyfriend. Is she getting help, or hindrance, from the senior detective assigned to help with the case? Does she have a chip on her shoulder, or are all the other (male) members of the murder squad out to get her?

Good detective story and good story of Antoinette's place in the detective squad. I would recommend for any body that likes a good detective story with a bit more."
"Same good story, and what I like best is when reality and consequence are bigger than you expect in a story, how it scrapes the dark places and how choices reverberate through the story. Love this writer."
"Read on a whim, wanting to delve a little further into the murder mystery genre. This has got everything I could possibly want. Intrigue, crime, unexpected enemies, and witnesses that won't talk. Further, the main characters are so intriguing that the book could be entirely about them. I wouldn't complain. French has the knack for writing a female character who isn't bogged down by her femininity, or at least tries not to be. Beautifully executed."
"I listened to the audiobook, so should say that listening the lovely Hilda Fay's narration MAY have made the book a little better than it would have been had I simply read it. She is Irish, and her voice made the story and characters come alive. Some parts were a little draggy, but all in all, it delivered."
"It is so rare to find a series, particularly one getting this long, that doesn't suffer a decline in quality after a while. French's mysteries are some of the best around because she manages to keep things fresh, from interesting plots to fully realized, memorable characters. Not to mention the quality of her writing is far, far above your typical mystery author."
Dublin Murder Squad....good book.
"My least favorite POV so far, but it caught me up and by the end I wasn't disliking her quite so much..."
"This was the grumpy detective murder mystery that my heart didn't know it needed. The MC is a jaded delight, the mystery is engaging, and it takes place in Ireland. I'm set. "
"I have read all of Ms. French's novels. I really enjoyed this one as I have enjoyed all of them It kept me wondering until the end of the story who did it and whether he was going to be caught. Antoinette Conway is a real go-getter detective. She has to prove her ability a lot more than the men in the squad. Her partner, Steve Moran, also is a go-getter but is less intense and strives to smooth things over when Conway goes overboard. I had a little difficulty with the Irish words and even had to look some of them up on the Internet. "
"Audio: this title might be better (for this American ear) in print -- I had difficulty hearing at times while driving, a hard time understanding the dialect, and a hard time differentiating some of the characters - but those might not be a problem at all for other listeners. I enjoyed the peeling back of the layers of the mystery but it was not the compelling read/listen that earlier titles were and I actually give it a 3.5. I didn't find Antoinette Conway a sympathetic character though the concept of an unwanted female in the sexist male bastion could be interesting. "
"Antoinette and her partner investigate the murder of young girl, Aisleen. Complicated plot but good."
"Riveting and well written, the murder whodunit has great dialog (even if I didn't understand many of the Irish slang words!). Makes me want to read the rest of Tara French's ""Dublin Murder Squad"" books. I am not usually a murder mystery reader but this was very well written with great characters."
I'm a Tana French fan and this book did not disappoint.
"French sure spins a good story. This time it's murder Detective Conway's investigation into a murder. Conway's mad at the world, fighting off the chauvinism of her own squad, and not sure whom she can trust. She and her new partner, Moran, try to investigate while not tipping their hands to either suspects or to the other detectives.

Wish the dialogue weren't so profane."
Super murder mystery.
"Another 3.5 stars - her first two books ruined me!!! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this book (as I really enjoy all her books) but nothing has compared to the first two books. Perhaps I should go back and re-rate those to 5 stars, and everything since to 4 stars :)"
"A good read, as are all her books."
"Good lord but this lady can write!

Every time I read one of her books I go to Youtube and search for/watch all the Dublin accents I can. I finally remembered to listen to this one as an audiobook and it didn’t disappoint."
"Conway and Moran solve what at appears to be a domestic violence murder. Felt a little long, but better than her last book. "

"This is my third Tanya French book. Unlike some, I don't claim blind loyalty to a writer, nor do I expect perfection. But when I settle in with a Tanya French novel, I'm confident I'll be entertained. And I have a weakness for tough heroines with self-doubt. This one isn't my favorite, but a good read that I'm happy I didn't pass up."
"As a member of a hard-bitten homicide squad in Dublin, Antoinette Conway dreams of tracking down a master criminal or cunning psychopath. Instead, she and her partner catch what appears to be a straightforward case of domestic violence with the killing of a young woman, Aislinn. They even have an obvious perpetrator: her boyfriend Rory, who showed up for dinner at precisely the time she was murdered.

Needless to say, the case proves far more darker and convoluted than anyone anticipated, with suspects rising to the surface, and sinking back into darkness until the very end of the novel.

But the real drama of The Trespasser doesn’t take place on the damp streets of Stoneybatter and other Dublin neighborhoods, but among the detectives, the “Murder D’s,” themselves. Conway must face down a wall of misogyny and petty harassment from other male detectives as she leads the investigation into Aislinn’s death, notably from the smooth-talking Breslin, who never misses an opportunity to undercut her.

On one level, Trespasser is a meticulous police procedural, with copious amounts of inside information about the culture of the Irish police, along with a detailed playbook for how to conduct police interrogations. (Good cop-bad cop is only the beginning.) A third or more of the novel consists of question sessions with suspects and witnesses.

But French is even more interested in the psychological price that Conway must pay to maintain her place in such a hostile macho world. On one hand, she has become deeply disillusioned with her fellow detectives. But paradoxically, she can’t resist the deep attraction, even love, she feels for the work, for being part of an elite Dublin’s homicide unit. One of the few descriptive passages – the book is largely Conway’s interior monologue – is not about any charming city scene, but the glowing night windows of the Murder squad itself.

French pushes Conway’s character to an extreme: she is loyal to her friends and good at her job, but she has few other redeeming qualities. Conway treats the hapless Rory with contempt for being teary at news of Aislinn’s death, and more generally for being a wuss who runs a pathetic bookstore. So much for literary Dublin. She also deals ruthlessly with her father, who deserted the family when she was a child.

The novel builds its narrative tension effectively, even if some of the interior monologue stretches on too long, belaboring character points that are quite clear to the reader – Conway’s tough-mindedness, Breslin’s treachery, Aislinn’s delusions, among others.

Conway is not a pleasant woman – certainly not someone you would want to chat up in a pub, nor find on the other side of the table in a police interrogation room. But she’s not a bad companion in a book.
"
"Tana French's best so far.

As always, French grabs you on page one and doesn't let go. Tight characters and enough twists to keep you turning pages. I love the depth of Antoinette and that she faces her flaws."
"French's stories are always riveting and full of detail and this novel stayed true to form. And, although all her cases usually strike the detectives in a personal manner, this story unfolded much different than the others for me. Detective's Conway's struggles with the rest of the murder squad and not necessarily a personal connection to the victim/case drove the perspective in this one. Somewhat unique, also, is that we revisit a detective that played a much larger role than usual in a previous story. Maybe only riveted by Detective Mackey in The Likeness/Faithful Place."
Better than the last few. Female protagonist again finally!
"This is another winner from Tana French. She is justly renowned for her suspenseful, character-driven literary mysteries that revolve around the Dublin Murder Squad (her invention.) I thoroughly enjoy reading French for the beauty of her writing, mordant humor, social commentary, witty dialogue and deep psychological insights into what's driving (and haunting) her characters. I also appreciate that each book features a different detective who we get to know inside and out.

The heroine of The Trespasser, Detective Antoinette Conway, is deftly portrayed. I found it hard to read about her struggles with the squad, who have it in for her as the lone female murder detective. She's sharp-tongued, pugnacious and never backs down, which are other reasons she's not popular. Fortunately, her partner is Stephen Moran, the hero of French's outstanding previous novel, The Secret Place. Moran has a knack for understanding and working with the prickly Conway. I enjoyed their complex relationship and (mostly) friendly banter.

Other readers have described the plot, so I won't go into it here. The murder investigation is intricate and intriguing, but it's the characters, rich sense of place and French's writing style which cause me to drop everything, hunker down and read any time she publishes a new book.

Here are a few of the lines I particularly enjoyed:

""Why don't you two cover the office romance,"" Breslin says. ""Feminine intuition, and all that jazz.""
""Mine's in the shop,"" I say. ""Transmission went. We'll just have to go with actual detective work.""

""Outside the window my street is dark, the street lamps fighting the night and losing. The wind is pushing around a paper bag from the chipper, slamming it up against a wall, holding it there for a second before tossing it down the road again.""

""The room feels charged up with too many stories, jostling in the corners, pushing for space.""

""I see me tilting like a hawk high in warm air, while below me he unrolls all my might-have-beens, for me to circle above at my leisure till every fork and tributary is stamped into my mind, reclaimed and mine. I see him opening his cloak to show me all the lost pages of my story written in silver on the night-sky lining.""

""A big solve does that to you, leaves the world scoured dawn-white, sand-white, empty except for the solve smooth and heavy as a deep-dived rock in your hand.""

This woman can write, and tell compelling stories. What more do you want from a book?
"
"First: Be aware that I read this book as a stand alone piece. That's important because I felt it worked. French does a good enough job rebuilding her ""Murder Squad"" that I didn't feel overwhelmed or lost. My only concern with how well she created her world was that if I were to read other books in the same universe I might find similar ""rebuildings"" frustrating.

Second: The narrator. There were moments that I enjoyed the realism of the main character. French does a great job of balancing moments of genius with moments of stupidity which average out, for the most part, to a well rounded protagonist. However, there were also parts of the narrator's tone and focus that frustrated me. There were times where I couldn't follow her logic and wished that she would take her own advice, but I feel that French did this purposefully and I applaud her for that.

Third: Leading on the Audience. French does a masterful job of casting doubt over any theory that the characters seem to be following. She allows characters to dapple both in the most straight forward of theories for who committed the crime and to envision some of the most outlandish. So by the time the surprise reveal came along, I was tentative to trust it and I was thrilled by my lack of trust for where the story was going.

Fourth: Weak Plot Points. Now, I don't really mind weak plot points for the most part, but I do mind them when the entire plot line rests on them. The big reveal occurs (and I won't spoil it) after a far too coincidental series of events. This weak spot became so prevalent that I couldn't really get passed it, which was unfortunate. I reached a point that I had to basically pretend those weak spots didn't happen and move forward.

Fifth: Packaging. This book is gritty, realistic and dynamic. The title itself warrants a discussion. Everything about this book was leading to an hastily packaged albeit incomplete ending, but suddenly French switched gears and packages up the story so perfectly it was hard to swallow. It almost felt like there was a publisher somewhere that demanded that her ending solved the mystery completely.

Read this book if you enjoy mystery and thriller novels. Read this book if you like crime procedurals that do not follow the typical pattern (until the end). Read this book if you like reading a large novel quickly. Read this book if you want to be teased about big ideas and current issues but then ultimately not really discuss them in any meaningful way."
"There is a clear pattern to Tana French's books, and either you embrace it with the expectant love of what she writes, or expect it too readily until the sparkle kind of wears out. Now in the sixth arrival of the Dublin Murder Squad series, I found myself equally embraced in the beauty & the character depth that makes her so skilled at her craft - but still feeling that twinge that asks 'haven't I seen this before'.

Like in previous stories, the main narrator is a character we got to see in a more limited view in a previous story - this case Detective Antoinette Conway, whom we met in The Secret Place. Like previous, she faces a 'case of a lifetime', maybe not so much in complexity or depth; but in how it changes your life for better or worse. Part of the brilliance that made me fall for Tana French's novels is her way to pull us so deep into the narrator's mind that we end up seeing the world through their eyes - with all the self-created misconceptions that come with it. Probably as much if not more as any before (except maybe Ryan from 'In the Woods') Detective Conway is very much in her own head. This 'case of a lifetime' will test her in all that head space, and test it well.

It's because this is becoming routine, that I find myself looking ahead in my own head space. Figuring some things out before it happens, wondering where there would be tie back to earlier clues slipped in along the way. I am already guessing who is going to be the narrator for for #7 (I want the Gaffer; but it's probably going to be Fleas; would puke if it is Breslin). This really comes across as the only downside of the book for me. In a way, it is why Faithful Place and Secret Place stood out - because they bucked much of the same trends in detective work.

But if you are a fan of Tana French, it's because you love the view along the drive more than the destination. Her character development is incredible. Her descriptions are rich and deep, leaving you fully feeling yourself pulled into that world. Then she has the beautiful mind to intermix with sharp cutting dialog. She can slide you details of the detail in an interview room, give you the emotional ebbs and flows of the suspect, then throw in words like ""so you stuck your micky in her gash"" - and it feels like a continuous waterfall of the English language.

So, even thought I probably can guess much of what the next book will be like, just like much of this one didn't take me as surprise, I am still left itching to know when the #7 will grace my bookshelf."
Was a good mystery but drag at the end. Detective Conway and Steve assign to a murder of a girl in her home goes around gangs intruder boyfriend Breslin a sign to help them but really storing them away from detective McCann who was having affair with victim. Aslin actually trying to get back at McCann for not telling her years ago her daddy went missing because he shack up with someone else. Good book but long
"I always like Tana French, but this character not so much. She (the character) uses way too much language for my taste. It is fascinating to me how all of T. French's main protagonists are so very different. This means if I don't like the language of the character in this book, I should still try one of her others because it isn't a trademark of the author, but of this particular character. That being said, the story was completely absorbing and I highly recommend it."
"I'm struggling to communicate my thoughts about this book. I wanted it to be amazing. I wanted it to pull me in (like all her other books) and nag at the back of my mind if I walked away from it, but for three weeks I tried; reading a few pages here, a chapter there. I didn't feel that familiar tug. Though, I'm willing to make plenty of excuses for it: I was busy and didn't have enough time to devote to the book, it's been so long since I've read the first five books in the series. Whatever the reason, after three weeks, I had to return the book to the library half way through. But damnit if I won't try again in the future."
"Started off a bit slow-- the detective narrating the novel was annoying in the beginning, but eventually I learned to like her. The whining and paranoia she displays starts to make sense and play an important part in the plot later on. It was totally worth sticking it out. "
"My first Tana French book. I do like a good murder mystery, especially if I can't guess the ending. After 250 pages I was wondering how this book could continue for another 200 pages. Well, was I surprised. I will read this author again. Story is set in Ireland."
Long but super solid and enjoyable
"This is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. If you’re not familiar with the series it follows one Murder Squad, but not the same characters. In each book you are introduced to the character to be featured in the next book and you get to revisit some characters along the way. This way you get the sense of the world they live in, without following one main character through the books.

While the books also have good and interesting plots, like the usual crime book. It is also a lot about the detectives and their character development and the squad as a whole. This is becoming more and more clear as the books go on.
Tana French also writes with a kind of passion that makes you carefully read all the words not to miss a single beat. Her books are never shallow and never boring.

“Every Murder D I’ve known does it: takes one long look at the victim’s face. It doesn’t make sense, not to civilians. If we just wanted a mental image of the vic, to keep us reminded who we’re working for, any phone selfie would do a better job. If we needed a shout of outrage to get our hearts pumping, the wounds do that better than the face.”

What baffles me is how Ms French moves from male to female narrators and has me convinced in every sentence of which part she plays. She also has me convinced that she’s a retired detective with inside knowledge of everything police and crime related.

“The vic’s home is your shot at getting a handle on this person you’re never going to meet.”

I am always right there with her, through every scene. Where in other books I might lose interest when I see the plot laid out before me, but not with the Dublin Murder Squad! Even after I know who the killer is, I’m still right there savoring every single word of their confession. Which can drag out sometimes, but it’s still good. It’s always just consistently good!

Some thrillers you can’t wait to finish, fast flipping pages looking for the answer. And while The Dublin Murder Squad holds excitement, it��s not my main purpose for being there. I’ve grown fond of all the perfectly flawed and absolutely beautifully human characters. I’m convinced she bases her characters on real people, there’s just no way you can create characters so real and flawed from nothing.

“The stuff people think I should try to hide - being tall, being a woman, being half whatever - is the stuff I keep up front and in their faces. If they can’t handle it, I can use that.”
"
"Okay, this one was so much better than the last one. "
"Tana French works her magic again. The sixth instalment in her Dublin Murder squad series belongs to detective Antoinette Conway. As the only woman in the squad she is the target for daily jibes and jokes. On the surface it appears to be a chuckling, light-hearted disrespect but the behaviour has settled into an oppressive environment of chronic harassment.


The disrespect is fuel for Conway. She's a fighter and a winner and she tells herself she doesn’t mind that she has to work twice as hard as anyone else to gain a modicum of respect – that’s how she’d work anyway. That’s been her perspective ever since her father walked out on the family. It’s no world for whiners. If you’re knocked down, don’t cry--get up, work hard and win. But everyday she’s smiling through a new jibe, joke or prank without end and in truth its threatening to overwhlem her. She’s got a job offer for private security and though it feels like failure to consider it, it’s starting to look more than tempting.


Her only ally is her partner, nice guy murder rookie Steven Moran (first introduced as a well meaning snitch in Faithful Place, then as the narrator of The Secret Place, which featured Conway as his own reluctant helper).


Conway and Moran investigate what appears to be a simple domestic murder, except Conway knows she’s met this victim before. Almost all the evidence points to the victim’s hapless new boyfriend. Following the wee little bit that doesn’t leads them to speculate about the integrity of the murder squad itself—and as Conway finds herself struggling to separate dark new levels of paranoia from legitimate inquiry her own history comes back to haunt her.


The Dublin Murder squad is a series of books that features a different narrator each time out. French writes each volume from a notably different point of view: voice, worldview, motivation, backstory. She's brilliant at creating a clever, provocative murder scenario and matching it to an interesting detective in a way that pushes all of that detective's buttons. Her detectives don't remain static observers capable of taking us through book after book of murder cases. We join them for the pivotal investigation of their lives and their account of the twists and turns of the investigation, is also a confrontation with their past and present selves, and a harrowing journey of self-examination."
I wasn't aware that this was part of a series. Review later.
"Just finished this one up last night! Tana French continues to write a compelling mystery. For some reason, this one was lacking in the atmosphere department. Usually her settings become characters in their own right, but this one fell short of that for me. Regardless, I still love her Irish ass."
"A very engaging murder mystery/thriller. Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran of the Murder Squad, not the most popular team around, are given what appears to be a routine domestic murder. Their investigation uncovers hints of something much more sinister, and their investigation suffers from obstruction by their peers. The solution is tricky, indeed."
"It seemed like Antoinette was too much in her own head; in her own way. I was struggling from approx. 1/3rd to 1/2 of the way through and then as it reached a conclusion, I found it to be a page turner that was leaving me guessing where it would end. The first of The Dublin Murder Squad books I have read."
Tana French has created a very memorable main character. Talk about a chip on a shoulder...super size this one! The mystery itself twists and turns and then fools you in the end. This was a fun book to read.
"I listened through Audible. The narrator was terrific, the plot exciting, the characters believable. Altogether an enjoyable experience. "
"The Trespasser

I have enjoyed all of Tana French's books, but this one was my least favorite. I found the female primary character very harsh and obviously the cause of her own problems. I could not relate to her rationalizations, and even though French gave the reader enough justification she still seemed too unfeeling to develop any sort of empathy for. I liked her partner, Steve, and most of the other characters rang true so the story was played out well. Having spent thirty years in a similar environment I really never ran into a woman her with such rough edges and sharp demeanor. Not an attractive representation for the main character and it sort of turned me off.

The plot was good. I have worked investigations that went back and forth l I keep this one. That could drive you crazy from not being able to get a tight grip on the truth. So, I enjoyed the read and would recommend it to others who like cops and murder."
"Love the expert writing, dialogue, and character development. Most of all enjoyed the exploration of personality limitations and growth. "
Great!
"[4/5 stars]

I am officially a loyal tana french girlie.

I LOVE the female characters she writes and generally, all of her characters are so well-written and fleshed out. The story building is not my favorite but the characters definitely make up for the story.

This book wraps up the dublin murder squad series really well. I will admit that I was still holding on to the hope that Rob would be mentioned in this book. I wanted to see my baby one last time ;-;

great series!





"
"The Murder Squad is nothing like where Detective Antoinette Conway came from. Apart from her partner, all the other detectives on the squad seem to have it out for her and while’s she’s holding on, she’s close to the breaking point. When a new case lands in her lap, Antoinette and her partner dive right in to what appears to be a typical lovers’ fight turned murder, with young Aislinn Murphy discovered dead in her flat. However, as she uncovers more details, it becomes clear that this murder isn’t typical. Why is the rest of the squad pushing for Antoinette to arrest Aislinn’s boyfriend when it seems clear he isn’t the murderer? And what is one of the squad detectives really hiding? There’s clearly more to Aislinn than previously thought. This taut, quick-paced thriller will have you looking in dark corners and following Antoinette as she determinedly digs out the truth.

This is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, and although I hadn’t read any other books in the series, I dove right into this story with no problems. There’s just enough background on Antoinette to make you understand her current situation, and feel like you get a good grasp on her as a character. The author uses descriptive writing, as well as deft use of language and slang, to put you firmly in the Dublin setting and make everything feel quite real. This is the kind of story where although it’s tempting to whip right through, it’s important to slow down a bit and pay attention to the details. Because the information about some of the characters unravels, it’s key to be able to remember things to understand what’s happening to them in the story, and how they play a part in the bigger picture. What I found interesting was I was equally vested in the main character as I was in finding out who committed the murder and why. Antoinette is a complicated character, and this adds depth to the entire story. After reading this one, I’m thinking it would be a good idea to go back and start at the beginning of the series, just because I enjoyed this one so much.

I’d give this book (and probably the whole series) to readers who enjoy books by Mo Hayder.

"Great book with a strong female lead. I enjoyed following our protagonist's progress in this well-written, very enjoyable story."
"I'm a newcomer to Tana French and her female detective, Antionette Conway, but I enjoyed this. I will try to track down a copy of In the Woods and others in the series."
"Well done, as always. French has procedural and psychological down pat. The book keeps you engaged. "
"Not her best work (In the Woods is still my favorite) but a good murder-mystery page turner. The main character is a bit over dramatic, but it's a fun cop drama read. "
"This review is written with thanks to Hodder and Stoughton and Netgalley for my copy of The Trespasser.Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are detectives in Dublin's Murder Squad. One morning, just as they are due to finish a night shift, they receive a report of the murder of Aislinn Murray. It looks like a straightforward act of domestic violence, but as they start to investigate, will they discover that there is more to this case than meets the eye?When I first started reading The Trespasser, I was concerned that as the sixth instalment in a series, it would be difficult to follow. However, my worries were unfounded. I found French's writing style immediately easy to read, and the character of Conway easy to relate to. Conway is the novel's narrator, and the informal style of narration and humour inherent in the narration makes the character likeable. French also makes reference to the political environment in which the novel is set, which can be seen through the difficulties faced by Conway as a mixed race, female police officer, and this adds depth to her character.The Trespasser is clearly a very well researched novel, and it gives the reader insight into the workings of the Police Force in Dublin. French combines the details of the investigation with complex workplace politics to create tension in the novel, which makes it a highly engaging read. There is also a twist as the investigation reaches its conclusion, which means the novel picks up pace towards the end, and is difficult to put down!However, the fast pace which is so appealing as the novel progresses is not established immediately. The beginning of The Trespasser is fairly slow. and although it is clear that the initial focus point of the investigation is a red herring, the suspect in question remains so until relatively late in the plot. As a result, it took me some time to become fully immersed in the book.Overall, I enjoyed The Trespasser, and I am looking forward to reading more of French's work."
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad series. Tana French does a great job with both characters and dialog, and this one is no exception. It did have me wondering about the reliability of the narrator, which adds another twist to the whole thing..."
"I started this book back in November. It was a library book that became due when I was less than half way through, and I couldn't renew it because there were other people on the wait list. I honestly thought about not requesting the book again as I found the first third of the book a bit tiresome with the main character whining about everyone being out to get her. It took until February for the book to become available again. I started up where I left off and flew through the rest of the book. I especially appreciated the ending, as I have been disappointed with the endings of several otherwise well written books lately. "
I have loved all the Tana French books. This book was entertaining but it didn't have me wondering and wasn't as suspenseful as the rest of her books. I also didn't really like the main character Antoinette which made reading the book less enjoyable. I really miss Cassie and Rob. 
"It takes a while but this book is quite good. The first 100 pages are tedious but if you stay with it, the story develops into a real page turner. "
"I was very excited and very nervous for the newest Dublin Murder Squad case. I feel like this series peaked at book 3 (Faithful Place - incredible ) and started downward, hitting a disappointing low at book 5 (The Secret Place). While The Trespasser didn't hit the level of the first few titles, it is certainly returning in the right direction. (Side note: I really don't like the title for this book - it just doesn't work for me.) Normally I think French's writing and characterization carries her work most, but here I didn't feel like we were getting into the meat of Antoinette and Steve's characters and relationships until way late in the book - the last chapter, basically. And the descriptions were good, just not as captivating as earlier books. Because of these things, I think the plot has more of a chance to shine. Their investigation seems fruitless and often stupid, like puppies chasing their tails, but eventually they scent the rabbit and off they go. I can't talk much about their investigating because it will give away the murderer, but I really liked the direction she took with the guilty party here.

And here I am again, disappointed to have read this because it means I have to wait ages for book 7.

The fine print: received ARC from NetGalley.

*edit: We did this for book club, so since I didn't really have time to read, I decided to listen. I enjoyed it more the second time, and the narrator, Hilda Fay, was incredible. So now I'm even more ready for the next installment!*"
"I very much enjoyed the relationship and banter between Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran in ""The Secret Place"" and was very happy to see them as actual partners in this book. ""The Trespasser"" finds them investigating the murder of 26-year-old Aislinn Murray. With the scene set for a romantic dinner for two and no sign of forced entry, the murder seems to be a straightforward open-and-shut domestic case. Despite pressure from more senior colleagues to hurry up and charge Aislinn's date for the crime, Conway and Moran realize there is more to the case than meets the eye. As they delve deeper and their tenuous grasp on the case begins to unravel, so do they, uncertain whether they can even trust each other or their own thoughts.

Having read books 3-6 of Tana French's Dublin Murder squad series, I find that I enjoyed ""The Trespasser"" the most. With the previous novels, I often found myself skimming over the longer passages, eager to skip the extraneous details and get to the story. This was not the case for me with book six. Despite the lack of action with the case, I hung on to every word and detail. Although the book dragged in a few spots, overall I was engrossed and couldn't put the book down. I enjoyed the insight into Antoinette's past and motivations, as well as the partnership between her and Steve. For me, the partnership was also a major improvement over the ""lone wolf"" attitudes of Frank Mackey and Scorcher Kennedy in the previous novels. It's also nice to have a strong female character featured after the side characters in books 3 and 4 who were a bit of a mess.

I would love to see Detectives Conway and Moran in future books, although with the current format of a new main character each book, it seems unlikely that we will see them as feature characters again. At the very least, it would be great to see another female detective and more positive working relationships in subsequent books."
"When I initially read In the Woods several years ago, I enjoyed the book, but for whatever reason, not enough to continue on with French's future releases. When The Trespasser was released, it wasn't possible to be anywhere on social media without being smacked in the face by people's rave reviews and utter excitement for all things Tana French. Since I never do things half-assed, I chose to start from the very beginning and give all her books a second chance and I'm extremely glad I did.

While I felt slightly let down after reading The Secret Place, my absolute love for Broken Harbour didn't allow for any hesitation before picking up The Trespasser. I'm happy to say that French's still holding on strong and The Secret Place was just a little blip in a series of amazing crime novels.

All the details that I loved about her other books are present in her newest release. Detective Conway is such a badass female lead and her narration did not disappoint in the slightest. The chemistry that I loved so much between Ryan and Maddox in her first novel is a key point to The Trespasser with Conway and Moran and it made my reading experience that much more enjoyable.

In true Tana French fashion, The Trespasser is a dense read, but there's nothing boring about how slowly things unfurl as the plot becomes more complex with each chapter. French also manages to create such a multilayered story that leaves the reader questioning everything happening right alongside Conway and that's an aspect of French's writing style that I absolutely LOVE.

While I'm sad there isn't another French novel for me to immediately pick up upon finishing this one, her writing has given me a newfound appreciation for crime thrillers and I'm only hoping that other authors will be able to live up to my expectations until I am able to read the next Tana French book."
"GREAT murder mystery....horrible language. There were a few twists and turns that I wasn't expecting, the whole story was well thought-out, and it was a good read. I don't think I'm going to read anymore Tana French, even though I think she's a fantastic author, on account of the bad language. Why is it so necessary?! "
"Tana French is probably my favourite author. So a four star book from her is still amazing. EVERYONE SHOULD READ HER!! But still... I think this book might wind up being my least favourite so far.

The thing I adore about Tana's books is the characterisation. After reading Rob Ryan, or Frank Mackey, or Stephen Moran, I felt like I KNEW them. Totally. Reading Tana French is like being inside someone else's head for a few days. Her characterisation is masterful. The characters all have fatal flaws and it all usually ties together beautifully. It does here, too, to an extent.

I loved Conway in Secret Place and couldn't wait for this book. She is cutting, and hilarious, and damaged in a way I couldn't wait to explore. I still love their partnership so so much. But compared to the other view point characters in the series, I feel sort of left outside her head. It could be the swap to first person present tense, or it could actually be Conway's standoffish character, but I don't feel like I know her much more than book five, despite being in her head for 700 or so pages.

I thought the central plot was interesting, and the what-ifs tied me in knots - I understood Conway's frustration. Some of her personal plot lines could have gone further, I think. With one in particular :no spoilers: that was built up to, then over and done with and never seemed to have any emotional impact on her again.

There's a lot to this book; lots of parallels between the victim and suspect, between Conway and the victim. There's lots I want to mull over and pull apart some more.

And my final question... OH GOD there's only really one person I can see being the next view point character and I'm really on the fence about this!! But of course I'll read it and probably adore it. Because it is Tana French. And everyone should read Tana French. Because she is an absolute legend."
"This was not my favorite Tana French book, but this book was probably at a disadvantage in that regard from the beginning, as I think any visit to the Tana French universe that does not include significant time with Frank Mackey to be a travesty. That said, it was a very good read. This is the sixth book in French's Dublin Murder Squad series, in which a different narrator tells their story in the first person. The narrator of this book is Antonette Conway, a relative newcomer to the squad, and the only woman. She has been hazed and interfered with by male members of the squad so much that she has become almost paranoid, wondering if every event that befalls her is some attempt to undermine her. When she and her partner, Steve Moran, the narrator of the last book, are given what appears to be an open and shut domestic murder case to work, she begins to wonder why the evidence isn't adding up. Antonette is not always a likeable carrier, and at times is not someone you can root for - which is a problem for me as a reader. She is crass, foul-mouthed, picks fights with her co-workers when she doesn't need to, and is unable to recognize genuine acts of kindness by those - usually Moran - who actually care about her. As in all French books, we do get a better understanding of her, and as we get to know her, and the victim of the crime, we reach a better understanding of her and her motives, even as she discovers the identity of the murderer, and the almost impossible spot the discovery puts her in. This was a good story. But I'll hope for a return from Frank in the next book. I did this by audiobook, and recommend the production, as the Irish accents really add to the read, and this reader really helps to convey the emotional roller coaster the characters go through."
"Tana French excels in deeply complex characters. Her Dublin Murder Squad is a sea of moral cloudiness. “Breslin would find a way to see himself as the hero, no matter what he did. That’s where he starts, with the idea that he’s the good guy, so whatever he’s doing must be right. Then he works backwards from there to figure out how… It’s not just Breslin who thinks that way; we all do.” (p114) So says Antoinette Conway, the lead detective in The Trespasser, the sixth in The Dublin Murder Squad series. Antoinette first appeared in The Secret Place, the previous book in the series, but I barely recognized her in this one which is a testament to how paranoid she has become.

On the surface, The Trespasser sees Antoinette and her partner, Stephen Moran, looking into the case of a young woman found murdered in her home with no sign of forced entry. The easy answer is that it is a domestic dispute gone horribly wrong. Is the harassment she faces on the job personal or designed to derail her investigation? On another level, the book is about the stories we tell ourselves and the bit parts we play in each other’s fantasies. So deeply do we believe in our stories that the borders with reality must be moved to accommodate them. Everything is played out here: the victim’s revenge fantasy; her boyfriend’s romance fantasy; the killer’s white knight fantasy; the lead detective’s “eveyone’s out to get me” fantasy. But wait, Antoinette is so determined that this does not apply to her that her own daydreams turn dark and are heading towards the cliffs of mental breakdown. Tana French has allowed some of her leads in the past to go teetering over the side and the question remains whether Antoinette will go following. Another fantastic psychological mystery from this author; she has not had a miss yet."
"I really enjoyed this one, it lacked a bit of the chilling urgency of In The Woods and also lacked the high-stakes denouement found in some of the previous books, however there was a different layer of complication and drama (which I won't go into, since it would ruin the book) that I really liked. The character development of Detective Conway was also really enjoyable — her propensity to butt heads with everyone probably already drove you mad in The Secret Place so it's great to get inside her head in The Trespasser."
"Tana French never disappoints, great characters, fast moving story, nothing predicable. If you like mysteries, you will like this one."
Perfect beach book thriller. 
"I have to admit I didn't exactly 'take' to Detective Antoinette Conway in Tana French's previous book, 'The Secret Place'; I found her unlikeable, prickly and paranoid, and it seems I wasn't the only one, her laddish colleagues in Dublin's Murder Squad detectives all seem to resent her and hate her guts. Or do they?

The Trespasser is a dark and intense read. Centred around a seemingly open-and-shut domestic violence murder, the action is sometimes quite slow but always compelling. The witty Irish dialogue smooths the way to a satisfying and breathtaking climax and the whole book is beautifully written, although personally I found some of the descriptive passages slightly florid and overblown for my taste; lets face it, there's only so many ways to describe bad weather before the reader will skip off onto the next paragraph.

For a change I managed to guess a couple of the story's surprise plot twists, but then perhaps there were intentional hints that anyone else would have spotted long before myself. I am very slow on the uptake with murder mysteries usually so that enhanced my reading experience. I especially enjoyed the sequences when Antoinette and her partner, Detective Steve Moran, interrogated the suspects in classic good cop/bad cop manner and I must say that Detective Conway is finally growing on me as a character and I will be watching her future career with great interest.

All in all, a very good book and one that makes me want to revisit Ms French's previous Dublin Murder Squad novels sometime in the near future.

Many thanks to Tana French, publishers Hodder & Stoughton and to NetGalley for letting me read and review this terrific novel.
"
"I honestly don't know how to rate this one.

I fell into a book slump before I picked this up and so it did take me forever to read. But I did enjoy it.

Antoinette Conway is part of Dublin's murder squad, a detective group in Dublin specifically meant to investigate murders. She's had to start from the bottom and it's been doubly hard since a) she's a woman, b) she's a woman of color, and c) she's mixed. All of her coworkers are male, and since she's relatively new to the murder squad and a woman, her ""team"" intentionally picks on her. All except her partner, Steve Moran, or at least that's what she thinks.

One thing that made this book difficult to read were the amount of stories and ideas. The detectives go through tons of different suspects right from the beginning trying to narrow it down and it seems like they won't be able to catch the bad guy.

The story itself is really interesting but some of the language did bother me. There's a lot of cussing and a lot of English or Irish slang that makes normal sentences confusing in the beginning if you're not used to it.

Also I did notice that it seemed that some parts repeated themselves. Like one minute someone's suspicious about another character, and then they convince themselves that it was nothing. And then one or two chapters later their suspicious of the same character again. And they use the SAME logic to convince themselves that it was nothing.

Overall, the pacing could have been better. The font was extremely small and the chapters pretty long as well. Add in that all of the chapters seemed to end cleanly with no cliffhangers make the pace seem slower. But the plot was good and I enjoyed most of the characters.

Actual rating: 3.5
Minus .5 for the editing
Minus 1 for the pacing
"
"This is a good read starring a female Irish cop who has recently started working in the elite Dublin Murder Squad. It opens with her, Antoinette Conway, and her partner, Stephen Moran, catching what looks like a simple domestic violence case that turns into much more. The young woman found dead in her flat, with only a few tangible clues for the Detectives to work, seems to suggest another simple case foisted upon the newbies. It's not the major case they're both looking to wrap their detective skills around which disappoints them. The main clues revolve around text messages showing she was excited about seeing Rory, the guest she was expecting for dinner. In the cops eyes it makes him look like a slam dunk for the murder. But, the chief of the unit burdens them with the arrogant superstar of the unit, Don Breslin, as a third hand. When it becomes clear that he's in too much of a rush to nail this on the suspected perp the case starts to take on a different look.

What follows is a well knit cop story. Promising leads are discussed, followed and found fallow. Interrogations of various characters are done and each are a highlight of the tale. Ms. French has a good ear for the way cops talk to and with each other. She understands just how in sync a pair of detectives must be while trying to gather information from someone. The ""good cop - bad cop"" scenes are well played. And the treatment of Conway by the more unenlightened members of the squad gets under your skin very quickly. My only complaint is how Conway can be so clear thinking in instances about the case but seems equally unaware when mulling over who's doing what to her in the squad room.

This is my first Tana French read, it probably won't be my last."
"I like the two main characters in this book. In addition to seeing them deal with workplace issues and trying to fight crime, we are treated into a deep dive of the psyche of Ms. Conway. An excellent read.
"
"I won't subject you to too long a dissection of yet another Tana French novel, partly because I read them pretty regularly and partly because I not only reread a second one of her Dublin Murder Squad books this month, but also read her new standalone, The Witch Elm, which I'll be talking about later. This is only the second time I've read The Trespasser; the first was the weekend after my ex broke up with me last year, so my memories of it were pretty patchy, to say the least. It's not on quite the same level as her best books (Broken Harbour, The Likeness, The Secret Place, for my money), partly because the motive is less interesting: it circles around a girl called Aislinn Murray, found dead in her home, whose entire life seems to be a blank. Only when the detective on the case, Antoinette Conway, remembers that she's seen Aislinn before - years ago, asking questions about the father who went missing when she was a child and who was never found - do clues start making sense, but they all point to the one place Conway really doesn't want to go... As always, French is uniquely excellent at differentiating her detectives, making them individuals whose problems are complex and convincing, far from the dysfunction-by-numbers drunk with marital problems that often seems to pass for a detective in this genre. Conway's got issues - trust and a missing father among them - but she deals with them in her way, and part of her need to put Aislinn Murray's case to bed stems from a deep personal irritation with Aislinn's way of handling problems similar to her own. The writing, also as always, is spectacular, a blend of grit and lyricism that works incredibly well for me. Long may Tana French reign, I say."
"I think it's safe to say that Tana French has become one of my favourite authors. The Trespasser sees the return of Antoinette Conway and bright-eyed newbie, Stephen Moran, now partners in the Murder Squad. After two years in the squad and being given shitty domestic cases, Antoinette is burnt out and considering leaving. She's convinced the squad is out to get her; not irrational considering the barrage of bullying she receives from her fellow detectives on a daily basis. Meanwhile, ambitious Steve lays out theories on their new case that are so far-fetched that, while at first intrigue Conway, along the way test their partnership to breaking point. Throughout the novel, Antoinette becomes increasingly paranoid and as we are in her head the whole time, the reader can't help but get sucked into the vortex along with her. I was so angry and paranoid for her.

I know this is so cliche of me to say but this book was a real page-turner. It's been a while since I've read anything that I couldn't put down. It moves along at a good clip without getting bogged down by flashbacks or backstories. The writing is clever, sharp, and funny even for something this dark. As for the detectives, sometimes their inexperience shows, but there's no doubt that these two are smart and stubborn as hell. I especially loved Antoinette—strong, sarcastic, and takes no bullshit from anyone. Tana French might have stretched it out a bit too long towards the end but I'm gonna put that on me seeing as I ploughed through the last 200 pages with minimal breaks. Told you I couldn't put it down. This novel can certainly stand alone but I recommend reading all the books that came before as part of the fun for me was picking out all the Easter eggs French occasionally throws in."
"*I have enjoyed all of Tana French's books, save her last one. I'm so glad I was able, once again, to become engrossed in her work. Quotations I liked:
“...the dark roads rained empty…” (2).
“...a massive scoop of boring and a bigger one of stupid, topped off with an avalanche of paperwork” (3).
“...old Dublin, working class and never-worked class” (8).
“His accent needs subtitles” (13).
“...blond hair, straightened and sprayed so ferociously that even murder hasn’t managed to mess it up” (14).
“...drips of wax stalagmited on the candlestick…”(15).
“The light through the windows is filling out; it’s ruthless on her, scraping away what should be offbeat-pretty, turning her to nothing but eye bags and mascara smudges on white” (45).
“‘Or maybe he wouldn’t give me the steam off his piss if I was dying of thirst. I know’” (70).
“Once you realize Breslin is an idiot, you start counting the cliches on their way out of his mouth and noticing that the slick hair is organized over a balding spot…” (78).
“...piling on the guilt and waving absolution like a doggy treat…” (82).
“...settling our arses into the quirks of our chairs…” (84).
“This guy couldn’t order a sandwich without tying himself up in knots about the possible consequences of mayonnaise” (93).
“I’m itching to punch Breslin in both his faces…” (152).
“The second Breslin walked in, he faded and shrank and twisted like a boil-washed jumper” (270).
“Faint wind struggles in the chimney” (306).
“...and that small nagging wind flutters in the chimney” (311).
“They hum like fist-sized hornets in the corners of the ceiling…” (412).

What a great book! tana Frech does it again and makes each murder squad book more exciting.
"Listened to this book which was very well read. A good ""who done it story""."
"This is really 3.5 stars for me. I absolutely loved the previous five books of the Dublin Murder Squad series and could easily reread any of them (and I am usually not a rereader). Tana French has a real gift for atmosphere and lyricism that truly brings Ireland to life yet still delivers great detective fiction. Her stories are richly layered with so much history, mystery, setting, and character interwoven and building off one another that they really transcend mere crime drama. I actually decided once on a whim to bike almost ten miles to the closest large bookstore in the evening just to buy a new Tana French book.

Now The Trespasser is still a good read. It is full of twists and turns and is difficult to put down, especially as the stakes rise to unexpected heights. The overarching theme is how everyone is the hero(ine) in their own tale, and how this gives us a kind of psychological tunnel vision that distorts reality. As the old rebuke goes, ""Not everything is all about you."" Protagonist Conway also had, I think, the strongest voice of any of French's narrators. There was an edge to her that the other ones lacked.

That being said, however, the rest felt so very bland. The sense of setting normally so palpable in French's writing was noticeably absent, to the extent that this could have been just about any city in North America or Europe. The plot was driven largely by dialogue, and there was a lot of talking. If it wasn't for all the carefully planned red herrings, The Trespasser would've felt like a filler book just pushed out to keep the series going. So alas, while I did enjoy reading this one, I won't be rereading it."
"The Trespasser is the latest installment of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. For those not familiar with the books, it is a fantastic series of murder mysteries featuring detective in Dublin PD''s murder squad. Each book is from the point of a view of a different detective that is normally introduced as a secondary character in the previous book.
This book features Antoinette Conway, a woman who always dreamed of being a murder detective but has been stuck solving easy cases and is regularly harassed by her co-workers because she is the only woman on a squad that believes women have no place there. When she and her partner are assigned to the murder of Aislinn Murray, they are expected to wrap it up as quickly as possible despite something seemingly off about their #1 suspect. As the case continues, lines become blurred and Antoinette questions whether someone really does want her off the squad or if she is just paranoid.
This book is another stellar addition to the series but it is much darker. Antoinette is, by design, not the most likable of characters. She is angry to the point of near rage. She is jaded and mistrusting, which is only marginally offset by her partner's boyish enthusiasm. Still, Tana French knows how to write detailed characters and engrossing plots. I highly recommend the series but would caution readers to start with one of the earlier books (no need to read in any particular order) before delving into this one.

*Thanks to Netgalley for an early copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*"
"I love Tana French and impatiently awaited this book (and insight into the mind of Detective Antoinette Conway, who was introduced in The Secret Place). Like all the Dublin Murder Squad books before this one, the tension builds beautifully, keeping both the narrator and reader on edge (and up way, way past their bedtime). The real gem in these books is not the whodunit but the psychological exploration of fully fleshed characters.

However, I think this story may have been the weakest yet in an outstanding series, and would have clocked in around 3 stars if not for the excellent writing. Despite the fact that I can empathize with Conway's experience of being a woman in a male-dominated field, I found myself having the least patience for her out of any other Murder Squad narrators. I can't put my finger on what about her drove me crazy, but I had a tough time getting on her side.


I also felt that Conway and Moran uncharacteristically overlooked an obvious possibility - that a cop would know how to wipe down a crime scene as well as if not better than a gangster - that occurred to me immediately, and that left me feeling disappointed in them from go. Their justification later on - that even when you dislike your squad-mates you innately trust that none of them are murderers - felt very weak.

It's still a solid book from a very gifted author, and I look forward to meeting her next narrator!"
"This is the first Tana French novel that I have read. Evidently this is the sixth novel in her “Dublin Murder Squad” series. In The Trespasser, we see a murder investigation through the eyes of Antoinette Conway, an abrasive mixed-race, working-class detective worn out from the harassment she’s received from the rest of the Dublin Murder Squad.

Being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like a lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast.

Did the boyfriend do it? Was this a gang related murder? Are dirty cops involved? No spoilers here.

I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed this book. Usually I read murder mysteries as a light interlude to more serious reading. The focus of this book is on personalities. There are no car chases or shoot outs. This is a psychologically rich murder mystery in which the detectives are as compelling as the whodunit. The interrogation scenes in the Dublin Murder Squad could rival those of John le Carré.
"
"Buf. I finished this yesterday at 2am, and the fact that reading this was the only thing i did for the previous 30-something hours (also included: sleeping, getting sick several times in a 3-hour bus ride, eating) tells you something--just as it did with any of the other books of the series.
She's brilliant in building the mystery and immersing the characters so deep into it they can't no longer see straight, or I can't see straight. I like that the mystery's got some surprises but that it all fits, no deux ex machina crap needed. I loved the characters and how their reactions and decisions are so important to what happens, but also so well-constructed. Conway got on my nerves sometimes, so distrustful she did sound a bit emo (not my words), but I still enjoyed her as a narrator a lot (all of hers ""and this is where if i were a normal person i would hug him"", not her words) and enjoyed seing her evolve. Her friendship with Moran is the best, and I'm so happy they ended bff (as opposed to stranged forever--never will I be over Into the Woods).
Still, I read the 5th of the series first, and before this one came out, I read the 3 first ones. I have only Broken Harbour left (and will read it in a few months, so I don't have to wait that long for the 7th Dublin Murder Squad) and none has wrecked me so much as the first 2 ones did, I don't know if I should be glad about this (the nightmares I had), or if maybe I've just gotten used to her style and dark atmosphere and now it takes more to get to me. But."

Everyone can jump down my throat, but I did not think French's sixth novel was as good as the first five.

Two things to keep in mind: anything she writes is about one million times better than any cookie cutter mystery, and I would never drop her from my reading list (far, far from it). But those first five? They have stayed with me, and when I say that, I mean that the feel of them is never far from me. Those spooky, spooky woods; inhabiting someone else's oh-so-odd skin; that close-knit and horribly-knit family; ghostly undertakings on a school's campus; and last but not least (actually the 4th novel), those holes in the walls (and I'd far rather shout that: THOSE HOLES). Every single one of those novels twisted reality, but not so much that the novels don't live in this world. They just inhabit victim's and perpetrator's mentally challenged worlds.

On the other hand, this one was by the book. Not in terms of how it was told - that is still a psychological masterwork - but in terms of the lack of a compelling reveal. Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely a reveal. But it's a reveal that doesn't live in a twisted reality, so it doesn't send shivers up and down your spine. On top of that, the ending is decidedly grim but also contains hope, which is usually in short supply at the end of her novels. I have ideas for why French has done this, and I think it stems from a tiny bit of pandering. Pandering to political correctness, to clarify. I could be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong, but it left an odd taste in my mouth."
"I love Tana French's writing, but this one had many cliches and unnecessary detail - especially at the beginning. When I began to skim it, I got caught in the plot and pulled into the surprisingly complicated resolution."
"I didn’t like Antoinette Conway when she appeared in the last Dublin Murder Squad book, but I adore this series, so I gave ‘The Trespasser’ a go.

Turns out, Conway is one of my favourite characters (second only to Frank MacKay).

In this instalment, Conway and her partner Stephen Moran pull what appears to be a dime-a-dozen domestic disturbance. Unhappy, but conscientious to a fault, they investigate and turn up evidence that points directly at one of their own.

Meanwhile, Antoinette has to weigh her devotion to the job against that tension and hostility of her colleagues. She has never fit in with the squad, and is beginning to think she never will.

As always, Tana French does a remarkable job of creating the character of Antoinette - the voice is pitch perfect, and you feel like you know her from the very first page. As the book progresses, we learn more and more about her, which makes us like her sometimes more and sometimes less. By the end, Antoinette is as flawed and human as any of us are and I, for one, loved her for it.

The plot is fascinating, and I was truly surprised by the solution (although, to be fair, I never make much of an effort to figure it out - that ruins my fun). I really appreciated the difficult questions French asks about loyalty and the ways in which it can distort reality.

French has created a wonderful, textured, complicated world that elevates her work above the mass of crime fiction out there. I can’t wait for the next one.

"
"The Trespasser perfectly encompasses the essence of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. It has a relatable lead character, a nice dose of intrigue/drama, and the journey is much more important (and admittedly, more worthwhile) than the destination.

Conway is hard, but the inner workings of her mind make it clear she isn't just that way. She doesn't dwell, but she does have a rather ongoing conversation with herself questioning the actions of those around her. The concept of the inner monologue and daydreams/fantasies ends up playing a big role in the book in a rather interesting manner. For readers who have trouble turning off the voice in their head that dissects everything, Conway is going to feel very familiar.

French continues to excel at making her detective series into more of a slice-of-life character study than an actual mystery. Perhaps this is a turn off for some readers, but her ability to make all of the characters come to life--not just the lead character of the particular novel--is remarkable. The final reveal is perhaps a bit anti-climatic compared to the path taken to get there, but no more or less so than any of the other series' tales. It leaves the reader wanting more, perhaps, but not necessarily unsatisfied.

Overall, the quality and style of The Trespasser was exactly what I was wanting from a Dublin Murder Squad book--my main regret was reading it so quickly."
Good writing! Solid mystery - good adventure in Ireland :-)
"The Trespasser by Tana French
449 pages

What’s it about?
This Irish mystery centers on Detective Antionette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran. Antoinette is the perpetual outsider on the murder squad while her partner Stephen Moran is the likable new young detective. Luckily for Antoinette, Stephen seems to get her. Antionette is on the verge of leaving when she is handed a new case. This case will test her relationship with her partner, as well as her resolve to remain a detective.

What did I think?
This was classic Tana French, and I enjoy losing myself in a good Tana French novel. Lots of Irish slang and Irish atmosphere, along with a good mystery, shape all of Tana Frenchs' novels.

Should you read it?
This was a classic who-dun-it with a little Ireland thrown in for color. If you like a well-written mystery, then I recommend “The Trespasser”.

Quote-
“The case comes in, or anyway it comes to us, on a frozen dawn in the kind of closed-down January that makes you think the sun’s never going to drag itself back above the horizon. Me and my partner are finishing up another night shift, the kind I used to think wouldn’t exist on the Murder Squad: a massive scoop of boring and a bigger one of stupid, topped off with an avalanche of paperwork. “

"I look forward to each Tana French novel. And The Trespasser was another excellent entry. The main character, Antoinette Conway, is half Irish, but with an unknown father who was evidently of darker skin. Because of her complexion and hair, she maintains a defensive posture among the 'lads' of the Murder Squad. And this attitude informs much of her personal tension throughout the novel. It took awhile for me to understand some of the slang used by the characters, and that caused me some confusion early on. Once I was used to the vernacular, the language added to the atmosphere. The plot was convoluted, but I expect that in a Tana French novel. And it was intricate enough that it kept me wondering, as it did Conway and her partner, nice-guy intuitive Stephen Moran. The Trespasser is both plot and character driven, which makes for a most satisfying read. "
"**I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review**

Tana French's novels are about things falling apart- people, families, situations, hopes, goals. The book begins with a happy family, or an easy-to-solve crime, but as you read, the cracks begin to appear, more and more. Despite this, they somehow all end happily (or at least not sadly), and she crafts characters and prose in a way that always reminds me of videos of glass breaking in slow motion.

I've consistently enjoyed Ms. French's novels, but am more interested in her female leads than the men of the Murder Squad, so I kept my fingers crossed that I'd get an arc of The Trespasser. I did, and it did not disappoint. The first few chapters felt a bit slow, while the plot was being set up, but the first plot twist got me hooked. After that, I spent most of each day waiting to be done with work so I could keep reading!

Antoinette Conway was a perfect main character- imperfect as a person, but consistently in character and someone I enjoyed meeting. I'm a character-driven reader, so I loved that The Trespasser didn't rush, just gave me plenty of time to learn about the characters and how they saw the world around them.

Dark mysteries aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I will be recommending this one the next time I can! Thanks to NetGalley, Tana French, and Penguin Group Viking for this ARC."
"Major spoilers ahead, as in who dunnit.For much of this book, I kept thinking that while great, it wasn't as good as some of my other favorites, such as Faithful Place. There, the memory and past experience of the detective is a major peice of the story, as he must reconsicle what happened all those years ago.Here, upon reflection, the past of Conway is told more subtly, especially her mistreatment by the other detectives. The murder she and her partner are investigating seems straightforward: the boyfriend must have killed the young woman. They follow a few blind alleys, partly mislead by how she's been mistreated--she suspects she is being set up. The last quarter of the book is a powerful, blow-it-up story. One of the detective, McCann, was involved in the investigation of young woman's father's disappearance years ago. He does track the guy down, but decides to protect his wife by telling her the case remained unsolved. Fastforward 15 years, and Aislinn Murray wants to find out what really happen. She tacks MCann down, then physically transforms herself into something irrsistable, and befreinds, then seduces him. She then meets a young man she really, really likes and McCann finds out and kills her impulsively.The interview by Conway and her partner and the follow up by their boss is well done. The writing is so sharp and evocative. "
"I'm not sure why I read this book -- it's not my usual kind of book to read, I'm not a reader of crime fiction, procedural-type plotting, etc. -- except that the raving reviews were everywhere, including in places I usually pay close attention to. It sat in my Kindle for about a month until I was on a long-haul flight....and then the hours flew by as I consumed the story. Couldn't read it fast enough, couldn't wait to get on to the next bit of story. The language was great fun, the plotting was magnificent, and the Dublin English was (as always) fun to listen in on. I loved prickly old Antoinette, even when she was being blindly hard and blind to her own stuff -- the same stuff she was being critical of in poor Aislinn. And in fact that kind of work is what elevates this from a standard crime story; French has keen insights into psychological truths, and presents them with a literary flourish that never gets in the way of a great, fun read.

For me, the decision of whether to give 4 or 5 stars centers on whether I'd read the book again, and I probably won't read this one again just because I know how it turns out (and she does such a great job of keeping you guessing, that's a big part of the fun!) so 4.5 it will be. But I just might buy some of the other books in the series because really, this was such an intelligent, well-written, fun book to read."
"I received a advance copy of this book as part of a GoodReads giveaway.

I have really enjoyed all of the books in the Dublin Murder Squad series, and this latest installment was no exception.

Tana French does police procedural extremely well, but there is always an added element to the mystery that is so well crafted and explored. In The Trespasser, Detective Antoinette Conway investigates the murder of a woman whose father abandoned her in her childhood. Conway's own personal history parallels the victims in ways that disrupt and confront her throughout the investigation. As with many of French's books, her protagonist must reckon with their past - or at least their memory of it - in order to successfully work the case.

While few of French's readers will ever be in a position to work a murder case on the Dublin Murder Squad, many of us have childhood memories or even adult traumas that have shaped who we are and how we do our work. French's characters reckon with these forces in different ways, choosing revenge, self re-invention, or self alienation.

I highly recommend The Trespasser (and all of Tana French's earlier books) as superbly executed mystery/thrillers that also explore the nuances of human memory and memory's reliability with depth and insight.
"
"The first book that I have read by Tana French it is one of a series of books about the Murder Squad in Dublin. Apparently each novel concerns a different member of the squad so it didn’t matter that I hadn’t read the previous books.
Antoinette Conway is the lead detective here, she has a hard time settling into her job. Some of the other detectives give her a hard time but she also doesn’t do anything to help herself. I had quite a lot of sympathy for her partner Steve Moran.
The case they are investigating appears to be a domestic but neither of them are convinced. Some of the scenarios they come up with appear to be farfetched but as you read further and begin to work out what could have happened it becomes more believable.
The best parts of the novel for me was when the police were questioning suspects and witnesses. I found each occasion mesmerizing especially the ones that included Breslin. I loved the way that whoever they were questioning was manipulated into revealing their feelings or suspicions.
Definitely a series that I will look at more closely in the future, its great for anybody who likes police procedural fiction.
With thanks to the publisher for the copy via NetGalley."
"Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are partners now and juniors in the Castle's Murder Squad. They teamed up in The Secret Place. Here their humorous banter forms a light motif to a darkening plot world. They are very much on their toes with their newest case, a domestic, which they have to work on a short leash, with an experienced detective acting as 'granny' alongside them, and reporting every night to O'Kelly, their 'gaffer' or chief. Conway feels hazed by the Squad, even considering leaving for private work as a bodyguard. But nothing is really as it seems, as author French reveals in an almost fantasmic, bravura performance, collapsing and reinvigorating the case through each interview, cctv search, and lab report. The victim's backstory echoes Conway's own early life and so compounds are feelings of complicity in her struggles with Moran to get the 'solve.'

This title produces the same compulsive reading as her earlier titles-- you are too nervous to put it down. It's very well done and at least a four star, but my favorites of all her books are Faithful Place and In the Woods, which incorporate more character history than this one.
Disclaimer: I wrote this review honestly as a quid pro quo for receiving a free arc copy."
"The beauty of Tana French's novels is, although they are in a series, you don't need to have read the previous ones in order to enjoy them - if you have, that just adds an extra dimension to them. Each one focuses on a different character who appeared in the previous novel. This is the sixth book, and is up to her usual high standard.

Narrated by Antoinette Conway, whose only ally on the Murder Squad is Steven Moran, she tries her best to investigate the murder of a young woman while constantly having to look over her shoulder at her fellow Murder Squad detectives. Being the only woman on the team, she is not treated well - but, as it's her narration, you're never sure if she's being a bit paranoid. The story is not so much about the case, as about the mind games all the detectives play with each other and with those they question and interrogate. There are lots of twists and turns as Conway and Moran get deeper into the truth of who the murderer might be. Although, as a Sebadoh fan I couldn't help but picturing Eric Gaffney every time the young detective Gaffney was mentioned!

This is a cut above your usual police procedural, and I'd recommend it to everyone - not just crime fans."
"This installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series is as much about the crime investigation as about Detective Conway’s struggle with the other detectives in her own department. She investigates murders despite continually being faced with the harassment, criticism, and outright thwarting of her efforts to solve cases. Only her partner Steve Moran seems to be on her side. Currently the case the pair are investigating involves a young woman who was murdered in her home. What at first appears to be a slam-dunk with the boyfriend as the perpetrator, begins to look more complex the more Conway and Moran dig into the victim’s past. But when the path leads too close to home, Conway knows the line she might need to cross will bring her even more trouble with the department. The book was a bit too long and the pace lagged at times. Conway’s suspicions about her fellow murder detectives attempts to derail her, are a bit convoluted and protracted. Still, French has a marvelous way of depicting police in a human way that makes the story about more than the crime. She excels at humanizing police officers, showing their insecurities and flaws. Her crime dramas are complex, filled with subterfuge and sparkling dialog. "
"Antoinette Conway is an amazing character. Among the many superlatives that could be applied to her, she is definitely the most unromantic lead character I have encountered in a long time; a refreshing change. This novel is extremely well crafted. It can be dense going in places. Tana French has Conway relate every interview in word-by-word detail so there is no place in this book for those annoying little sudden reveals that pop up in so many mysteries. You know the ones where, in the last 20 pages, we are suddenly informed whodunit as the detective, with a flourish, lets us in on the bit of information that she/he has been hiding from us all along. In this novel, the reader sees as Conway does...and she shares her impressions and thoughts and confusions with the reader as she sorts through the evidence and the interviews. This might be quite boring but Conway has a tongue like a razor and an eye for the truth. It is not always easy to find the truth in the stories that people tell. Each witness sees the events through the veil of their own past experiences. It is the mark of a French's skill that, when the veils are revealed, one by one, for what they are and where they came from, the truth is real and deep and movingly perceived by Conway. "
"Personal note: This audiobook + a 12 hour road trip to Reno = my whole family saying ""shite"" in their best Irish accents when something even remotely inconvenient happens to them.

All around this was an incredible book. The mystery sucked you in, the details gave so much room for so many guesses, the characters were memorable and the pacing was absolutely incredible-- I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the very last page!

Antoinette is faced with a seemingly simple murder-- a couple's spat gone so wrong it's left a body. The dinner is laid out, the boyfriend was expected at the time of the murder, and she's been punched so hard her jaw is broken and her body has been left bleeding on the floor. The twist? Everything's been wiped of prints and the stove burners were turned off-- very clear headed actions for a couple's spat/homicide. Was it the smitten boyfriend? Could it have been an angry relative? Something more mysterious?

You will waffle throughout the entire novel ALL THE WAY UP TO THE END on what truly happened to this poor girl and who caused it. It was a really enjoyable read with a very strong and aggressive female lead. I loved it. I will absolutely be reading more from this series."
"Such a great book, and I think the audio version only made it better. This felt like a unique thriller to me because it had both an engaging plot and well developed characters. I loved all the detail, especially when she was describing the way detectives think and work (interviewing witnesses and suspects, evaluating evidence, testing out one another's theories). I also liked learning more about Ireland and picking up on the Irish lingo. Definitely a lot of foul language and obviously some disturbing scenes (it's a murder mystery, after all), so not for the faint of heart.

This is the sixth in a series, but the first one I read. I generally do not read books in a series out of order, but this was a pick for my online book club, and I'd been assured that I could make an exception with this series. That seemed to be true; it was a stand-alone story, and I didn't feel like I was missing anything, but I enjoyed it so much that I am definitely going to go check out the rest of the series (in order). I'm hoping to catch snippets about the characters from this book in the earlier ones (each book apparently is told from a different character's point of view, with the other characters just playing more minor roles)."
"Of the 6 books in the series so far this and The Likeness are my 2 favorites. Author does a good job describing people, places, and conditions. Well plotted. Kept me engaged.

When this book sticks to being a police procedural it is excellent. when I first started reading it I was pleasantly surprised that the normal psychological baggage that haunts French's main characters was not evident, but that didn't last. Conway is a woman of color in an otherwise all white male murder squad, so she is the odd person out and subject to more hazing than normal. French beats this like a rented mule until I couldn't say if it was as bad as Conway thinks or if she takes everything as an attack. She alienates everyone including her partner and her commander. For her own sanity she should get out of the squad or figure out how to live with the rest of its members. As I wrote, the investigative parts of the story are excellent. Maybe a third of the way in French drops a few hints that led me down a different path than the detectives. I was surprised they didn't add this line of investigation especially later when it turned out to be the correct one. A good addition to the series. I look forward to the next one.
"
I LOVE Tana French and think this was a definite winner in her Dublin Murder Squad series. She's got a way with making everything seem just a little bit more creepy than it really should be. There's always a thread that unravels and whoa does it unravel here when they really find out more about the victim. Definitely read French's other books. My favorite is the Likeness. A book I still can't get out of my mind.
"Getting to know Antoinette Conway from The Secret Place a lot better, and also her partner Steve Moran. A woman is murdered, looks like domestic violence, but was it really ? The story is slow and full of detail, but Tana French is a master. "

"This book was long. Very long. I kept thinking the mystery was almost solved, but then I'd check and see there were still 6 hours left in the audiobook. Speaking of the audioversion, I did enjoy the Irish accents - an element that wouldn't have been there in the paper version.

Plot was good - lots of back and forth with different possible solutions that all had to be explored. The protagonist thought everyone was out to get her and that was partly the case. I don't even really remember that much now. The murder and mystery of solving the crime itself was really good. But other aspects of the book and characters makes me think I'll be slow to pick up another Tana French novel again. Also there was a toooonnnn of language - which is expected I guess, given the department and Irish setting. The book would have been shorter if that extra dialogue was cut out.

I think the entire story took place over a very short period of time. The first like 30% of the story was in a 24 hour period - reminded me a bit of a season of the show ""24."" It was interesting seeing if Rory really was the killer or not, as the prime suspect. The detectives would go back and forth and back and forth and I had my hypothesizes but I enjoyed seeing that unfold. It just took longer than I wanted."
"Antoinette Conway is a tough as nails detective in the Murder Squad who is getting no respect from fellow detectives and is, along with her partner, hoping to finally get a case to prove them wrong. They get the case—a woman murdered in her home—but as they keep going in circles trying to figure out what happened Conway starts to doubt herself. French brilliantly places readers inside this investigation without ever making you feel like you want to hurry things along. And the audiobook has a nice narration by Irish actress Hilda Fay. (You can dive into the series here without feeling lost—most of the books in the series change the characters, although this is Conway’s second appearance—but if you’re looking for a recommendation on how to read the series Rioter Jessica Woodbury wrote a great post.)

The Trespasser by Tana French

Thanks to the good folks at Netgalley and the publishers Hodder and Stoughton, I was privileged to meet a great acerbic female lead in the shape of Antoinette Conway, whilst the butt of some quite obvious sexual harassment,and bullying she holds her own and solves the crime with the help of her partner Stephen.

She is not a formulaic character, not the stock “dark tortured soul”that crime drama authors tend to think all readers want to see, she is sarcastic, funny but vulnerable and just as susceptible to human frailty.

The mystery itself was twisty enough to hold attention until the end but it was the interplay between the officers of the squad that I found infinitely compelling with plenty of misogyny and ""banter"" that masks a much more sinister underbelly within the incident and interview rooms.

The revelation of the culprit is not too heavily signposted, and if forced to be critical, I have only one quibble and that is the ending seemed just a little rushed and a little unsatisfactory for our heroes somehow,despite getting ""Their Man"".

I still highly recommend The Trespasser.

Tana French at her very best!
"
"The plot is seemingly straight forward but you do get it right away that it is not. It wouldn't
be a Tana French book if it were. We have Antoinette and Stephen - one abrasive, aggressive and clever and the other diplomatic, quiet and clever. A winning team whichever way one looks at it. The crime is seemingly straightforward as well. A woman killed apparently by her boyfriend. All the signs point to it, and all the other senior detectives on the Squad believe it is so. They cannot understand Antoinette dithering over the crime.


It seems to be too pat for our detectives and further investigations are called for, surreptitiously and without the knowledge of others on the Squad, also without the knowledge of their seniors. Both detectives know they are in for a host of trouble if word gets out and when the pointers are to one of their own, they know they are in for a lot of trouble.

The twists and turns of this investigation keeps the reader on edge. The characterization of the detectives were spot on, each one different to the other and each one showing up the investigation in different ways.

"
"I love Tana French's work. Her writing is brilliant. When I read her, I often stop and shake my head at how she can turn a phrase, stringing words and concepts, and imagery together that I've personally never seen before. She's who I read to get my mind right before diving into my own writing. I've read all five books and could not wait for this 6th installment. Whereas I liked it a lot, because it's Tana French, I didn't love it. I didn't love Antoinette Conway. I respected the hell out of her. She was a smart, wry, and consistent character throughout who budged a little toward positive change at the end, but I did NOT like her. I longed for a second point of view throughout. Just like in The Secret Place, but no. I was ""stuck"" with Conway the entire time. She was entertaining...I think I enjoyed French's expertise and style more than I did the story. I thought the story dragged. I loved the writing, but didn't love the story. The Likeness and Faithful Place are my absolute favorites. I often pick them up, drop to a page and start reading at random. Love love love those books. The Tresspasser, not so much."
"I have been a huge fan of the Dublin Murder Squad series for about two years now. Every time I get my hands on one of the books I devour them in 1-3 days, often forcing myself to put them down so I can get other things done. But I have to admit, I was worried about The Trespasser somewhere around the halfway point. It wasn't gripping me like it normally would, the pool of suspects was so small, and I almost immediately had a good idea of who the murderer was that all the suspense of whodunnit was gone (and the suspense of ""why?"" just wasn't as interesting). Still, the last hundred or so pages fell back into that classic Tana French slow burn thriller as the horrible truth finally comes to light that a 4-star rating felt appropriate. I loved having Conway as a narrator, I'm pleased with how her narrative wrapped up, and I'm very curious to see who French chooses as the next narrator, assuming there is another (please please please).

Last line:


Then we start off across the courtyard, arguing, to get a few pints and a few hours' kip before it's time to head back and find out what's in there."
"I love this series. I love that each book focuses on a different detective, and that occasionally you'll catch a glimpse of one who was featured in a previous book. The wind-up of this book got me wondering more about the chief, O'Kelly, and I'm half tempted to flip through the previous volumes in the series to glean more of a picture of his character.

In my review of French's previous book, I said that I wished we could have gotten a better picture of Antoinette Conway, the lone woman on the Murder Squad. In that book, she came across as having a huge chip on her shoulder. This book puts her at center stage, and you see that she both does and does not have reasons to be so prickly. And this is what prevents me from giving the book 5 stars instead of 4. With such a paranoid protagonist, some of the plot machinations get a bit fatiguing, and French's attention to atmospheric detail (in the incident room, in the car on the way to question a suspect, on a stakeout) become a bit suffocating. I was a bit surprised by the last 2 pages, and I look forward to the next installment of the series, to see what comes of Detectives Conway and Moran."
"I usually love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad Series, but I didn't like Detective Conway in The Secret Place, and I hoped she wouldn't be the main character in the new book in the series. I began reading this one knowing that Conway is the protagonist, but I guess I hoped that like in ""Broken Harbour"" and Scorcher Kennedy, by the end I would feel I got to know and understand why she is the way she is. At the end of ""The Trespasser"", I still don't like Detective Conway nor care one bit about her! As for the mystery, it's a basic whodunit with the Barbie doll like Aislinn being found dead in her house. Detectives Conway and Moran try to find out if her boyfriend or someone else killed her. The story kept me turning pages. However, without spoiling anything, I can say so much of the resolution to the mystery revolves around the abrasive personality of ""everybody's out to get me"" Detective Conway, that if you strongly dislike her character, this book may not be your cup of tea. Ms. French writes so well that I still managed to enjoy this book, but it didn't get that 5th star from me that a couple of Ms. French's earlier books did because of the unlikeable Detective Conway."
"Loved this book!! It's an atmospheric police mystery. The best part was I didn't see the murderer coming like a freight train. There are twists and turns but they are subtle. This is a really well written novel. Newbies to the Dublin Murder squad, detectives Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran, have yet to establish their bona fides or ""make their bones"" as they say in the mob. As a result, they are always assigned dull and routine domestic cases.

The murder of young, beautiful Aislinn Murray looks like it might another domestic lovers' quarrel on B A D. But is there more to this murder than meets the eye? Conway and Moran set aside a lot of circumstantial evidence and dig deeper to the incredulity of senior detectives in the squad. There is no love lost between Antoinette, the lead detective on the case, and most of the squad. She is a tough cookie suffering a hostile work environment. Many would love to trip her up. In this environment Conway and Moran must solve a murder without falling on their face, turning against each other, or doubting their instincts."
"I am a huge fan of Tana French. I have read all six of her novels, in order. I now eagerly anticipate each new book. I thoroughly enjoyed The Tresspasser, but it's the first time I only gave one of her books 4 stars. It is tough to pin down exactly why it wasn't on par with her others. I found the murder mystery less compelling. Detective Conway is tough as nails and I especially enjoyed the ways in which she held her own against her male counterparts, but her constant paranoia regarding how everyone else perceives her got annoying. Then again, she did not completely fall apart the way some of French's protagonist detectives have, so perhaps that was also less compelling (though also a relief because I liked her character). Much of the story took place at the police office, and while this was interesting I still think I liked it less. The interview scenes were some of the best, though. Overall, still very suspenseful and a well-plotted mystery. Even better to listen to on audiobook. I will continue to recommend Tana French. I am curious who will lead in the next novel as no character from this one stood out as potential. Thank you to Penguin Random House for the audiobook! "
"From my favorite Irish author comes another Murder squad book. As usual, the characters are no nonsense detectives whose accents you can hear as you read and whose attitudes leave no doubt as to what they are thinking and feeling. The stories are always involved and the outcomes a bit of a surprise.
Antoinette and Stephen are partnered up and a seemingly simple domestic is thrown at them to clear up, but of course it turns out to be much more than that and they leave no stone unturned to solve the case. Hard-shelled Detective Conway has had it rough in the Squad being the only woman and she finds it hard not to think everyone is against her. She lets no one in and even her partner, Detective Stephen Moran has to convince her he's on her side as they work together to bring a killer to justice.
"
"When Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran are handed a case it looks at first like the usual domestic violence stuff that Conway feels is always dumped on them. Aislinn Murray, a pretty, blond young girl is found in her perfect little living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. But Antoinette feels something isn't right. She's sure she's seen the girl before and other detectives are trying to push into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, even though the evidence seems week. Somewhere, hiding in the shadows, is another person and another story for Aislinn. Well written with a great dialogue, the book could have used a bit of tighter editing in the middle. "
"Review to follow. In the meantime:
It's a fine book. I have found all her books compelling. For me, this was not quite as compelling as the others. But it's good."
Another good story about the Dublin Murder Squad!!
"4.5 stars - twisty and turny and tense, and everything satisfies. I'll definitely read the rest of the series. "
"(Audible; Hilda Fay, narrator) This is a sad story about a female victim who is a tease but who is also trying to find her way. Countless twists and turns and a whole lot of lying in this psychological + police procedural crime fiction. Not a lawyer in sight. (No lawyers allowed until a perp is charged.) Rough language, rough cops, who do not generally like or trust each other. Insights into how interrogation works and how police work difficult cases through examining evidence and working out hypothetical scenarios. The story is told by Detective Antoinette Conway, the sole woman on the murder squad, whose crudeness, chip on her shoulder, and Dooblin dialect make for a tough, 18-hour listen. Hilda Fay, the Audible narrator, does all the authentic Dooblin dialects, which are difficult to take for long, with their glo'al stops, their 'hors' (= hers), and 'morders' (= murders) and 'haytchs' (=h), and many more. Sorry, but 'ugh'; I prefer Sean Duffy from Carrickfergus, whose Northern Irish dialect via Gerard Doyle, is much easier on the ears. I've listened to all of Tana French's murder mysteries, but her Broken Harbor is the only one that really touched me."
"This is the first mystery by Tana French that I've read, so admittedly I didn't realize this was part of a series (Dublin Murder Squad). I was worried it would leave me confused not starting on #1 but it didn't seem to rely too much on anything from other books. I thought it was a really good look at what a murder investigation is really like. At times, I wanted more reveals and felt it was moving slowly. However, it's probably more realistic that not everything happens like it does in the TV shows and I appreciated this. To me (as someone who listens to too many true crime podcasts), this book was like getting into the minds of the detectives you hear about in those cases. It was really interesting to get the perspective of Detective Conway and how the case affected her. I also really enjoyed getting to learn about her past and how she got to be a detective. The dynamics of the squad was intriguing as well; everything from the relationships between positions to how they chose ""personas"" while conducting interviews. The ""big reveal"" was also well done and got me off guard which I enjoyed. I'll definitely be reading more of the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French!"
"This entire book hinges on the moment when Antoinette discovers who's been stalking her. It's her long-lost father, and at first I hated that part, because it seemed to on-the-nose for me: here she is, investigating the murder of a woman who only wanted to find her missing dad, and the murdered woman never gets to see him again but her's Antoinette, getting what the victim wanted. Except Antoinette didn't want to met her father, who abandoned her and her mother, and I didn't want to be forced to read about Antoinette interacting with this person who she had no desire to meet or interact with. Fortunately, I don't have to read about that, because Antoinette gets rid of her father quick but the brief encounter leads her investigation into a whole other direction. So her father showing up was used as a way to advance the plot, instead of some character-building bit about a girl getting on with the parent who abandoned her. I highly appreciated the way that was done. This was a fun and interesting read, I've enjoyed the books I'v read in this series."
"Tana French has delivered another successful entry in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This one features Stephen Moran and Antoinette Crowley as they attempt to solve the murder of Aislinn Murray. Although there is an obvious suspect, Moran and Crowley aren't satisfied and dig deeper. The secrets they uncover lead to a twist that made for an ending that brought justice for the victim, but was also a bit unsettling, Along the way, there is solid police work as well as much introspection on Crowley's part. She deals with issues involving her father as well as harassment from the males on the squad. French allowed her characters to stumble, but also to grow and change their minds. This is a great book that kept me turning the pages.

Notes: Even though this is a series, each of the novels can stand alone. I've enjoyed the other five books in the series in audio, but found the print experience to be good as well.

I received an advanced reading copy from Penguin's First to Read program in exchange for my review."
"Long review short: It's a great addition to the series and has me interested in revisiting the rest of the books.

I've had the same experience with each of the five previous Tana French books:
1. Dang, she's a really good writer.
2. The premise seems implausible, though.
[2a. Dang it, if I hadn't read the last one so quickly I might remember some of these characters. I wonder what I'm missing.]
3. Still, she's good. She has me hooked. I need to know what happens.
4. This is compelling. I'm invested in these characters.
5. About 90% of the mystery is solved. The rest of it could be wrapped up in about two pages. WHY ARE THERE ONE HUNDRED PAGES LEFT?!
6. Okay, it was good but now I'm exhausted and really why was this book over 400 pages?!

This time I had to spread the reading out over several days (my kids insist on being cared for and I'm too old to function well after all nighters). Anyway, a slower appreciation of the character work and plotting made it a more enjoyable read than the first five books."
"I listened to The Trespasser by Tana French and I loved it. I thought it was an exceptional novel with an unbeatable combination of an engrossing procedural story coupled with a reader, Hilda Fay, who was so believable and true in her interpretation of the characters that I was sorry when the book came to an end.

Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran investigate a domestics call made to the local precinct. Upon arriving to the address they find the death of Aislinn Murray, a young woman, meticulous in her appearance, who was preparing for a dinner date in her home but winds up with the back of her head crushed. Was it an accident, manslaughter or murder? With a variety of suspects and a murder squad tormenting Detective Conway, the novel takes the reader on a suspenseful roller coaster ride.

This audio book was used as an incentive to walk each morning, and walk I did. I couldn't wait to get back to the story. This is also the perfect book for long car rides. 4 1/2 stars.

"
"Total page turner, which was frustrating because I only had this on audiobook and if I'd had the print version I could have torn through it much faster.

For people like me, who were put off by the last book's toe-dipping into the world of The Craft, the great news is that while there are some moments requiring suspension of disbelief, there are no Sabrina the Teenage Witch moments. It's funny to read reviews of book #6, which reference #5 as either the strongest or weakest of the entire series. No one seems to think it was middle of the road.

This book was almost a break with the tradition of bringing a minor-ish character from the last book into the forefront in the next. Instead we focused on the same set of cops as the last, albeit with a narrator change. By the end of the book I was hoping she'd keep us with them for yet another go 'round. Time will tell, but not only would I love to read about these two again, (mild spoiler) there weren't many background characters left standing to bring into the foreground for book #7."
"Well-plotted, good dialogue (can really hear those Dublin colloquialisms); interesting characters, including Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran whom we have met before, this time as partners and leading an investigation into the death of a young woman at her home in which at first it seems that the boyfriend is the most likely suspect. In the background is an unpleasant atmosphere in the squad, and Antoinette is convinced that her days there are numbered. Her paranoia proves exaggerated but there is an element of truth in it, and she has to work out why she is being pushed to come to a quick conclusion about the murder. The victim, whom we never meet alive, is a particularly interesting character who as it turns out was operating almost like an undercover detective herself. The episode with Antoinette's long-lost father is a bit unsatisfactory, and seems only to serve as a red herring and as a counterpoint to the victim's own story and background. The ending is sensitively managed and one wonders what wil happen next in the squad. Liking this series very much."
"The book was slow starting out, but like many crime novels, once the back story was established and I realized what was going on, I could not put the book down until the end.

The story was extremely well-written and the characters all were so incredibly believable.

Detectives Antoinette Conway and Moran seemingly qualify as the black sheep of the department of the detective division of the Dublin police force known as ""Murder D's. As the only female Murder D, Conway has developed a high level of paranoia, much of which is justified.

So she does her job the only way she knows how: with a giant chip on her shoulder and a ""me against the world"" attitude that may not be as warranted as she thinks.

French masterfully tells the twisted story of a murder that appears to be a simple domestic case, but as the story develops, appearances become incredibly deceiving as Conway and Moran get loads of ""help"" and unsolicited advice from veterans on this case that just may be best suited for the ""newbies"" on force after all.
"
"Another excellent detective novel from Tana French. In this go-round, two relatively new detectives on the Dublin Murder Squad are given what looks like a straightforward case in which a young woman is found dead in her apartment; she apparently was struck in the face and fell onto the edge of a fireplace. Her boyfriend, who had a dinner date at her place, is the prime suspect. The detectives have nothing but circumstantial evidence against the boyfriend, yet the higher-ups seem in an unusual hurry to charge him and close the case. On top of that, leaks to the press, apparent evidence tampering, and suspicious behavior among the squad have the detectives wondering whether they've stumbled onto something much deeper. French adds to the rising tension by her choice of a biracial woman as one of the lead detectives. She's convinced, and not without justification, that at least some of her colleagues and superiors want her out because of her gender and race, and this may be clouding her ability to sort out the facts and know who to trust. "
"4.5 stars for a purposefully-paced whodunnit that kept me guessing and second guessing and second guessing my second guesses for most of the read. It took me almost 200 pages to really get sucked into the story, and I think that's because I wasn't sure if I liked the MC, Detective Antoinette Conway who isn't so much an unreliable narrator but a self saboteur and her own worst enemy at times -- though I did end up liking Conway more and more as the story went on.

After several weeks of picking the book up and setting it down, once author Tana French started to masterfully peel back the layers, I was hooked and finished the last 250 pages in a day.

This was my first Dublin Murder Squad book, despite it being the sixth in the series (it was my November Book of the Month pick) and I'm definitely looking forward to going back and starting from the beginning. That being said, I didn't feel lost, despite picking up the book late in the series and I definitely felt comfortable (maybe not the right word given the tone and setting of the book haha) in the world French created."
"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the entire Tana French Dublin Murder Squad series, and I have to say that The Trespassers is my favorite. That is no inconsequential accolade, given how engrossing and well written the rest of the series is. It is not necessary that you read the entire series, or even in order. French ingeniously takes a minor character from the previous book and puts that character center stage in the next story.
The Trepassers is not an action packed book, but it is nonetheless a page turner. At its heart it is all about the stories we tell ourselves; the stories we believe and through which we see the entire world. And of course, about the consequences of those beliefs. As with all her books, the characters are flawed: Conway has a chip on her shoulder a mile wide, and Moran is a get-along milquetoast (or is he?). Those flaws are recognizable and very real.
I recommend French's books constantly. She has become an author I will always read, without consulting the reviews beforehand. Start your odyssey with French. Today.
"
"Did not disappoint. I look so forward to each Dublin Murder Squad book as it comes out, and this was very solid and brought together the things I have come to anticipate in one of her books. It's good writing, it's interesting story, believable characters, and because it's a mystery, each phase of ""working theory"" seemed completely plausible given the information available at the time, which I always find especially impressive. I've gotten very critical in my old age about mysteries that throw out a couple of possible scenarios, and they're so dumb that you, the reader, are thinking ""well, obviously not that one ..."" so you end up eliminating them right away based on poor narrative construction rather than the evidence within the world of the novel.

All the while I was reading, I was thinking that I definitely want to go back and read the series again to see who comes up in the background. And, of course, wondering which background characters are going to show up in future books (I have my guess).

"
"Another solid offering from French

Tana French never disappoints. This one feels real, thanks to her superb way with words. She doesn't just paint a picture, but she gives every scene the benefit of all five senses . She then flushes out thoughts and depth of emotion. I'll be first in line for her next one. Oh, and the storyline was solid as well."
"Hilda Fay made this an interesting story to listen to. As with most of French's police tales, there seemed to be a lot of angst but a pretty good mystery to go along with it. "
Like her writing style 
"You can go read all the reviews on this, and they will all say about the same.

Character driven, minute details of a police procedural, a few false trails, loyalty, great story, well written, etc., ad naseum.

At my age, like #5, it is hard for this old brain to hold on to all the details of all that dialogue, but, it's worse at the beginning, and more narrated in the rest of the book.

There are perhaps a few too many 'ideas' which take hold, dragging me in direction a, only to be told, nope, not that way, go to b.

There are perhaps a few too many instances of real/imagined perceptions/realities about Conway by the rest of the squad which make resolution more difficult

But, damn, it seems like it would have actually happened that way.

I don't get to read Ms French that often - the last one in this series was over a year ago, but you don't really have to keep up, as each is 'mostly' stand alone. Her next two books are not in this series, so will see how they pan out.

"

AHHHHHH new Tana French!!! So intense and crazy!! This latest in her Dublin Murder Squad series focuses on rookie Antoinette and her partner, working the homicide of a pretty young woman, but maybe it's more than the usual domestic? I was sure I had figured it out very early on and so spent the entire book reading in an even more heightened state of tension, wondering if I was right, and then alternately being annoyed that neither detective was picking up the obvious. But I appreciated French's look at being the only woman on a police unit like that, and really sympathized with Antoinette. And I definitely thought French stuck the landing. I seriously could not put this down to go to bed, so it's the usual engrossing stuff--it just wasn't the strongest in this series, to me. B+.

__
A review copy was provided by the publisher. This book will be released in October."
"Antoinette Conway, the detective from The Secret Place is back in the fifth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Conway is a rough, abrasive detective with no friends in the Detective division except her affable partner, Steve Moran. The partners had been given a steady stream of domestic abuse cases until early one Sunday morning when they were handed the case of murder of an attractive young girl. The murder appeared to be result of a fight between 2 young lovers. However once Conway and Moran start investigating, they discovered that there is more to the case than they thought originally. They were constantly dogged by Conway's unpopularity in the Detective Squad and by the inexperience of Moran. However they finally were able to solve the mystery.
This is a long book but the author's skill at creating complex characters and at developing the complicated plot, will keep the reader interested."
"Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the Dublin murder squad - and the only person of colour. She's despised by the rest of the white male squad and, despite being tough as f**k, is plagued by the paranoia that comes from being targeted for being an outsider. So there's an extreme sense of schadenfreude but also a whole load of uncertainty when all the evidence points to one of her awful colleagues when a young woman is found dead in her flat. The character's struggle feels very real and I loved the unforgiving way French writes this character - she doesn't give in to any need to provide some soft edges or an origin story for why Conway is so tough just because she is female. I haven't read any of the five previous books in this series but this story stood completely on its own without the need for it. If you fancy a bit dark mystery thriller action on your next holiday, you should pick up a copy of this."
"A mysterious death. By a lover, a stranger....or a cop? I find books that rely on local dialect to drag. Maybe use it in a few lines to set the tone, if you must, but a book full of ""Howyas"" and ""shites"" are enough for me. She captures the giddiness and otherworldlyness of an affair. But also the sadness in it's silence and how one wants to talk and share the story, ""The wonder in his voice. He sounds like a teenager, lifting with joy and amazement, he sounds so tender you could bruise him with one wrong touch. Time after time it's left me gobsmacked. how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferciously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist outside their own heads. You put it out in the world so you can see that it is real. If she had written with that strength throughout the book, it would have been a masterpiece.

"
"Love Tana French's books. This one is about a really hard-boiled detective on the Murder Squad, Antoinette Conway. She has good reason to have that attitude. Not only is she the only woman on the Squad, but half Indian. Her mother had it on with an Indian student, and he is long gone. She is on the case of a young woman found dead, in her home-her skull; fractured by a fall , but also with facial injuries that point to her being punched before she fell and hit her head on the edge of her fireplace. It's obvious she was expecting company, as she was dressed in her best and had her table set for a romantic dinner. Antoinette is suspicious that there is more to it than a lover's quarrel. Her fellow detectives are pushing her to arrest the girl's new boyfriend, but the victim's best friend said she was in trouble and had been afraid for her. She is obviously, also, holding something back. Great plotting here and a very satisfying conclusion.,"
"This is my introduction to Ms. French, and I was not disappointed. However, I went into the book thinking it would be slightly different (my error), and that no doubt shades my opinion. Since it's a crime novel, I was expecting a hard boiled race to uncover clues and danger at every turn, in the vein of The Maltese Falcon or Bad Monkey, or a Grisham pot-boiler.
What I got was a thoughtful look at the tightrope walk of being a female detective in a man's world. There is as much inner dialogue and emotional baggage as there is procedural police work. There is as much self-discovery as there is uncovering evidence.
Indeed (switching my comparison to film), the pace is closer to slower tempo crime dramas like ""The Night Of"" or ""Broadchurch"", and just as engaging.
So, once I got into the story, I was sucked into it until the end.
Casting: I want to see Gabriel Byrne in the role of Breslin, Chris O'Dowd as Stephan Moran, and Freema Agyeman as Antoinette Conway."
"Love this series and was not disappointed by the latest addition! The interplay between the personal backstory of the Dublin murder squad lead detective, and the main case in each book, forms a subtle backdrop to each story and adds a very nice layer to the books. This is what makes Tana French novels unique other than their sheer elegance of prose/poetry.
This book's main character Conway (like Scorcher Kennedy in another book) is, let us say, more gritty than lyrical. Yet, her story of being the lone woman in a male-dominated profession, years of toughening herself up into having a thick skin and unwittingly making herself even more isolated by going it alone and rebuffing attempts to help, and giving back as good (or better) than she got is very relatable and results in her feeling more persecuted and targeted than the situation warrants.
Tight pacing (unlike some of her others - The Likeness comes to mind), good character development and at times chilling twists and turns."
"This is one of those ""I really need a half-star option""... I would probably go 3.5, but rounding up because I really like Tana French's books and the world that she's built. On the plus side, she does a nice job weaving the story through various ""who-dun-it"" possibilities making you wonder when did she introduce the one that will finally stick. This left me second guessing myself, revisiting previously discarded options, and opening up to the story. Now the down side... I don't specifically recall this from her previous books, but this one really seems to drag through minutiae more than before. Plot points and conversations that probably could have gone 5 pages went 12 and those that could have been 10 went 25. On one hand, much of it was the setup to where the story was going, but on the other hand it still felt like it was dragging a bit. All in all, an enjoyable read. Not my favorite of hers, but worth the time."
"This took me a surprisingly long time to read...I'm not sure if it was me or the book! It was a little slow with a lot of character building to a character (well characters since Detective Moran was the narrator in the last one) I thought we already knew pretty well from the last book. (But to be honest, I kinda forgot he was the narrator since I feel like I read The Secret Place a million years ago). Not that I'm complaining too much because Antoinette Conway is pretty amazing as a character and narrator - so sarcastic, so bitchy, and yet, so vulnerable, too. I felt frustrated and sad for her and wanted her to kick some serious ass!

Like French's other books, this is more about the detectives than about the crime. The crime is merely backdrop and circumstance. I love her books...and I'm totally conflicted about whether these should be movies or not. On the one hand, great stories and on the other - don't ruin the books!"
"So sad I feel inside. I have finished the last book written by Tana French and now I have to wait...sigh! and believe me this book is a good one and atypical for this author for two reasons at least: first of all It has the same detectives from her last book, which has been a no-no in the past and in second place the main subject in this book is not friendship which has been present in the other books, but disappointment.
An investigation of a simple murder (what is simple about murder You ask?) that leads to discover secrets hidden in the midst of the police force and the desultory traits in the lives of the main characters.
French has a knack to put losers at front and to make us feel bad about them, I give her that, but in the end We discover They all have a mirror that reflects us in them and that is the sad feeling We get hen We finish every single one of her books. How I love this woman for make me feel sad inside. Like The Who used to say: ""I Can't Explain""."
"This was a police procedural in the true sense of the word starring Detective Antoinette Conway as a rather bitter and sometimes paranoid officer investigating what's supposed to be a by the book domestic murder case of a young woman named Aislinn Murray. Except that Antoinette has doubts about this being so basic and it doesn't help that her partner Stephen Moran keeps whispering her ears other what if scenarios.

The problem with this story is that not much happens for the first 200 to 300 pages as everything seems to point towards a standard case with an obvious culprit. We also spend the majority of the time in the mind of Antoinette and lets face it, she's so bitter and angry that's it's not always a pleasant place to be.

Still I ended up being satisfied with how everything culminated in the case. This one requires patience due to its slow moving storyline. If you don't have it you may want to pass on this.

"
"Another brilliant murder mystery from Tana French. One reviewer commented about a slow pace and patience needed.............this is true. Through most of it, felt like an editor should have tweaked this book a bit. Lots of unnecessary conversation and minutiae. French's writing is masterful and tight enough to give readers plenty of knowledge about characters and plot w/o as much yak-yak and description.

That said, characters, plot twists and storytelling are amazing. A young woman is murdered, and a bit low on the totem pole murder squad members Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are tapped to investigate (with purpose as we find out later). Then pressured to wrap up quickly and arrest the woman's new boyfriend for murder. But both smell a rat, with Moran being more neutral and Antoinette scrapping and manipulating cleverly to keep the investigation going. Great plot twists.

Excellent!"
"After struggling with French's last two books, I really enjoyed this one. The book is long and the pace is a little slow for a thriller/mystery, but once you slow down with the writing you get to enjoy French's colorful writing. I love all of her Irish descriptions and inventive cursing. She (and the Irish) raise it to an art form. You can't help but love her snarky yet wounded Irish character and her naive and eager to please partner. I struggled with the plot a little, sometimes it seemed to bounce around a bit. It got a little burdensome the main character's paranoia and mistrust for everyone, but without giving any spoilers, it's all tied up neatly by the end.

French also paints a poignant picture of what it's like to be the child whose father has deserted her. It's difficult to read in parts and spot on. Really very well written. This was the last try for me with a Tana French book. But I'm hooked again. Solid 4*."
"I started this book when it came out in October, but soon after put it down for months. I read it maybe 5-10% at a time on my Kindle after Christmas. I'm used to French's books being a slow burn, but this one was especially slow. I didn't start to really get into it and fly through the book until about 2/3s of the way through! However it is good -- just slow.

What I liked most was the dual mystery in this story. There's the mystery whodunit but also the question of who's out to ""get"" Conway -- if anyone is at all? I appreciated the theme of people making up stories about their own lives that French wound through the book; I know some felt beaten over the head by it but I think reading the book over a longer period of time made it feel not so clobbering.

Like usual, I'd recommend this book. French's detective novels are never quick, 1-2 day reads for me, but they're always worth the time spent reading."
"This book isn't exactly what I'm used to. Most mystery are ""it's the end of the world"" type of intensity where your heart pounds to almost an heart attack. This book is slower, but that's not a bad thing. It's slow but it builds. My heart was pounding without it being overly intense. I think this book was awesome and a nice change of pace."
"Antoinette Conway was introduced to me by the Goodreads first reads program. I had not previously read anything by this author and had not read the books previously in the series. This story can stand on its own and I do not feel it necessary to have read the books prior. Detective Conway is handed a slew of bs cases constantly. Whether it be because she is woman in a world of men or simply that she doesn't play well with others, she ends up neck deep with her and her partner in a murder mystery. And of course it couldnt' be just a over zealous new boyfriend like everyone would have her believe. Or could it. Conway is caught between following her gut or writing it off as indigestion. Murder cases are hard enough to crack without feeling like your by yourself and everyone is out to sink you. But when little miss Barbie perfect victim begins to appear more than everyone is letting on, its up to Conway to figure out what she knew. Its kinda gritty and has that Bones mystery feel."
"Probably 4.5 stars. Tana French is such a great writer, and I love getting a different perspective on her characters in her different books. I definitely thought this was a great book. The only thing that kept it shy of 5 stars for me is that I figured out the answer pretty early on, and I was frustrated that the main character did not. I understand that the harassment she was dealing with had blinded her in many ways, and I appreciate what the author was doing with that and with the parallels between our narrator and the victim, but still... It bugged me. A little. But at 4.5 stars, it is still a great read; if you like police mysteries, you will highly enjoy this book. I am very grateful to NetGalley for providing me with an early copy. I have already ordered a copy for the library where I work and I expect it will jump off the shelves, as all of Ms French's books do."
"First let me say, I am a HUGE Tana French fan and this book did not disappoint!

I really like the Dublin Murder Squad series because it isn't driven by one character, it switches up from book to book and gives the reader a taste of lots of different personalities. The main D in this book, Moran is slowly losing her sanity due to daily harassment and intense working conditions. I love any book where the main character is a fully developed woman with a personality that doesn't hinge on pleasing a man.

All in all it was a great read, and I had trouble putting it down, especially as the noose started to tighten on the guilty party! If you love Irish police jargon, intricate webs of lies and kick-ass lady-detectives you will enjoy it too!

FULL DISCLOSURE: I was provided and ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review from Viking/Netgalley."
"Tana French is one of those writers that I greatly enjoy and admire and each time I hear a new book is coming out I eagerly look forward to it; and each time I read said new book, I realize she was even greater than I remembered. The Trespasser is not an exception - her writing is excellent, her ability to create flushed out characters and an overall feel of a place is top drawer. But, sadly, I felt the actual mystery part of this, the 6th book following the Dublin Murder Squad, was lacking. It was overshadowed in many ways by the personal story of the main character, which at times felt almost overdone and difficult to read. I'd still recommend it, it's still worth reading, but perhaps it is only because her other books are so very very good, that this one doesn't stand up as well to them. "
"Tana French hasn't broken her stride with this one. As a reader, I trust her to be consistently good, and I loved this book. As always, the real meat comes from her nearly perfect characterization; there's a mystery, yes, but the story is really about the people. And I love the way she reveals layers to her characters, especially when she introduces them as a secondary character in a previous novel. Antoinette Conway might be my favorite narrator yet.

Mystery novels, for me, are usually a fun if formulaic escape for my brain. French delivers more. She can be bitingly funny, but she also has this remarkable ability to make me invest in her characters and ache at the end. The mystery is almost beside the point, and even a solve leaves behind a lingering feeling of melancholy because the people involved are all so messily human."
"I really enjoy this author although this was not my favorite book of her series about the Dublin Murder Squad. Score should be closer to 4.5 because the plot line and character development was every bit as thorough as her other books. Personally I just didn't like the lead character through most of the book....which is exactly what Ms French intended. Our protagonist has not a ""chip"" on her shoulder but rather the whole log....poor me, I'm being picked on in the Murder Squad. And her abrasiveness comes out loud and clear in her language which I found distracting. One of the positives (to me) in Ms. French's novels is that one can ""hear"" the characters while reading the book. In this case I just wanted to use ear plugs. The foul mouth was overdone throughout the book.
Otherwise it was a good read!"
"Tana French knows how to engage the reader and tell a good story. The prose is rhythmic. The voice feels authentic. In The Trespasser, French again demonstrates her skill at getting insider her characters’ heads and understanding their psychology and motivations. In this Dublin Murder Squad book, however, I found the police procedural play-by-play a bit tedious. The office politics kept my interest though, and the interrogations succeeded in being tense and edge-of-your-seat dramatic. The Trespasser contained wit and humor as well. Occasionally I found the characters in this novel annoying due to their paranoia, but the story was still engrossing. I highly recommend the Dublin Murder Squad series for fans of crime novels and police dramas. This series is one of my favorites in the genre.

"
"Tana French is a master of suspense. She weaves tension into every sentence, every word.

We start knowing Aislinn is dead. We don't know how she died.

At every turn, it seems possible that everything to do with this case will go wrong. And, it does. We get a sense that there is a deeper more difficult story, but it is revealed only in glances and suggestions.

The lead detective, Antoinette, is angry and paranoid (not without reason). French builds up that paranoia building block after building block until I was there, too. It was impossible to know what was real and what was imagined, what was there and was not there, what was fact and what was obfuscation.

I love the way French captures all of the layers: the suspense, the paranoia, the language, the interactions, a female detective navigating a male world, allies and enemies.

"
"Loved Tana French's first book for its beyond beautiful writing, ho-hummed my way through the rest hoping she'd get some of that back - and The Trespasser rewarded my patience. Not that the writing is gorgeous but it is strong and the main part of the story (to me) is even stronger.

But first let's get a few quibbles out of the way, as this book has some flaws that would torpedo many mysteries. The worst is that the whodunit and whydunit ring false and the justification for them is clumsy and unconvincing. Really, Tana, you couldn't do better after all these mysteries?

That aside, the mystery is just a small part of The Trespasser. This story is really about how we perceive people and how that affects us - and whether we let that affect us. Brilliant topic to explore and Tana does it brilliantly."
"Not my favorite Tana French novel (and yes, I've read them all), but I still really liked it. I think part of the reason it's not my favorite is that I figured out who the murderer was before the detectives did. But it did live up to the other Tana French novels in that it took you into the thought processes of the lead detective. You saw things through her eyes and with her filters. I really like how the book illustrates the effects of bullying and prejudice. Battling back against a bully in the workplace skewed the lead detective's entire view of both her workplace and the crime she was investigating. It shows that over time bullying can even affect someone's self worth. That was probably the biggest crime in the book. Tana French's novels never fail to satisfy on the the psychology of detectives. "
"The latest in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series. The series is made up of linked novels featuring mostly different detectives in each book. The last two books had the same detectives, but were from different points of view.

Anyway, I love this series. In The Trespasser, Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner are investigating what seems to be a straightforward domestic murder, but things don't quite seem to add up. Or is that wishful thinking on their part?

I really liked this. I am number 31 on the hold list for a hard copy, so I was stuck with the electronic audiobook. This is not normally a problem unless the book is hard to put down like this one, and it's just not easy to find 16 hours to listen to a book. I found myself trying to listen to it all the time, even while watching the World Series! Highly recommended. My favorite of the series so far."
"I love the structure French has created. the Dublin Murder Squad is a box of Easter eggs, each novel builds an intricate story around one detective. The reader learns about the character while the mystery is solved. Her technique avoids the staleness of a main character after several books in a series when we know everything about them and most of their relatives have been imperiled if not murdered. So refreshing. With the Squad giving familiarity with procedure you enjoy the mystery and the new main character. This book is unusual in that the two detectives were also featured in her previous novel, but from the viewpoint of the other partner. The mystery is traditional locked room and the solution satisfying. Looking forward to the next which focuses on the gaffer, the only character who appears in each of her novels."
"I normally love Tana French's books and can't get enough of them, which is fantastic that they are so long. This one I struggled with initially, for what I partake as my own personal reasons. The main character in this book, Conway, was so paranoid and lacking in self-confidence during the first half of the book that it distracted from the story for me (as I was dealing with someone in my personal life with similar issues at the same time). And I tend not to like books with weak characters in general (Girl on the Train drove me nuts). When Conway got past that and could really concentrate on the case at hand I couldn't stop listening (I learned after the first couple of this series to get the audio books and drink in the lovely Irish accents). Can't wait for the next installment, as I said any issues I had with this book were my own. "
"I made a beeline to B&N as soon as this became available and I was not disappointed. Another great murder mystery of the Dublin Murder Squad series. Like many of her books, there is not a lot of physical action - the action lies within the dialogue, witness interviews and conversations among the detectives and subtle changes that occur with a single word or two. The lead detective, Antoinette (secondary character in the previous novel, The Secret Place), has been handed a seemingly easy domestic violence case. With her partner, Detective Stephen Moran, they work together against hostile peers, managers and the press to investigate the murder of a young woman. Antoinette is a hard person to like; she's tough and abrasive and her frequent crude language is off-putting (and tiresome, after a while) but she grew on me. Dark, twisty and surprising. "
""". . .I sit there, running the heat to try and thaw my feet after Lucy's flat, and watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe,and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.""

Murder D Antoinette Conway's mind has fixed on a story for which she continually finds proof, and as she struggles to solve a murder she is hampered yet strengthened by her misconceptions.

This nuanced novel is stunningly written and filled with enough plot twists and vivid character development to satisfy every reader.
"
"Another ""can't see it coming"" thriller!

I don't remember how I discovered Tana French but now I eagerly await new releases and she never disappoints! Yes things wrap up tidily in the end but during the journey you not only go through the emotions as you get to know the characters, but even the main character you cannot just take at her thoughts - the flaws that make her human become apparent which makes her so much more accessible than some super detective. There is no first half and second half of the plot, she keeps it shifting throughout the story so you only think you know what's coming. I'm only sorry now to be finished and having to wait for her next novel. I won't complain though because she doesn't just churn stuff out - there's quality in every installation, making it worth the wait."
"I have read all of Tana's Dublin Murder Squad books, and I have to say, sometimes she really makes you work for it. This was one of those times. She has a wonderful grasp of this genre, and her characters are always interesting, intelligent, and perfectly flawed. I wasn't sure where the story was going, but once I started picking up what she was putting down, the last 100 pages clipped along and it was massively rewarding. Her themes are very relevant. She even threw down an unflattering Donald Trump reference. Go Tana!"
"A murder mystery. Takes you through the mental struggles of two detectives with a murder that at first appears to be a no brainer. They want and need a good case for their careers but are they forcing this one ? A little long, interesting start then almost turned it in 3/4 way through but then got interested again and decided to see it through. Loved the dialect, interesting although sometimes difficult to understand. "
"This is the first Tana French book I have listened to. I enjoyed it. I did have to focus as I listened. I enjoyed the narrator's accent as well as the language (different words) used in Ireland. I read some reviews, and I would agree that parts of it were ponderous but I found those parts interesting."
"Only two things I didn't like about this book, too much self absorption of I'm the only woman in the squad room and therefore all attacks are directed at me, and the lack of an English dictionary describing particular Irish slang. Huh, eg., what's a gaffer, (I know now)? That's just one of many many such words. Other than that I absolutely enjoyed this read. A good entertaining mystery."
"I have read all of Tana French's books to date and they never cease to disappoint me. What I love about her books is the fact that they're not just ""whodunit"" types of mysteries where a crime is committed and in the end super smart sleuth figures out who the perpetrator is and brings him/her to justice. You can actually see the characters and story-lines evolve as you read through each book. The ""bad guys"" aren't always inherently evil wrongdoers and the detectives aren't always perfect examples of protectors of society. Each character is simply portrayed as being human and not all stories have a ""happy ending"". The Trespasser is yet another great example of Tana French's ability to create a well thought out plot and set of characters. It definitely hooked me from the first page through the last."
"I started it Friday evening, it’s Sunday afternoon. I’m a slow reader. (Irony alert, for those of you nodding off). The level of detail is mind boggling. The people, the places, everything seems so real. The bar tender that id’s the killer, the victim’s girlfriend, the boss, the mid-level characters, the mains. “Witch Elm” was my favorite last year, and this is the early front runner, at least until I read another of hers. I understand why the regulars had problems with “Witch Elm.” If you were used to the Dublin Murder Squad procedurals the “Witch Elm” literariness would throw you. You might like both chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies, but if you buy chocolate chip and they taste like peanut butter, you’re gonna say, “Hey, wait a minute...”. Anyway, loved this one. Astonishing talent, beautiful work. I’m smitten."
"As always, you can expect to pick up a novel by Tana French and get, at the very least, strong writing and a clear narrative. The Trespasser is a bit different from the previous installments in that it isn't told after the fact, with allusions by the narrator to critical moments seen in hindsight, but rather as a present-day event, being lived out in full chaos, which already piqued my interest. It added to the absolute paranoia and suspicion experienced by the narrator, Antoinette Conway, featured in The Secret Place, as her squad continuously pranks and harasses her.

I was a bit letdown by the actual case, as it was a touch on the boring side until French ramps up the conspiracy factor. And as much as I loved Conway in The Secret Place, here we see her weaknesses and unapologetic meanness, and it's a little like seeing a person you admire in holey panties."
"I love how Tana French writes, almost poetic which is unusual for this genre. You feel really emotionally connected to the characters who are written beautifully. This book was about abandonment, love, loyalty and lots of other things. The plot was interesting, the pace was tense and it all came together in the end. Plot for my memory- Antoinette is a cop on the murder squad who is being bullied by the men simultaneously hating them but wanting desperately to be a part of it. A woman is murdered and she immediately hates the victim. Turns out the victim was seducing another cop so that she could ruin his life, he was involved when her father disappeared and she learned he had lied about it at the time. The cop killed her and another cop covered it up. Antoinette was also abandoned by her father so it brings up a lot of old insecurities "
"AUDIO BOOK: Didn’t realize it was part of a series when I started listening. It was good, lots of detail. The story is told in a very understandable way."
"Every one of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad novels stands out on its own. Unlike other series, this one turns the lens onto different members of the squad and looks at the seedy underbelly of Dublin through different eyes each time. This time it's Antoinette Conway's turn. She's not very likeable. She's snarky and mouthy and a bit of a whiner, thinking everyone else is out to get her. Sometimes this becomes a bit monotonous, but the plotline, tracking the murder of a young woman in her flat, carries the story along. This is a great novel for mystery lovers who like books without cookie cutter characters. Antoinette and her partner Stephen Moran are thoughtful and complicated. I would love to meet them in person. "
"Tana French can get me every time! I never think I am going to enjoy reading about a ""new"" detective, but somehow she always gets to me. This book focuses on Antoinette and Stephen, the self-described outcasts of the murder squad. I loved the two of them working together--each of them understanding the other so well.

This book centers around the murder of a young woman who was just beginning to find her way in life. The case seems cut and dried at first, but the two detectives want to dig deeper, and they certainly find out more than they were expecting. I was drawn in as always and LOVE Tana French's writing!

Thanks to NetGalley for an ARC of this book in return for an honest review."
"I've read a few of the Dublin murder squads books, but don't really remember any of the characters, or if I'm honest the stories, above enjoying them enough to read another.This book might change that,I'm more likely to remember a book that had me frustrated at every turn, not knowing who the murderer was.Everytime I was sure, along came another scenario, or another piece of evidence, and my main suspect was out again.Can't say I warmed to the main characters, but the interplay between the whole squad added a nice tense atmosphere to the book, and I liked the idea that either everyone was out to get Antoinette... or she was paranoid.A great ending, that had cops showing loyalty, but not begin the rules.... might need to hunt down the previous book now."
"It's always long enough between books that I forget all the connections between the characters and where they showed up before, and I like it that way. It gives the characters room to be who they are for the time of the book. The atmosphere in this book is heavy and paranoid and doesn't let up. French lets several possibilities of what really happened and what is really going on hover around, at least for me, I entertained most of them without becoming invested in any one (apart from becoming invested in hoping that Conway eventually gets to a better mental state). So even though the end is a series of very long interrogation scenes, I wanted to keep reading. And now that I'm caught up with French's output, it is time to re-read and wait however long it takes for the next one."
"Tana French is an author we look forward to in my house. New book! Excitement! Order it quick, fight over who reads it first!
This time I got to it first. Started out enjoying it, then I started to get antsy, where was it going, it didn't have that extra bit of creep factor I remember from some of the others, or at least not enough. But I like her stuff so I was patient, kept going and got intrigued. Once finished, I put it down and the whole tale suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. Wow.
And I can't talk about it because I can't spoil it.
This one is far more psychological than most. You second guess yourself just as much as Antoinette Conway does. It's a bit of a heartbreaker, that's all I'll say. If you like Tana French be sure to read it."
"
I mean, these books sort of feel like belonging to some sort of low-level cult at this point, even the ones in these series that I don't love as much of the others, I still find compulsively readable and engaging.

However, if for some reason you were worried about this one not living up to previous expectations, don't be. This thing is fan-freaking tastic, and I'm now just sad I can't read it for the first time again. After the last book, this one returns to a first-person narration throughout and while I liked Secret Place, I really like the return to the first person, where it as much about how Conway sees herself as it is about the actual facts of the case. Now the long wait for the next one, there is going to be a next one, right?"
"4.5 stars

I know who to turn to the next time I want a really immersive psychological thriller with a badass protagonist. Such a deep and thorough introspection of the protagonist. She's sharp, quick-witted, highly self-conscious and just about pissed off with everyone and everything (could perhaps benefit from anger-management classes lol). Tana French takes her sweet time with the plot, building a solid connection between readers and the protagonist with elaborate procedural and everything falls neatly at the end. No loose ends. Who knew interrogations or interviews can be as intense as this? The dynamic toxic relationship within the Murder Squad is well-crafted. Overall, a satisfying read."
"This one starts off a bit slow, comparatively. A lot of pieces to line up, but stick with it. Once everything lines up and ignites, you won't want to put it down, and you won't truly have all the pieces until quite near the end despite pretty good visibility throughout. This story does a good job of cutting a fine path through a delicate and relevant scenario for today's world. My only negative is that too many of the characters were just a little too good, and just a little too capable. This left some of the early scenes not quite believable and no single character to point at and say 'you, you get all of my rage in this book.""
My speculation for what's next? I think we're going to dive back into the seedy underbelly of the undercover world, and I'm already itching to read that next one."
"Tana French's books are deep studies of human nature. In this one, everyone spends too much time inside their own heads, making up stories and seeing the world accordingly. Antoinette Conway, the detective and the only woman on the squad, has experienced a number of degrading insults from the men she works with. The victim's father disappeared when she was a child which naturally affected her deeply, and she has let her very active imagination run her life. She meets a young man of the same type and the romance appears to be serious when she is murdered. Antoinette and her partner develop several outlandish theories before discovering the identity of the murderer is even more unexpected. "
"This is my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book since In the Woods and The Likeness. With Faithful Place and Broken Harbor, one half of the equation was off for me - either I loved the mystery and hated the cop's story, or vice versa. The Secret Place missed out because of the arduous perspective switching and the miscalculated effort to write about teenage girls. I liked all three of them, but there was just part of the equation that didn't add up for me. The Trespasser got that back, and I loved every bit of it. Not to mention that 
it was the happiest ending I've ever seen from a Tana French book. I haven't wanted to hear more from one of the protagonists since Rob and Cassie. Antoinette and Stephen are kind of, sort of what I'd hoped Rob and Cassie could be."
"An excellent mystery from Tana French. A big improvement, in my opinion, on the previous one. This time we have a female detective in the Dublin Murder Squad (the only female) who feels she is being targeted by the other detectives for mean-spirited pranks and worse. (or is she just paranoid?) Then she and her partner are given a murder to solve. it appears to be a simple ""domestic"", of the sort they have solved several times before. But if so, why is one of the top detectives so interested? what is the ulterior motive? more paranoia ensues. It's well written. And easy to read. Not a lot happens, but up till the end, you are not clear who the killer will be. And is Antoinette's partner on her side, or on the side of the men? read on and enjoy...."
"A slow build-up of a book that despite its length kept me hooked. And totally worth it for the brilliant last scene, in which the (well-drawn and complex) protagonist's own fallibility becomes completely apparent -- to herself and to us -- in the space of a two-line revelation/diagnosis. So this very detailed police procedural ends up being a really compelling study of how we get caught up in the stories we tell ourselves, and how wisdom might consist of knowing that the way to get things done is not to debunk those stories but to take them seriously and to offer others the ability to act in accordance with their own commitments.

This one requires patience, but the ending really has depth, more so than even the best of French's very good body of work."
"Torn between 3.5 and 4 stars. Like all of Tana French's books, I loved the story and was still guessing for a good part of the book. I didn't even mind that a lot of it took place in the squad room, like others did. I found the brainstorming interesting. This is the only one, though, where I didn't love the main character. I get what she was doing with her - woman in a ""man's world"" who had to become hardened to it, but it seemed a little like being bashed over the head with it over and over throughout the book. The ""everyone picks on me but I don't care - no really, see how much I don't care?"" thing was getting in the way quite a bit for me - I started to really dislike her, in fact - but in the end, Tana French does weave the best mysteries."
"The investigation into the death of Aislinn Murphy initially appears to be a domestic but the more Conway and Moran investigate the more complex it becomes. Add to that harrassment by her colleagues as well as Breslin and McCann who, on the surface look like they are helping but dig deeper and it appears they have an agenda of their own, why?

A good suspenseful novel that had a few twists and turns. The 6th in a series but the first I have read and after having read it felt that I had lost nothing in not having read the other books first. It did make me want to read the others though.

A well written, complex story of murder and cover up. Well worth a read and one I would recommend."
"I had started this library loaned book, then received five other books from the library, two of which I had really wanted to read quickly, so turned it back into the library and got it back again a week ago. Then I couldn't put it down. I have enjoyed reading the previous books of this series and like the characters a lot. I hope that BBC TV will make a series of these books because they'd be ""grand"" (as the characters say). I actually figured out early on who dunnit but there were still surprises that unfolded up to the end. You can pick this up and read it without having read the previous ones, it stands alone well as a very good story. I will admit it takes a bit for this American tongue to get the roll of the Irish colloquialisms but, if I can, so can you."
"Ok not as good as Faithful Place which is my favorite of hers, but MUCH better than the last two. She returns to a female protag for the first time since The Likeness and to a male/female pair of detectives for the first time since In the Woods, so I was a bit worried that this book would fuck me up, but it didn't. I love how the case often echoes something that's going on in the detectives' lives and this was no exception. I was happy that there was a ""happy"" ending, but intrigued to see where she can take the series from here. I also loved Antoinette's throwaway mention of a different woman detective - the elusive Cassie! I will never finish wondering what's happening to her and what Rob Ryan is up to. "
"I typically shy away from series because I get burned out. I started the fourth Game of Thrones novel like two years ago and I can't get through more than a couple pages before I give up again. The Trespasser has been on my radar for awhile and sounded like an interesting read. Given my series commitment issues, I was reluctant at first, but I read some reviews that said you could read them as stand alone novels, so I thought I'd take a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this story. It was a pretty standard mystery and there wasn't anything really shocking about it, but I thought the characters were well written as were the interrogation scenes. I purchased In the Woods and then I'll see if I want to continue the series."
"The Likeness is infamous for an unbelievable premise. I don't see other readers bothered by this - but to buy into this one you have to believe that anyone can just lose 20 lbs and be the girl that every guy wants. I just wasn't able to buy into it fully and it bothered me all the way through. I also found the motives for a lot of characters actions unbelievably extreme and difficult to fathom. Otherwise, it was beautifully written and a masterpiece of psychological drama, so I did ultimately enjoy it when those other things weren't tugging at my consciousness."
"This mystery follows Antionette Conway and Stephen Moran, newly partnered dectectives in the Murder Squad in Dublin. Antionette has not had an easy time integrating into an all male squad and fears that if she doesn't clear the latest case she's been handed that she's going to be out. What appears on the surface to be an easy case to solve - a young woman killed in a lover's tiff, all signs pointing to the new beau, take Antionette and Stephen down a whole series of rabbit holes. I know I'm in the minority here, but although I appreciate all the twists and turns, I feel like her books take just a bit too long to wrap up..I start to get antsy...like, get to the point already. Still an enjoyable read and anyone who has read her prior books will appreciate this one as well."
"The lingering suspense and rhythm of this novel caused me to race through it. French was able to create a strong narrative and engaging story that was almost completely through detective interviews and inner dialogue. I really, really enjoyed Antoinette's character. Her take-no-prisoner, fierce, unforgiving personality was fun to read.
I actually didn't realize that Detectives Conway and Moran were featured in one of French's previous novels; this does work well as a stand-alone.
The reason this didn't get the full five stars from me was the wrap up of the plot didn't leave me surprised/exhilarated. I kept waiting for the build-up to start ramping up the intensity, but...it never happened. It was still a satisfying and suspenseful read, just not quite what I hoped for.
"
Slow to start but a great finish. 
She never disappoints. Definitely one of my favorite authors. 
"The latest addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series with the return of Antoinette Conway still battling the prejudice of the murder room veterans .
Teamed with Stephen Moran, they catch a case that appears to be a domestic gone wrong. But things are not adding up on several different parts of this case, especially the detective who wants to move things faster than Moran and Conway feel is necessary. As usual with this series the characters are so very well drawn, good guys and bad. This police procedural moves slowly and painstakingly to the ending. An excellent read. Can stand alone for anyone who has missed the Secret Place."
"Antoinette Conway is as tough as they come, but the endless hazing (less name-calling and off-color jokes than active sabotage and body fluids) that comes with being the only female detective on the Murder Squad has worn her down. She and her relentlessly amiable partner Steve Moran get stuck with an open-and-shut domestic case, then saddled with the more experienced Detective Breslin. The thing is, the more Conway pokes into Aislinn Murray's shallow life and pointless death, the less straightforward they seem. And the harder Breslin pushes her to arrest Aislinn's boyfriend, the less she trusts any of her squad. Another dark and twisted mind-bender from French."
"Trespasser touched upon the themes of relationships, careerism, and trust. The novel provides a perspective of superficiality on the nature of relationships and fragility of careers. While the cynicism provides an interesting perspective, I would have liked a deeper development in the roots of loyalty.

I thought it was interesting to consider the perspective of characters rooting within their personal narrative. Still, I wondered at times if it might have been more interesting to add a greater degree of free will into the narration. Still, there was some good development of characters personalities."
"I love Tana French. I think she is a superb writer and that her stories are compelling, dark, and un-put-downable.

I liked this book, but it's not my favorite. I wouldn't have anybody new to Tana start with this one. It picked up a lot in the end, but it almost took too long to get there. I know she is the best at the suspense, but usually there is more character build up or emotional connection, and you often get to hear from more than character. This time it was almost straight procedural until 3/4 the way through, which made it easier to put down.

She's still great and I still loved the book, just not one of my top favorites from her."
"Not her best but very good

Al of Tana French's books take a while to get into. She sets up so much - like a low burn before it starts to come blazing. This one was no different. She kept me guessing for a while - but the thing about this one - is that the plot was thinner than any other book she's written. Even though I think she tried, I didn't care about these characters much. The other detectives in the other books I care about. This one was more about the plot and the story than the characters and as I said, the plot was only somewhat believable. Still a good read, but her others are better."
"I love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad novels. She's got such a great ear for dialogue, so when she shifts protagonists from one novel to the next, you really feel the distinct personality at the center. This one, with a tough and bullied mixed-race woman at the center, captures so perfectly how impossible it is to be female in certain male-dominated work environments; and the mystery at the center unfolds with the kinds of surprises you can expect from her previous novels. It's not my favorite of hers -- I can't forget Faithful Place -- but it's terrific and, as usual, I'm only sorry that I won't get inside the head of Antoinette Conway again in future novels."
"Tana French novels remain some of my favorite detective/mystery novels out there. I love how the MC of each novel is different, but connected to the last book (admittedly, I had read the last book so long ago I didn't remember anything about it...). This one certainly did not disappoint in its twists and turns, character development, plot development, etc. I didn't LOVE the through-line that the squad hated Antoinette (I think it was an important plot point, I'm just not sure it was executed well). Besides that, certainly an enjoyable read. It doesn't stack up to The Likeness, which is by far still by favorite Tana French novel (and one of my favorite novels in general) but worth the read!"
"Even though I'm a fan of French, I found this book puzzling. It seemed-and was-quite long but I couldn't see how it could be shortened. French was taking a methodical approach so every sentence was necessary. That's not the mystery way but I think French was determined to show actual police work. The book wasn't boring but I'd shoot myself if I ended up as a detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. Tracking down every lead--no matter how small--would make me crazy. The lead detective is young and flawed-an interesting study. No doubt this book took a long time to write. I'm prepared to be patient as I wait for her next one.




"
"discovering Tayna French last year was one of my best literary surprises in my recent memory. She manages to elevate; what could be, standard police procedural mysteries to a level of hauntingly beautiful fiction.
That being said, this wasn't my favourite of the Dublin Murder Squad series. My enjoyment of the novel relied more heavily on the strength of Frenches writing and less on the actual plot. I found the book to be a bit slow during the middle section, which felt a bit too much like a detailed character study. Regardless, I would not heftiest to recommend this book to anyone - although not perhaps as the introductory novel in this series."
"Story was interesting w several twists. Loved the interaction between the detectives. No doubt women take a lot of abuse in the man's world of law enforcement. Det Antoinette Conway is assigned a murder case that has all the appearances of a love affair gone bad. Aislinn Murray is found dead in her living room & her new boyfriend is the prime suspect. However, Conway insists on exploring all possibilities before they make an arrest. She & her partner uncover some ugly truths about their own colleagues in the process. My main criticism is that the book dragged out the investigation. I love long books but not at the expense of repetition or tedium. "
"Tana French is very skillful at building up characters who are complex and believable, as well as creating moods and scenes that spark with emotion and intensity.

I just looked up the previous books and discovered that the two main murder detectives in this book are the same as the previous one, and I wish it hadn't been so long since I read it because I'm sure I missed out on a few connections; the previous one was my least favorite however, so I'm not surprised I didn't clock on. But one thing that I like about this series is that you don't need to read them all to appreciate them individually."
"I'll have to think about this, but having just finished it, I feel a bit let down. There were times when the story seemed like it was heading for tragedy and despair, and I'm glad it ended up without anyone devastated or dead, but....
Having slept on it, I'm speculating this is something of a transition book in a bigger overall story. One theme is the importance of friendship--in The Secret Place, Stephen thinks Conway has lost faith in him but she hasn't, and the reverse happens in this book. We get their love for their job from both of their perspectives. I can't imagine what the next book will be, but there seems to be room for more of their story."
"I eagerly await each new Tana French novel and this one didn't let me down. I loved it. It didn't wrench me emotionally the way In The Woods and The Likeness did, but French proved again here that she's an expert at drawing characters who are not honest with themselves, and creating moving platonic relationships between men and women. She also, of course, keeps you guessing. She's done readers a real service by creating Antoinette Conway, a brilliant, tough, but often too-tough detective who's navigating a man's world as a non-white woman. I hope Antoinette makes more appearances in the universe French has created in her novels."
"Once again I've read a series book out of order and this was my first introduction to Detective Conway and the gang.
After a very slow start, this book has been fantastic..
In the beginning I felt it got a little too bogged down into the antagonistic personality of Conway...and it certainly took a little while for the plot to form, but the snappy, witty and irritable banter between Conway and her sidekick soon became familiar and enjoyable...and then the story became very interesting as well. Even though everything didn't quite come together for me until well after I was halfway through the book, I'm really glad I stuck with it, as the outcome was mind blowing and very worth the wait.
"
"Gritty detective novel asking who dunnit? Aislinn Murray is discovered dead in her place. The police are tipped off by an untraceable call. Assigned to the case are detectives Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran. Conway is the protagonist and is a coarse, abrasive individual who is shunned by most of the others in her squad. Also assisting in the investigation is Breslin a smooth, somewhat arrogant detective. The prime suspect is Aislinn's boyfriend, who strikes me as a Roddy McDowell personality-reserved but given to fantasy. Conway and Moran explore a number of dead ends but eventually unlock the mystery-or do they?



"
"I love the way Tana French gets into the head of her detectives so much that I get frustrated by the way each novel follows a different detective. I suppose I get so used to the ""series"" model of mysteries that I expect it, even as I recognize the flaws--eventually it becomes so formulaic and dull. The biggest pitfall with series that focus on the same central character is that the character either has to be perfect to start with, and therefore dull, or any personal growth that they experience in one book is suddenly gone when the next starts so the formula can repeat. French can allow her characters to evolve without worrying about the next book, which is refreshing. "
"The tension never lessens in this latest Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran joint attempt to winkle out the good guys from the bad guys, some of whom may be members of the Dublin Murder Squad itself. Antoinette is at her most driven, apt word, as, at one point she she drives away Stephen himself, thankfully only temporarily. They have to contend with Detective Breslin, is he helping or dogging their steps to keep aware of their findings? The Gaffer, Superintendent, or whatever the Irish call the top cop, is enigmatic. Antoinette does not let anyone prevent her from getting at the truth, which, after many twists and turns, ""will out."""
A good mystery with some nice plot twists
"Every time I finish a Tana French book I want to go back and reread all of the previous ones in the series. I really liked this & liked seeing Moran back investigating the crime. Antoinette I was less a fan of, I found her frustrating for a large part of the book and just wanted her to try & look at the case without the massive chip on her shoulder. Having said that I was really happy with her growth through the book and the ending for her character was very satisfying.

I am not usually a fan on crime novels but this series is the exception- I can't wait to see who is next in line to be a narrator!"
"So glad to be able to follow Moran and Conway but from Conway's point of view this time. Trespassers kept me engaged in the psychological parlay between the detectives on the case. One review I read mentioned Conway might not be French's best conduit for telling the murder squad story. I wholly disagree. French paints Conway bracingly, not afraid to confront through Conway the sexism and hazing women endure in many quarters even today. Conway is a strong, thoughtful woman pushed to her limit but takes the high road. I applauded Conway's way of facing, head on, her own tresspasser. Totally in character. Conway is a heroine for the 21st century. "
"Tana French is a favorite author among my family members, and we were quite excited that she had a new book. So far, three of us have read it, and we were not disappointed! This is a great novel from a great mystery/crime writer. Although none of the developments were totally shocking, there were surprises enough and plenty of energy. Conway and Moran are very likable characters, especially Moran. I'll miss him until the next book comes out.

This is my ranking of French's books, so far:
1. In the Woods
2. Faithful Place
3. The Trespasser (tie)
3. The Likeness (tie)
5. Secret Place
6. Broken Harbor (the only one I didn't like)"
"Tana French does something brave with her celebrity in The Trespasser - she introduces us to a new, rough, unlikable, huge chip-on-her-shoulder protagonist. Yes, we sympathize with the sexist bullying she faces, but there is nothing at all to warm to.

I usually put down books that require me to spend hours with an unlikable protagonist - I'm still kind of grumpy with Ian McEwan for Solar. But in this case, French's mastery kept me turning the pages, and eventually, I came to understand the brittle defensiveness that drives Antoinette, and to cheer her awakening.

Final analysis: entertaining and engaging, an enlightening glimpse into a world I wouldn't otherwise be able to go."
"I really enjoyed this book and I think Tana French is a boss, but I wish it had a bit quicker pacing and maybe a few less interview scenes. I realize this is the business of being a cop and is probably in many ways how police investigations actually go, but I got frustrated with the need to reveal every detail through scenes of questioning. Things I liked about it a lot and wanted to know more about: Conway and her history and her mom, who seems awesome; other cases she'd worked with Moran; why on earth Aislinn was so into Rory. Things I could have heard less about: Breslin. Breslin can suck it."
"Another good solid book from Tana French. We get to know the 2 detectives much better this time around. A good solid plot, however I did feel there were a lot of ifs, buts and maybes in the final wrapping up scenes and this did allow the story to lose some pace towards the end. Just too many possible permutations allowed into the narrative. However it did conclude tidily and the reader was left satisfied with a neat finish. "
"I would read Tana French's version of the Dublin phonebook, given a chance. She is a master at getting under the skin of her characters and describing their motivations with a surgeon's precision."
"I've re-read this and I'm surprised I only gave it 3 stars - I've bumped it up. I find Tana French irresistible and even her most ridiculously implausible book, The Likeness, works for me because of the writing style and the characterisation. This book, unlike that one, has it all - tight plot, an empathetic protagonist (if not exactly likeable), satisfying ending, the same smart, literary style that remains true to how people would realistically speak and act. Antoinette's entire personality is carefully constructed; how she works, her relationship with her mother; what she hates and who; who earns her respect- it all serves our understanding of this complex character."
"Tana French has written a fast paced, well plotted, 250 page police procedural. Unfortunately, it took her 450 pages to do it. I enjoyed the book but found myself skipping 5, 10, even 20 pages of repetitious dialogue and interminable suspect/witness interviews. Seems like publishers think they can't sell mass market books that aren't the size of a brick. Some authors can fill that size demand, some just add tons of filler. French is a good writer who should be allowed to base the length of her books on the material, not a proscribed number of pages. Whatever happened to the paperback book you could stick in your pocket?"
"Well I reached my book goal for the year and I finished the Dublin Murder Squad books all in one go. This wasn’t my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books but I still loved it. And thankfully Tana French has a book coming out in October so I’ll give that a go. What about everyone else? What’s your favorite Tana French? I think mine was probably #2 (The Likeness) or #5 (The Secret Place). Although #4 (Broken Harbor) was nuts because of the particular murder and I liked #3 (Faithful Place) because it had that different tone... I like them all obviously.

"Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran of the Dublin Murder Squad investigate the murder of Barbie-like Aislinn Murray, apparently at the hands of her new beau. Like Conway's dream job on the Murder Squad, where she encounters more obstacles than support, the case proves not to be the slam-dunk it originally appears. Conway, while tough, introspects at length on the case as well as on her position, and the results are unexpected.
(Note: I received pre-publication to this title through Edelweiss.)
"
"I've read all the Tana French novels. This one was a bit harder for me to get into. But it was worth sticking with. I was having a lot of trouble with Conway's practically bipolar back and forth, thinking everyone was out to get her. I do wonder if the real murder detectives in Dublin mind how they are depicted in the books. I'm sure it is very hard to be a woman in that job. But if the discrimination was that bad It shouldn't be allowed!I like the Conway character, I'd like to see her return, but with perhaps a smaller chip on her shoulder. "
"Please note: I read this as a free e-ARC from Netgalley. This installment of the Dublin Murder Squad focuses on Antoinette Conway. She's the only female detective in the squad and plays that up with much vigilance or is it paranoia. Either way, that is one part that tended to get old. Otherwise, a substantial police procedural as Conway and her partner search for the killer of a young woman. The turns and twists as they look at the most likely killer (her boyfriend) or other possibilities that could end their careers. "
"French just keeps getting better & better. Antoinette Conway is trying to make it as a detective in Dublin's murder squad, despite the rampant sexism & harassment. She & Steve Moran catch a murder case involving a young woman found dead in her flat after an anonymous call to police tipping them off to her death. As it becomes more evident that this murder is not as simple as it seems, Conway risks her very career to solve the crime. As always in French's books, Dublin is a character just as much as the people depicted."
"For a minute there I thought Tana French had finally hit a wall with The Trespasser. My loyalty made me continue. The good news is that she's still a genius. The bad news is that Penguin let me read this book early, so I will be forced to wait another year for the next book. I am not going to spoil anything, but I will say that every bit of pacing in this book is done for good reasons. Finish the book. Only Tana French could make me want to work in the Dublin Murder Squad while also making me exhausted by the possibilities."
"I was truly excited to embark on another Dublin Murder Squad book, I love that the central characters have some relationship with previous books in the series but they are not a series in the traditional or expected way. Tana French is good at her craft and her books get down into the nitty gritty of life and death. I enjoy the depth of her characters, they are multi-layered and complex.

The Trespasser successfully delves into the complexities of abandonment, hate, paranoia, trust, friendship, manipulation, and betrayal. Another must read by Tana French."
"I first gave it three stars because there is no 3.5, but as I began reviewing it, I started liking it better. Though it was slower at times than most of what Tana French has written, I think the tone is representative of the different sort of case the squad is dealing with here. I also wish I hadn't been able to solve the case quite so soon myself (1/3 of the way in), but in light of the way things played out, that may have been an intentional, though unconventional, technique by French, making this less a mystery than a character study. "
"The narration of this audiobook is one of the best I've experienced. I can't properly evaluate the nuances of Irish accents, but to this American's ears, it was a pure delight listening to Hilda Fay capture the essence of these characters.
The narration is a work of art. The writing is inspired. The story runs thin and predictable in places, but there is so much artistry throughout that it's forgivable.
I read so much I don't have time to mourn the end of books. Three books deep and I'm still missing the characters on this one."
"This one was intense from page one and I confess there were paragraphs where I had a hard time following all the mind games and interrogations. Whenever I read a novel, I like to ponder what message or thoughts the author incorporates into the story for the reader to consider. There are many themes to consider in this story, what I plan to think about the most for awhile is Control. Getting control, giving control, having control, being in control, taking control, and losing control of ourselves and others. ""Well played"" Tana French, well played."
"I liked this story a lot, but I didn't think it was quite as good as some of the previous books by Tana French. I like Antoinette and enjoyed hearing her inner thoughts as the story unfolded, but there was just something about this one that didn't grip me quite the same way the other books did. It may have been as simple as the fact I didn't read it in one or two sittings; rather I kept putting it down, which would never have happened with the previous entries.

Can't miss author for me to be sure."
"Another really good entry in this series. This one unfolded a bit slowly, partially due to the fact that most of the action is recounted and not experienced firsthand, but that also contributed to the overall themes at play. I love how French focuses on the psychological elements of the mystery without ever compromising the suspense; it's hard to write a thriller that is character - rather than plot - driven, and she excels at it.

I am beyond curious to see who the next book focuses on - maybe the Superintendent??"
"I believe this may be the best of the ""Dublin Murder Squad"" books yet. The pacing and the story are excellent, but I feel that the dialogue makes this book. Some may find the use of Irish colloquialisms off-putting, but they are what draw me into the story even more, and for those who don't care to look up them up, the truth is that they are not at all important to the actual story. If I had any complaint, it is simply that Ms. French takes two years between books, but when the story is this this good, and the book this well written, two years is really a very short time."
"Tana French is brilliant. Her characters are so true - they leap off the page, so as a reader, you are so vested in them! Then she adds these wonderful mysteries which twist and turn and leap, so that you are even questioning your own thinking. THEN she adds the subtle nuance of deeper meaning - what role do your parents play? How do you become independent? When does self-reliance turn into destructive isolation? Who do we trust and why? How can we let an obsession derail a life? Fascinating. Please tell me the next one is out... please."
"It took me a long time to finish this book. The first half of the book was slow going. The characters were very well developed, along with the setting and the Dublin dialect. But the excessive details, and the unhappy tone of the main character both made it feel a little too long. For the final third or so of the book, it was still slow going, but only because the intensity of the story and the writing had me needing a little break every few pages. That is not typical of my reading style, and I can't put my finger on the exact reasons. Definitely a thriller."
"Another enjoyable read from Tana French. She really is an outstanding writer. Place, character, suspense -- she's got it all. This one is another police procedural featuring the Dublin murder squad, especially Antoinette and Steve, the youngest D's. The interview scenes are masterful. Suspense continues till the last few pages. Some neat twists and turns. I still like her first 2 books the best but do recommend this one as well. For aspiring writers, you could pick about any paragraph and find a great example of ""showing not telling."" Just saying."
"For fans of Tana French, this Dublin police procedural has all the elements we've come to expect: the complexity of plot and character - as well as the complexity of morality - the twists that surprise and an ending that satisfies. What appears to be a slam-dunk murder-by-boyfriend will require much more persistence and depth of investigation to truly solve. An investigation that will change several members of the Murder Division of the department. As usual, French delivers more bang for your reading buck."
"Another page-turner from the reliably excellent Tana French

Anyone who read Ms. French's first two novels and skipped the rest won't be as seduced by this book as they were by In The Woods and The Likeness. However, like the rest of her novels, this is a great character study, an intimate view into the life of a Murder D, and a brilliantly crafted mystery. I do wish she'd produce another like the first two, which read like mysteries written by Donna Tartt - but still, her novels never disappoint."
"4.5 stars. This was a totally enjoyable read-probably my second favorite Tana French novel. I went into it with high expectations and I was not disappointed. French's characters and characterization shine and set her stories apart from most other crime fiction. Some of the strongest scenes for me are when the team of detectives working this murder case are questioning suspects...the ways in which the detectives work together-acting and following each other's leads almost like musicians in a jazz band, or actors doing improv-are a joy to follow. "
"Tana French brings police procedurals up about a million notches. I'm extremely stupid when it comes to these kinds of mysteries; I never figure out whodunit til I'm told. I'm thick that way. But I enjoy the ride, and with French's books, I also enjoy the characters, the language (both written and spoken), the relationships (she describes platonic partnerships in the most heartbreakingly poignant way) and the bleakness of modern-day Dublin.

Many layers. All rain-soaked and sad. But this one ends on a feeling of hope. Hurrah!"
"I almost never read a mystery, until I discovered Tana French. This book was difficult to put down, as all of hers have been. The book was so visual, it was like reading a movie. Detective Antoinette Conway, the victim, Aislinn Murray, who Conway has seen somewhere before. I especially liked the awkward bookstore owner, Rory Fallon who seemed to be always quaking in his boots that he would say the wrong thing. the tracks are laid down in the beginning, and following them is the key to solving this mystery. Recommended."
"I'm always excited about the latest Tana French book and this one did not disappoint. She is such a good writer, you almost forget you're reading a murder mystery, but then one of her many twists and character shifts comes along and you realize how creepy her story really is. As always, at 445 pages, her books are pretty slow in pacing--my only complaint--but it comes together in the end in not some big mind blowing way but instead in a way that is realistic and reasonable after all. Plus who doesn't love a snarky female detective narrator? "
"I love the way her books seem so realistic. It's not all action and shootings. It's not all exciting interviews with shocking confessions. It's tedious stuff that doesn't go anywhere. There's time spent typing up paperwork, conversations that only slightly drive the plot forward, and the slow-processing of thoughts before any action ever takes place. Maybe that seems like a boring novel, but it's probably a much more accurate portrayal of what a detectives life is actually about. I really appreciate that."
"Normally I fly through a Tana French book in just a few days, gripping the author's story hand over hand as become more invested in what's happening. There was something about the first half of this book that kept me from being glued to my chair. Perhaps it was it was Antoinette's penchant for lashing out and her perpetual pessimism, but maybe it was because the reader was meant to be steered as wrong as the characters. By the last quarter of the book I remembered why I love French's detective books and closed the book with great satisfaction. "
I am really biased when it comes to Tana French's novels. I go in expecting it to be great and have yet to be disappointed. While her last book was mysteriously magical The Trespasser returns to a more realistic mystery giving us another glimpse into the world of Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. I really loved Antoinette and while I still sometimes hope we'll get another chance at Cassie's story she is a great female narrator for the Dublin Murder Squad series. As always I can't wait for the next novel. 
"I love Tana French, but [to me] her last two novels haven't been as good as the others. I mean, I still enjoyed them, but they were more average versus what I had come to expect. I started out really liking this one, but after a while the plot felt too thin and stretched and the main character's personality annoyed/frustrated me. With that said, it was well written. As always with her books, the characters felt real and the story really flows and at the end you wish there was more to tell you what happened to the characters next. "
"French is my favorite crime writer for sure and this book is no exception. Antoinette is trying to figure out how a woman who was trying to re-invent herself got murdered. Of course, the detective's own personal story comes to play, not as much as it did in Faithful Place, my favorite of French's, but still suspenseful all the same. I wonder if French's decision to have her central protagonist here be a woman of color with an absent father made it harder for her to tell the backstory. I found the microaggressions pretty spot on, maybe understated.
A good read!"
"""At first I didn't like him--everyone else did, and I don't trust people everyone likes, plus he smiled too much--but that changed fast.""

""If someone rescues you, they own you. Not because you owe them...they own you because you're not the lead in your story any more. You're the poor struggling loser/helpless damsel/plucky sidekick who was saved from danger/dishonor/humiliation by the brilliant brave compassionate hero/heroine, and they get to decide which, because you're not the one running this story, not any more."""
"Detective Antoinette Conway finally worked her way into the Dublin Murder Squad but the other detectives, all men, sabotage her efforts to make good. When she and her partner are thrown what appears to bean open and shut domestic violence case, she is determined to prove herself.

As always, French has written an engrossing mystery with interesting characters and unexpected twists. I got a bit tired of the poor me of Antoinette feeling like everyone on the squad was against her but other than that, this was a good solid, enjoyable story."
"This book may be the best text for mystery writing money can buy.

TF wastes nothing. Just as Charles dickens created opening and closing statements that mirrored each other in A Tale of Two Cities, TF created a similar set of literary bookends with motivations and characters, events and emotions. Most impressively paranoia is so deeply plumbed it becomes an actual character.

As previous novels have led to resolutions without satisfying conclusions, this ending comes out of left field. It's either her best novel to date, or her worst, or neither. In any case I remain stunned."
Tana French is one of my all time favourites though her last novel didn't meet expectations to say the least. But she's right back on form here. Love the jaundiced angry wordsmith Antoinette & her take on life - and the things she gets wrong. OMG what an object lesson she is for cynics the world over. Just brilliant. Oh and the actual crime? That's the only thing that takes it down a notch from 5 to 4 stars as there are times when you want to move the action along faster than French actually does. Yes we got that already .. But the ending makes up for all minor deficiencies. Wow. Just great
"After listening to four of the first five - I could hear the actors read the Dublin Times and be happy - I read The Trespasser the old fashioned way. I was pleased to have Moran back but the reference to Antoinette as the only woman in the squad confused me. What about our heroines in the earlier books? Which begged the question - when in time are these taking place? I thought all were contemporary? This aside, I love French's writing and the world she's created though I wish she'd circle back on some of the previous characters instead of letting live off the page."
"A great book. Like all great books it touches on larger issues, such as the stories we tell ourselves and which come to be straight-jackets to how we think and act. But at its heart this is a great crime novel, well plotted, beautifully written, psychologically astute and well paced. The interviews are some of the best you will read outside of le Carre: they shift and turn on a penny, they are tense and taught like a violin string, as the detectives try to get their suspects to where they need to be to reveal the truth(s)."
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Tana French Murder Squad books. This one was harder for me. For one, I wasn't crazy about Antoinette and her paranoid, chip-on-the-shoulder, mouthy attitude in the book. I didn't hate her, but I was kind of annoyed with her a lot.

The story itself kept me guessing the whole time, and I really loved the interplay between the partners Conway and Moran. They clearly brought out the best in each other.

I wonder who we'll see again the next book. As long as she keeps writing these, I'll keep reading them."
"I had read Tana French's first book in this series, In the Woods, several years ago, but I hadn't realized she'd written five more until recently. While there are some crossover characters, this is a series that can be read out of sequence and still thoroughly enjoyed. Ms. French does an incredible job of immersing us in the interrogation room, and the dialogue is riveting. I have to say that I don't find her protagonist, Antoinette, especially likeable, but all-in-all, this is an enjoyable read."
"Slam Bam! Tana French knows how to knock out a detective story. Nothing predictable, nothing anticipated, nothing conventional except maybe a noir-ish atmosphere that lifts her story out of 2016 and lands it somewhere between Raymond Chandler Boulevard and James M. Cain Avenue. We see the return of D.'s Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran from French's last novel, The Secret Place. The Trespasser is even tighter than its predecessor, claustrophobic even. Not only is the novel character-driven, it is also dialogue-driven. To quote Carly Simon: Nobody Does It Better."
After a slip with book 5 Tana French was back on track with The Trespasser. I couldn't put it down.
"A solid thriller from Tana French. Twisty enough to be believable but with enough going on to keep you guessing. Antoinette Conway is not my favorite French protagonist (the chip-on-her-shoulder thing gets old), but I thought her personality fit will for this particular case and story. I didn't buy the whole 'her dad miraculously found her' thing, but overall this was one of my favorites in the Dublin Murder Squad books. Didn't care for Secret Place or Broken Harbor that much so glad she's back up to snuff. "
"I am a huge Tana French fan and have now read all six of her books. Antoinette Conway is a tough, insecure, smart, smart-alec sort of person - and a great detective. Lots of rapid-fire dialog and interesting insights into police work - especially the interview process. That's what I liked most about the book was how Antoinette and her fellow cops worked the interviews. Some of her other books have been more suspenseful (In The Woods is still my favorite). But this is definitely worth the read."
"I'm not typically one for the murder mystery genre but this novel was excellent. Although it is part of a series, it does not need to be read in order. The story follows Detectives Conway and Moran in Dublin as they try to solve the mystery of a young woman's death. Following the twists and turns of the case as well as the politics in a Murder unit were highlights. I will say Conway's aggressive personality sometimes was beyond distracting... but overall charming, realistic characters. Pick this one up!"
"This, probably more than any of the other novels in this series, was focused on what it actually meant to be a murder detective - from Conway's paranoia (perhaps justified) about the other members of the squad, to the question of competing loyalties to individuals and institutions, this novel asks a lot of difficult questions. I really like Antoinette Conway, the narrator, who is both a badass bitch and an empathetic observer. Now I'm only sad there won't be another new Tana French novel for a couple of years."
"Tana French can do no wrong.

I loved that this addition to the Dublin Murder Squad featured a sole female protagonist. Conway is a no-nonsense broad who commands respect. The story started out a bit slower than some of the other entries in this series, but certainly picks up. I listened to the audiobook CD and loved the narrator's voice. There were great twists in this story. I still am a bit confused about the part with Conway's father, but I will read some reviews to try and understand.

Not as good as ""The Secret Place"" but still a must-read for any murder mystery fan."
"I've enjoyed the entire Dublin Murder Squad series. Having a different case every book being narrated by a different protagonist makes the series continuously interesting. That said, this book has been my favourite in the series. I love Detective Conway's narrative and French's focus on the dynamics of the squad through Conway's firsthand experiences of sexism. Her and Steve are engaging as partners and I found myself entertained by the underlying mystery~ of the case despite it seeming to fall into typical tropes. "
"I wasn't sure at first. I wasn't sure that I liked Detective Antoinette Conway, I had a hard time getting into her voice and getting her to become solid. I had a hard time transitioning away from Moran - secondary in this book, he was the protagonist in the previous book in the series. 'The Trespasser' never took me to that really creepy, sometimes 'paranormal feeling' place that I have loved in some of French's other novels. Despite all this, things came together in a very satisfactory and unpredictable way, which is what you are looking for in a murder story. I really enjoyed this book."
"Zajimavy pohled na prostredi vysetrovaciho tymu, zena detektiv, napeti.."
Tana French delivers again with this one! 
My favourite of this series so far.
Very much enjoyed the character development and tension as the story unfolded. One of my favorite things about Tana French's works is her pattern of making stories from characters previously playing supporting roles in previous novels. It gives more depth to the world she has created.
"I love Tana French's books. She is consistently so good. This book is a slow build with so much detail and characterization weaved through. Sometimes that can make a book too slow or boring, but not this one. You really get to know and understand the characters without having different narrators. There were several different smaller mysteries wrapped up in the larger one. I honestly did not see the end coming. This was so well crafted. "
"I enjoyed this book the most of all The Murder Squad series. I love the detectives Antoinette and Steve. I felt the characters as if I’d known them for years. The victim was finely drawn and relatable as was her best friend. I found this book much easier to follow and less convoluted and I cared who had done it. It felt important that the detectives get this case right. The plot was interesting and exciting and I had trouble putting the book down and was excited to pick it up. I highly recommend this book if you are a fan of Irish mysteries.
Reread 5/4/24"
"Another Murder book, and another Tana French thriller. If you like her books (and I do), you’ll like this one. Don’t worry about the order at this point, “The Trespasser” introduces us to another compelling detective, another tight team, and another case not solved until the end.
French creates fascinating “Ds” that we get to know; in this case maybe a little too well. Lots of Introspection makes this one feel a bit long, but it’s engrossing, and the interrogation scenes are among the very best I’ve ever read.
Back to Ireland! Enjoy."
"Giving this book a very strong 4/5.I would've given it a 5/5 but the language was a bit difficult to get into, with it being written in the present tense. I found myself a bit confused about what actually happened and who was saying what. However, it gives a great glimpse into how it can be being the only woman in a heavily male-dominated field. She shows great character development during the novel, which in my opinion is the actual point of the story, rather then the case. Although I have to say, I did thoroughly enjoy the murder mystery as well! "
"Tana French is back with vengeance in her sixth and newest Dublin Murder Squad novel, the Trespasser. French dives into the mind of Antoinette Conway, a brash and aggressive murder detective, convinced that the rest of her squad is trying to get her to quit, by messing with her investigation of Aislinn Murray's death. Is her squad just personally itching to get her gone, or does it go much deeper than that?"
"Another great story involving Detective Antoinette Conway who is still steadily slogging along on the murder squad. From the title and description of this one I expected something completely different story wise but was very happy with what I was served up.

Tana French knows how to write a good procedural thriller. Her characters are always disturbingly human and majorly flawed. Yet we , the readers, can relate to all of them. Highly recommend this one. You won't be able to put it down."
"There are few authors where I read practically everything they write. Tana French has become one of those authors. I've loved the Dublin Murder Squad books since day one.

This is the 6th book in the series. It's a crazy mind fuck of a book that touches on the struggles of being a woman in a male dominated field and what happens when you try to break open the brotherhood that law enforcement officials have. The Trespasser was truly a good read."
"Much less setting than her other books, which I sorely missed. At least 90% of the book was characters interviewing each other. That said, the tension was almost unbearable in places, and best of all, THANK FUCK NEITHER CONWAY NOR MORAN GOT FIRED OR FUCKED ONE ANOTHER OR DIED.(Assuming there'll BE a next book - anyone willing to bet the new narrator is O'Neill? It was nice to see him mentioned in places. Though if he and Cassie aren't married with six kids I'll probably cry.)"
"I am always on tenterhooks for the next Tana French novel and I've yet to be disappointed by one. About halfway through, I started to feel murky about Antoinette, but, by the end, I adored her and everything she'd gone through. I spent an indecent amount of time wondering who would be the feature player in the next book, which really just means I can't wait to find out! If you like mysteries or thrillers and you haven't read these books yet, what are you waiting for???"
"I have always enjoyed Tana French's variety of characters in her Irish mysteries but this one was a little tougher to follow at times due to the protagonist's Irish dialect and the local vocabulary. Once I got comfortable with the language, however, the plot was vastly intriguing and the characterizations cleverly formulated. A different look at the policing of murder from a female Dublin investigator's perspective."
"I love entering into Tana French's worlds. The characters are all drawn so clearly, so distinctly. Not one person in the novel is flawless. The book changed my feelings about each detective, each suspect, and the victim, more than once, which makes the book so pleasurable to read... I could not wait to get back to it. The plot is not as strong as the people acting it out, but French is still fabulous. "
"Tana French is just so good. I've decided my very favorite thing about her books is the way she describes an interview going well. The partner detectives so in sync, it must read like the way professional dance partners feel. Knowing exactly what the other person is thinking, and being able to change course without having to say a word. Just amazing. This one was a solid mystery and a solid character study, as French does so so well. Great book."
"The Trespasser may be French's most elegant novel, beautifully integrating character development, plot, and theme. Moreover, she accomplishes the rare trick of casting a thick fog of paranoia and then actually increasing the suspense as the true threats come into focus. The partnership between Conway and Moran is compellingly fragile, and the enigma of the murder victim—especially as Conway understands her—is fascinating."
"One of French's better books I think. Glad there was a female main character that 
didn't get caught up in any romance. I liked Stephen Moran... going to have to catch up on The Secret Place since he is the lead in that book with Antoinette as the main supporting character."
"Unlike most Tana French, this is a pretty straightforward police procedural. No element of the unnatural or unusual, just a single timeline, two detectives solving a case.

That said, this book feels like French has taken things to a new level. The alternation between paranoia and resignation proves gut-wrenching over and over, and French expertly raises tension before switching between the two.

One of her best. I'm sad it's over."
"Maybe my favorite Tana French book. This kept me reading and guessing almost all the way through. The ""Likeness"" is still a favorite, even though it is different from the others, but of the others,The Tresspasser is a winner. The detective, Antoinette, is so full of self-doubt, but still getting the job done and looking tough throughout the investigation. Twists and turns and all that I like in a murder mystery."
"Tana French writes fascinating books, and this may be he best yet. She sticks with the Dublin Murder Squad, but has resisted the urge to turn this in to a series with one main character with a predictable supporting cast. Her knack is in unfolding the inner workings of her protagonist's mind at the same time she pushes the plot forward. The result is highly satisfying mysteries with a depth of characterization that is rare in the genre. Highly recommended."
"A bit different then her other books, but a really good demonstration of paranoia and the proverbial ""chip on your shoulder"" syndrome. Antoinette is a great character and she thinks a lot, always analyzing, always evaluating, always contemplating. Ultimately she has to trust her gut, but only after quite a bit of self-analysis. French is excellent at writing dialogue, too. I'd read anything by her."
"My review is actually a 4.5. I simply adore each of the books in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This sixth installment does not disappoint. It's such a gritty and realistic look at the inner workings of a testosterone- filled environment --with the main character a woman. Characters are well- drawn and so believable. And the actual murder plot twists and turns constantly. Truly a novel you'll not want to put down. Highly recommend it.


"
"This is a really engrossing and intricate novel. It truly drops you into the middle of a complex murder investigation and challenges you to figure it out for yourself. The only slight downside I had was that it gets really exposition-heavy toward the end, but I can understand that sometimes that's the only literary way to resolve a really complex plot. This was the first Dublin Murder Squad novel I've read, and now I definitely intend to go back and read the rest from the beginning."
"French nails it again with this gritty new detective protagonist. You want to high five her and throttle her at the same time, but every minute is intense. You never know if you can trust her as a narrator or if you're just seeing her side of the story with her biases. Have to wait until the end to find out!! I did lose interest a few times throughout though - didn't get as hooked as her prior books."
"Enormously satisfying, as always. Rather close to a happy ending, which was more surprising.

I realized it serves as a sort of bookend to In The Woods, 
where Rob and Cassie start out as partners and mates, but end the book estranged. Here, Antoinette and Steve begin as partners but not friends, almost lose everything through Conway's paranoia, and end up as real friends and solid partners."
"Another week in Dublin

A fine ending made this installment as superb as its predecessors, but the middle was bogged down in the protagonist's head. That of course turns out to be the whole point which is beyond clever (well done you!) but turning those middle pages was harder work than turning those leading up to the close. Still I'm left, as always, dying to start the next book."
"This was a tough mystery to get into, which was surprising, since I was very excited for Antoinette Conway's mystery. She was a tough nut to crack (read: like), and it was slow going, especially with all of the theories she and Steven came up with. It wasn't until almost 50% when it started moving for me. But then, it got really good! Totally worth the time, this might end up rank up there with my favorites, next to Faithful Place. "
"All in all, I liked this a good bit. The story was interesting and not overly ridiculous and complicated- its not the most dramatic, over the top crime,nor does it have some insane resolution. But it was still compelling and I was never quite sure what the actual outcome would be. Some of the characters were a bit flat, but Conway and Steve were good. I enjoyed them testing out their dynamics almost more than the main plot line. "
"This book has a really nice plot and resolve, my only issue with it is that all of the characters sort of blur together, because they all talk the same way and there aren't a lot of differentiating characteristics. Tana French has a very descriptive way of writing, and because of this, all of her characters end up talking that way. And the thing is, no one talks that way, with so much fantasy and detail and romanticism. "
"I think this is one of the author's better efforts although it is quite long and slow moving. These books are written in the first person and delve deeper into to the thoughts of the main characters then most others. At first I thought the theme of this book was going to be about workplace discrimination against women, but as I read more I decided it was about the stories some people make up to come to terms with issues in their lives."
"Tana French is just the best. This was a super intense mystery centering on a female murder detective, fairly new on the Dublin murder squad, and the victim of a lot of bullying and harassment. She and her partner get assigned a case that looks like a domestic violence case turned murder, but ends up being a lot more complicated. I'm not sure that I was totally satisfied with the ending but overall I really liked it."
"Another in the series about a female detective in an all male murder police squad. She is assigned to work a murder investigation. She has faced harassment in the past from her male colleagues but during the investigation a few of them are pressuring her to jump to the conclusion instead of conducting a thorough investigation of other possibilities.

This book is a much better book than her past two books and keeps the reader engaged with twists and turns up until the conclusion."
"I felt like this was a classic Tana French book, and I like her books. Her characters are pretty introspective, and in the this case the main character is the only female on the murder squad, and feels that many of her peers are out to get her. She spends quite a bit of time thinking about what her fellow officers think about her. This drives her actions which sometimes change the course of the investigation. This was an entertaining read.
"
"Tana French hits one out of the ball park again! Two members of the Dublin Murder Squad are called to investigate a young woman's murder. It seems quite cut and dried until they interview her ""best"" friend. Something she says doesn't ring true but what it is and what is she hinting at about the dead girl's lifestyle? Atmospheric and curious - full of twists and turns. You never know exactly who is who or what is what until the very last minute."
"Rounded up from 3.5. I don't know why, but I had a really hard time staying focused on this story line. There was a lot to keep track of, but I also kept falling asleep while I was reading. So....

Anyway, Tana French's creepy setting, flawed characters, and twisty plot was still a relatively quick read that was mostly very engaging. It's not The Likeness, but it's definitely better than the last couple of the Dublin Murder Squad novels."
"The Trespassers, IMO, is the best Tana French mystery yet, and that's saying a lot. Plus, while this was pretty gritty, it didn't feel quite as dark as the rest of her Dublin Murder Squad books have. If you're a French fan, or if you're not yet, you should read this book. Plus, it stands on its own, so even if you haven't read the previous five Murder Squad books, you won't feel like there's anything you've missed. Read it!"
"I still love the setup of the series with a new protagonist from the murder (or undercover) squad each time and their personal make-or-break cases. What annoyed me a little more this time is that these characters don't have much of their own voices. They all sound the same, no personal mannerisms and ways of expression, which makes the whole endeavor of changing protagonists much less interesting. "
"I have read all the Tana French books. This book, while not my favorite of hers, delivered her usual excellent narrative, sharp dialogue and characterization. One gift that French always offers is letting the reader discover along with the characters the twists that propel and ultimately solve the mystery. Also, in this book as Antoinette searches for answers about her current case, she gains some insights about herself and shares some wisdom as she ponders. "
"This is the first Tana French book I've read, and, by listening to the audio book, the Irish setting came alive with the Narrator's thick accent. It was a well thought out murder mystery, enjoyable trying to figure out who the killer was while being inside the head of the lead detective. The investigative interviews play out word-for-word, so the dialog makes the book a little too long without a lot happening. It makes it feel more real, though. "
"Tana French does it again...great writing, good story and I had a hard time putting it down. It got knocked down to 4 stars only because I find it really hard to read a book that solid, where the main character (Antoinette) was a complete a*hole the entire time! It got really tiresome and it put a bit of a damper on it for me. Obviously a personal preference, but there was zero personality redemption until the last chapter...just a bit late for me. Other than that, it was still a great read. "
"I always think the best mysteries are those that have a good sense of character, even more so than an impenetrable whodunnit. Tana French's novels definitely qualify. Her previous book Broken Harbor offered the most fascinating portrayal of a nervous breakdown I've ever read. This installment adds to the insight by presenting the psychology of the detectives trying to solve the case, and how their own burdens and fears affect it."
"Stronger editor would have made for a stronger book. The murder is solved, and then a bunch of possibilities are thrown out to unsolve it, and then the original ""solve"" turns out to be -- as it should have been -- the correct solve. There is something a bit pat about the ending. Antoinette realizes that a great many of her wounds are self-inflicted. Instead of quitting, she will march on, determined . . .
But. Most of this is exciting, well-written, engaging . . . good stuff!"
"I hadn't read fiction in a long time before picking this book up after I got it for Christmas, and I was pleasantly surprised to find this one easy to get through and entertaining. The author pulled the mystery together very well allowing the reader to piece things together themselves. I was at 3 points very convinced that there were 3 different culprits in the murder and was surprised still by the end of the book. Great, easy reading for those looking for a light fiction murder mystery."
"I picked this up because I read a review that described it as an exploration of the possible ways for women to wield power, which it was, but it was also a compelling mystery. I particularly enjoyed the main character and her complicated feelings about the very male department she works in.

NB: this is a murder mystery, and the murder victim is a woman, and one of the prime suspects is her boyfriend, so there's a fair bit of discussion of domestic violence."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this, and I think it's a great addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series, but I didn't love it as much as some of the others. The plot moved a little more slowly, and at times dragged a little. That said, I loved getting to spend more time with Antionette. The perspective of a female detective in the male-dominated (to say the least) murder squad was really interesting - especially considering how it influenced her work, for better or worse."
"i dont know, i guess a 3.5. i was really annoyed with the narrator in the beginning, which kept me from getting too into it, and the middle felt so slow (i skipped to the end by like p250ish, but shhh, i went back to the middle the next day), like i get the investigation was going nowhere but those parts could have been cut down a bit man. overall, it definitely got me turning pages, but i was disappointed, and would not read again"
"1. The two books with female narrators have had the ""happiest"" endings, in that the female Ds end their books with a clear path to happiness available to them and they know it, unlike the other books.2. Shit, O'Gorman is out???3. Who on earth will narrate book 7? At one point I assumed it'd be Breslin but it's strongly implied he'll be out too. Maybe the floater Meehan gets promoted? (About to be several open spots.) Gary from Missing Persons?"
I'd give it 4.5 stars. Kept me guessing. I'm definitely a fan of the author!
"Another entry in the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. This one has Det. Antoinette Conway in the center of a case that is trickier than it seems. Should be a slam dunk. But Conway and her young partner, Moran, keep running into other cases, other entanglements and a growing sense that they are being manipulated. By who? Why? The paranoia starts becoming palpable. But it isn't paranoia if everyone really IS out to get you. enjoyed."
"This was a great thriller. There was a bit in the middle when it got to be slow, but the complex characters drew me in and kept me there. More than anything it was how Conway’s future was going to turn out that kept me turning the pages. She is, I think, so representative of how many feel that there are enemies out to get us when there aren’t, or we exacerbate the ones just are there. Ultimately she is stronger than she thinks, and she finds that out doing work that she loves."
"Broke my no big books rule for the year with this. The thing I noticed most was how well the author knows the characters and how skillfully people's behaviours and characters are played off against each other to make the story move. While it is a murder mystery, for me it's more a character study and a story about people's motivations and how they drive us. There's such perfect detail about some scenes and events that I felt the adrenaline rush and the anxiety hitting me."
"This woman really knows how to write a mystery. I don’t usually read multiple books by an author because after a big hit many writers flop but I’ve become quite the Tana French junkie. This one bogged down a bit in the middle, too much detail to remember, and I’m not sure I buy the dead woman’s motivation to do what she does, but the book is still top notch. I’m glad there are more of her books to enjoy, especially when you need diversion during a pandemic."
This is probably towards the bottom of my Tana French novel rankings but that's super relative because she is the best in the entire thriller/crime genre
"After the first few chapters I wondered if I was going to be able to finish, let alone enjoy, this novel. I was really turned off by the main character, Detective Conway. She seemed so angry, so defensive towards everything and everyone, I honestly didn’t see how I could ever warm up to her. But credit to Tana French’s splendidly layered characterization married with a thoroughly complex and twisty mystery to win me over. By the end of the novel I was pulling for Conway to set get things right."
"The protagonist, Detective Conway, made me absolutely crazy but in a good Tana-French-nails-the-character's-personality-right-on-the-head way and like all neat stories Conway is full of personal insight at the end. Full of twists and turns and mystery the mood is less scary than some of French's others but the plot is just as rich and complex. "
I have enjoyed the previous books in this series and equally enjoyed this one. I love the well developed character of Conway with her gutsy attitude. Would like to see how the relationship progresses with Moran though. Fans of previous books will love this one.This book is well written and Tana French does not disappoint. Thank you net Galley for my copy.
"not my favorite Tana French, but as i've said before, any French is WAY better than most books. kept me guessing, loved the dialogue, dialect and inner monologues, too. French's characters are some of the best...not perfect, but want to do the right thing, and struggle by the minute, as most of us do. "
"Man I like Tana French's books! This one maaaaaybe could have used some editing but it clipped right along and Antionette is a fabulous character. The murder victim's name is Aislinn, my daughter's name, that I never hear anywhere so that was fun for me. I'm sure since it takes place in Dublin they pronounce it Ash-leen, but I said it my way (Ace-Lynn) in my head"
"4.5 another terrific Dublin Murder Squad tale from Tana French. As always, beautifully written, intelligent, logical and consistent. You get into the head of the Detectives and stay there, immersed in the case. Thoroughly enjoyable and I'm sorry it's over already. I may have to re-read the whole series now. "
"While this book lacks the luscious prose of French's other books (most likely due to the narrative character being on the blunt side), I was riveted by the complex relationships and somewhat greasy atmosphere. Vivid and deeply written, albeit flawed, this novel is still miles above most popular fiction."
"Conway is not easy to like, which sort of makes her likable. In some ways this was slow-paced, and interview heavy, but by the end enjoyable because I could barely believe what French was doing to her characters. For the most part this series can be read out of order, but I would definitely still keep this one last. It's was also a good pairing with The Secret Place. "
The book had great build up and suspense throughout but unfortunately landed flat right in the end. If I were just finding this series and this book was the first I'd be reluctant to continue. Having read the previous five books in the series I have a higher opinion. I therefore am rating this book four for the overall quality although part of me feels it is more 3.5.
"Great texture

I feel like the author challenges the reader not to like her books because she seemingly goes out of her way not to create likeable characters. That does make it hard sometimes to appreciate her books but she is just so good at putting forward characters and situations that crackle with tension and foreboding, that you forgive her every time."
"I've been reading this series off and on for a couple of years. Somehow I read them out of order. It doesn't really matter because a different detective is the main character for each story. It helped a little that I read The Secret Place before this one, because both detectives were in both that one and this. I like this series and plan to read more."
"4.5 stars. Tana French is the best crime writer out there. Period. The depth of her characters is incredible, and the atmosphere she creates is hyper realistic. I feel jealous of people who can discover the Dublin Murder Squad books and devour all six of them for the first time. I don't want to wait a couple more years for another one!"
"This book has more in depth character development and less action and suspense than previous books in the series. Each book has overlapping characters and references previous books, but the series isn't one you have to follow strictly in order to understand. So grab whichever is available at the library and enjoy!"
"I love Tana French. I've been looking forward to this the way I look forward to a new Stephen King book (the highest compliment I can pay an author). If you haven't read anything from her, start at the beginning of the Dublin Murder Squad series with In the Woods. I highly recommend the entire series. "
"A new Tana French book is always cause for celebration and I have been celebrating my head off all week while reading this terrific book. No matter what you like in a mystery (intriguing characters, twisty plots, psychological thrills, police procedural), Tana French delivers. In my opinion, she is the best detective writer working today."
"Not my favorite Dublin Squad but certainly still good. Antoinette is not my favorite detective and they try to input a back story to legitimize her character but it just wasn't consists enough. The murder mystery was also not very satisfying, I'm glad things were resolved but it was a just barely. I'm hoping the next book is about her partner, since he has been the second person in two books now."
"Hmm, I am midway between a 3.5 and 4 stars for this one. I liked how 
the ending was not quite so tidy but did offer a sense of closure (never going to be sure whether it was murder or manslaughter, though the detective confessed), but Antoinette's 
self-created dramas, including her shutting out of her long-lost dad, was kind of wearying."
"I will give it 4 stars because it is well written and because Tanya French was starting to make me as paranoid as Antoinette. I did not enjoy it as much as her other books. It is a long book but it covers a relatively short period of days. Hence, a lot of detail. Well written detail but it was a bit of a slog which cut my pleasure with the book"
"Love all the books in this series, have to say the who surprised me, I didn't see it coming. Was not my favorite of the series, the victim didn't really come alive for me until the last talk with her friend Lucy, and Antoinette, as lead is pretty unlikeable. But the last 50 pages pretty much kicked butt."
"My favorite part of any Tana French book is getting to take a deep dive into a new character and the world that surrounds them. This didn't have the rich ensemble cast of my favorite French books (Faithful Place and The Secret Place and The Likeness) but I really enjoyed Conway's strong viewpoint, and her friendship with her partner. "
"I love Tana French's prose, and how she develops every character she introduces so well you feel like you might meet them the next time you step out the door. On the other hand the psychological drama feels repetitive (from previous books). Liked Conway as a narrator well enough but she didn't speak to me like Rob or Mackey."
"If you already love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, you will likely enjoy this one too. If you haven't read Tana French yet, read one of the others first. This one was not my favorite - but even so, a good read. Ended strong. Readers who were frustrated with the ambiguous endings of some of her earlier books may prefer this one."
"One of the better thrillers/mysteries that I've read in a long time. I kept reading books that were the next ""Girl on the Train"", but nothing really grabbed me.
I suppose more of a detective story than a thriller, but it kept me glued to the pages.
I'm amazed at how many ways the Irish can use some form of ""gaff"" to mean so many things!

Definitely recommend."
"I read this on my kindle, library book, and I thought it'd be returned partially read. I didn't like it at first. The dialog was slow and seemed like it wasn't carrying the plot forward. I stopped then decided to continue and I'm glad I did. It picked up and then I didn't want to put it down. And, for me, it had a satisfying ending."
"I listened to this book and I enjoyed it so much especially because of Hilda Fay the voice actor. Antoinette Conway the main detective became a real person . I can still hear her voice I learned a great deal about the skill of solving a murder,perhaps a little too much ,it slowed the story a bit . But I am so sorry that it is over."
"Not as enjoyable as the others, but still a 4

Style similar to the Secret Place where most of the book is the thoughts of the two D's and the nuances of the interviews. Not an action book. But why not so enjoyable- think Conway is a less attractive personality so difficult to empathise with."
"I love going on a journey with Tana French. As in all of her previous books- you think things are going one direction- and suddenly, you've been turned about and headed the other way. The emotions evoked from the characters are real, and makes you believe in everything they are feeling. Another work of art! and- I'd actually rate it a 4.5. "
I read everything this author puts out. This series is one that every book draws you in and holds your attention and makes you want to keep reading. She is a master at character development and this book is no exception. The mystery is a little slow but I loved this partner duo. The narrator wasn't my favorite. I'd say 3.5 if I could so I'll round up.
"The Trepasser was my first foray into Tana French's work, and even though it was the sixth book in her Dublin Murder Squad series, I was easily able to dive right in and go along for the ride. The Trepasser is a gritty, hard-boiled detective story, and I now look forward to catching up on the others. "
French writes with a large amount of dialogue. That can be a problem if the author does not have a good ear for dialogue. French does have a good ear and also writes a complicated story that keeps you engaged. She is definitely one of the best contemporary criminal procedure writers at this time.
"I picked up this book right after the election because I knew I needed some Tana French therapy. I can always rely on French to provide a great story, smart and interesting characters, and some awesome twists. For me, this one unfolded more slowly than some of her other books...and I relished every minute. Can't wait for the next one."
"Another good read from Tana French

I liked this book, though maybe not quite as much ad some of her earlier ones. But it still had me up late at night reading!
Dublin Murder Squad is out to solve the killing of a young woman in her home. There are many red herrings to distract us from determining the actual killer. Who knows What and When did they know it!"
Another interesting novel by Tana French. Not that much of a mystery but the characters are interesting and in depth. Learned about the thin blue line of the Murder Squad. Some of the dialects were a little difficult to follow and there were a lot of red herrings but look forward to seeing Antoinette Conway and Steve Morgan in the future. 
"The Trespasser

I have read all of French's books and I like how she features a different detective in each of her books. The last few chapters of this book kept me wondering who the real trespasser was. There are expressions used that are pure dialect, but they are easy to understand, and they keep the story authentic. I really enjoyed this book."
"I am a huge fan of Tana French and In the Woods and Faithful Place were totally 5 star books for me in every way. This story did not grab me as much. The characters were mostly unlikeable and hard as I tried I could not get really invested in the story. But the last 150 pages were so perfectly written with a great ending that I had to give it 4 stars. Don't drag it out - read it in a week.
"
"Ms French is back at the top her game, after the disappointment of ""Secret Place"". Her command of policing, interrogational techniques and the inner dynamics of the almost exclusively male murder squad clique is outstanding. Another deep dive into the heads of these complex characters. Highly recommended."
"I like to take my time with Tana French books because they are so beautifully written, but it's so hard to because I'm always dying to know what happens next!

I really liked this one. Conway and Moran work so well together, and the dynamic within the murder squad makes you feel like you're a part of it all.

Keep writing Tana, I need more!"
"Great detective tale based in Dublin. Two rookie detectives are given a case that looks like a slam dunk domestic violence murder that doesn't quite seem to fit. Lots of good twists and turns, and I really liked the characters. I read as an audiobook, and the various Irish accents were fantastic. I'll definitely read more in this series."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this great thriller featuring tough murder squad detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran. They are tasked with discovering the killer of young and pretty Aislinn Murray. There are many twists and turns as they narrow down the suspects. I even enjoyed trying to figure out what some of the Irish slang meant. "
"I'm not a reader of mystery novels but this one may have won me over to the genre. The characters were well developed, and I like the idea of each book being told from the perspective of a different person on the squad. It was a doorstop making it difficult to read second and third books simultaneously. I enjoyed it immensely nonetheless."
"Good lower class Irish mystery. Antoinette Conway is a detective near Dublin who is experiencing a lot of harassment from her male colleagues. She and her partner are given what looks to be a fairly simple murder case of a young woman murdered in her home just before a new boyfriend came for dinner. Good characters, a few nice twists, my only criticism was that it needed a bit more editing. "
"I am a huge fan of Tana French and, after I finish a book, I search the internet for news of the next one. This book was heavy on police procedure and introspection (with perhaps a bit of paranoia) from Detective Antoinette Conway, the protagonist. It took awhile to reach the conclusion, but it was worth it."
"Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran investigate what seems to be a typical domestic murder, but they soon begin to suspect that there is more to the story. Indeed there is - but it's not what they think. This is the sixth of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad novels and, like the others, it's top quality psychological suspense."
"On to Dublin Murder Squad 1 through 5. French is terrific, a close writer, observant and present in the moment. Not as ""literary"" as fellow Irishwoman Lisa McInerney's The Glorious Heresies - no need for a dictionary to look up fancy words, but masterful prose. And yeah, it's a cop story, with the D's investigating a young woman's murder."
Tana French is one of my favorite writers and this book did not disappoint. This is a mystery that is heavy on the procedural aspect of a murder investigation. All her characters are complex and well written. It was long and at times slow in the middle but I could not put it down when I reached the end.
"The prose, as usual, was superb, but this is my least favorite entry in the series. Many of the events seemed peripheral to the central plot. As a metaphor for (or as the substance of) the distractions that the main character has to overcome, that is very cleverly done, but it makes the story a little less compelling for the reader."
First book of winter break was a good one! The Trespasser is my first book from @bookofthemonthclub - it is about two detectives working a case of a young woman found murdered in her home. It is the 6th book (but the first one I've read) in a series about The Murder Squad - a group of detectives investigating murders in Dublin.
"Tana French reeled me in in In the Woods with her lyrical prose.
A bit less of that here, at least at first, but I was eventually absorbed in its story and antoinette's fears. There are twists and turns, but of a personal, psychological kind rather than of the thrills-and-chills variety in many of the genre."
"I really like Tana French; this one, however, was not my favorite (that goes to Broken Harbor). It's a good, twisty mystery with a satisfying ending, but I really didn't like the main character, Antoinette Conway. She's rude, crude, abrasive and completely paranoid. That said, I would still recommend this to any mystery fan and I'm already looking forward to the next one."
I liked this outing. The mystery was a little slow but Antoinette was one of my favorite POV characters in the series. I think it's pretty obvious that the next book will be about Fleas and will deal with gangs. I find myself wishing that the next book would focus on Sophie the medical examiner and be about bodies found at an abandoned orphanage or Magdalene laundry. 
"Tho Tana French's first two books remain my favorites, ""The Trespasser"" has a lot to recommend. It is a fast-moving, ever-twisting story with engaging characters and lively dialog. And some resonant writing too: ""Waking up the next morning feels like waking up the morning after moving house, switching squad, dumping someone: you know the world is changed, even before you remember how."""
This is not just a mystery. I love Tana French's complex damaged characters. Her insight into her main character takes the mystery police procedural to a new level. The narrative point of view in The Trespasser follows a strong but flawed woman investigator through a complicated case which leads her on her own journey to self awareness. A great read! 
"After a few books that I didn't really care for, Tana French is back on her game. I'm glad it didn't give up on her. With a big chip on her shoulder, Detective Conway is a bit unbearable, but she is the perfect detective to solve this case. With spins and turns, this is an engaging mystery with enough ifs to keep you guessing."
"It was definitely a page turner. Stayed up all night to finish it towards the end. It dragged on a little at parts, particularly with how angsty the main character was, and with the tendency to re-hash the details of the case over and over it felt a bit cheesy. But overall it was really fun and easy to read."
"An tough Irish detective, new in the Homicide dept., and determined to prove her mettle. The language (even though in English), took a little getting used to because it's written in the first person, complete with Irish slang, etc., but it's worth it. A suspenseful twist at the end---couldn't put it down."
"Compared to other books, The Trespasser rates high. Compare to other Tana French books, it isn't one of my favorites. At times, I was a little puzzled, not about the mystery at hand, but why the protagonist was responded to things the way that she was. I felt like I'd missed something. The dynamics of the Murder Squad were more apparent in this novel than in her others. "
Like all of French's books though she is somewhat laborious in her details. But this makes for a perfect police procedural. Main character was almost too tough. The mystery seemed obvious at first (a cop) but with a nice twist. I hope this character reappears and perhaps gets a tad more feminine. 
"It took a couple hundred pages to really start unraveling, but when it did, I was hooked. It's a bit of a deeper crime book that spends more time delving into the psychology behind the murder versus the typical thrilling twists. Unlike Gone Girl, I found the entire book to be extremely plausible and rewarding in the end. "
"The author does a great job with interweaving the story line using characters from previous stories in new ways. I did want to slap the detective around a bit for being a touch bit too obsessed with the ""poor me, everybody is out to get me off the squad"" angle. It was a little bit thick in this book. Still the story is well done overall."
"Tana French and her Dublin murder squad are some of my favorite things in the book world. The newest installment is no different. I really liked Antoinette as the main perspective and French, as always, juggles so much with ease. While the story wasn't terribly surprising, I was invested in the case and enjoyed the way it played out. Another great novel from a fantastic author!"
"I really enjoyed this next installment of the Dublin Murder Squad. This particular novel seemed much more invested in the main detective's inner emotions and thoughts than some of the others. I wouldn't say I liked it more or less because of that, but I liked it differently. A good story, good pacing, and I'm already looking forward to the next book!"
"I am a fan of Tana French novels and this one does not disappoint. It has a strong female lead, a mystery with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end, and a good sense of time and place. Ireland is on my must visit list but reading this book with a map of Dublin next to me almost makes me feel like I'm already there. "
"Irish slang is wild.

Anyway, this was good! I had a little of the murder mystery writing technique that I hate (confessions and theories that take away the readers chance to come to conclusions on their own) but I loved the main character and the level of suspense.

I'll probably be reading more of these!"
"Loved this book. What a juicy character in Antoinette Conway -- smart and complex and brash and not always likable, but always fascinating. The story was fun too -- who did it? So many back and forths -- it was satisfying to get to the end and see where it all landed."
I was guessing until the end. 
Another good one. I can't wait for her next.
"I've read all of the Murder Squad series. I think this is my favorite so far. I still think, though, that the characters are a bit overwrought--man, are they crazy in some truly crazy ways--and the endings always feel a little less planned the rest of the books but i like Moran and Conway together.
I wonder who will be the focus in the next installment."
"I really liked this one. I like the partnership of Moran and Conway. Typically I wouldn't like a woman like Conway but she has just enough true passion and soul and sensitivity that I can relate and get on her level. The case was interesting and the story fast-moving, with a satisfying ending. Look forward to reading more from Tana French. "
"If I’m going to rank Tana French books, this one will fall somewhere in the middle. I loved getting to be in Conway’s head, and I think the gaslighting she experiences on the squad is spot-on. [spoilers below]My only complaint is this is the second convenient stalker situation in her books. Maybe there would have been another way to throw around suspicion without the convenient stalking?"
"I didn’t care for this book during the first half, and fully expected to either abandon it or give it only 2-3 stars, but it redeemed itself in the second half. I loved the first four Dublin Murder Squad books. This one isn’t as good, and the first half had way too much chip-on-the-shoulder bitterness from Detective Conway, but the plot picked up and got interesting later on."
"A simply great read!

April 2023, reread ~ There's one good thing about being a fast reader and consuming piles of books. You don't always remember what you've read so it's like a new story ;-) I found the main female protagonist nearly impossible to like, but the story itself is a page-turner which makes up for it. My initial opinion remains the same, that this is a very entertaining read."
"Another great addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series. I wasn’t a big fan of our lead, Antionette, but found the mystery (and the big reveal at the end) satisfying.

I am glad to see that Tana French is continuing with a series after The Searcher published in 2020, rather than continuing this series for now."
Knocking off 1 star for a particular line of inquiry that didn't make sense to me & I think many readers would see right past. Really enjoyed. LOVE Tana French's work and DELIGHTED to get an ARC of this one 
"I got an early galley copy of this one. If you like French, you'll enjoy this book. The mystery does keep you guessing, but her books are never really about the mystery...they're about the characters and getting inside the head of the main character. At that, as usual, she's extremely successful."
"Excellent, excellent, excellent. This is a long, step-by-step, thought-by-thought police procedural. The narrator is the only female detective on the murder squad, and she has worried herself into being unable to trust anyone. Thoroughly satisfying ending, even though I saw a few things coming."
Another strong literary mystery from French. I did feel that the middle dragged a bit but the theme of people so stuck with the story they make up in their heads that they can not see the truth was well realized in all the major characters. 
"I always enjoy these books - I just wish they were 350 pages instead of 450. After a while, I just get a bit tired of it & am just ready to find out what happened & be done with it. But I really love the stories & the insight into the different detectives thoughts & actions. "
"the most bureau focused one she's written and not my favorite for it; it felt like a few things needed to be expanded on more and others a little less. she's always fabulous, but this didn't leave my eyeballs popping and brain churning the way her best ones have done."
"Very fine addition to the series. Ms. French is a terrific story teller. Wonderful character driven procedural. My full review is here:

"
"mc a bit whingey, turns out she finally realized it. more procedural than I remembered TF being. Still love all the Irish-I don't know if they changed anything for american publication or not. still, enough in there to make me feel part of it, like they are normal, not americanized or whitewashed. "
"Always, always love Tana French, but this one left me feeling disappointed at the end. The reader is not sure which of these ""stories"" is really true, but that's the point. Everyone may spin the same story to suit his own perspective."
" I think Tana French is back on track with this one - I've enjoyed all the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries, and though I thought the voice of the narrator was a bit overdone (we GET it, you feel persecuted), the whole book worked for me. "
"I wonder if Tana had become overly plot-conscious. The magic of the first four books, I think, is how they go deep into their characters. Still, this was an enjoyable read with only a few conveniently long and explanatory conversations."
This is back to the one voice style which I much prefer. French is a great writer and draws unexpected characters with skills few current writers have. She takes her time so you know it's time to settle in for the ride. 
"Fascinating characters, intriguing plot ... initially I was impatient with the interrogation scenes but soon appreciated how cleverly they are used by the author. The suspense builds to the very end and I couldn't put it down."
"I love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad Mysteries for one reason—solving the actual crime has very little to do with the story. It is about solving the mysteries of the detectives involved in the investigation. So nothing is wrapped up neatly, everything is raw. Human."
"4.75. French's mind is scary - how she comes up with the plot twists, characters so finely described, and always the consequences of one's actions. One of her best books, though it feels as though I usually say that about her newest."
Tana French is always a fun read for me (even though her books are dark). This one was not as dire as the book's plot summary led me to believe and I enjoyed that there was a female protagonist for this one.
"Brilliant. We went on a bit of a journey of self discovery with the narrator while she pieced together the murder mystery at the center of the story. I liked The Likeness and The Secret Place better, but everything Tana French writes is just masterful."
"The four stars is for every interrogation scene. Those were magic, just really fantastic writing. The rest of the book was just...grating. I ended up liking the book, but I didn't love it like I do her previous books. "
"Tana French returns to her awesome self after the hiccup of Broken Harbor. I loved this book. The Irish dialogue, the well established characters, the captivating plot...all made for a winning book in this inter-related detective series."
"This is the most astoundingly long-winded of her increasingly long-winded stories. Lots of twists and turns, more than most of us would want to know about the political workings of a police department, but I end up wondering if I really wanted to spend this much time on this story."
"Took me forever to get into...unusual for me when reading French. The second half made it worth the wait. My favorite in the series remains The Secret Place, but French's characters are well developed the end felt right."
"Another great read by Tana French. It was terrific to ride along in Detective Antoinette Conway's head, especially during her interrogations. I was guessing which way it all would go right up to the end."
"Not my favorite Tana French, but even that means it's outstanding. This one took a while to grow on me, with a difficult-on-purpose main character and a slow pace heavy on dialog. But stick around. Antoinette will grow on you and the mystery untangles itself satisfactorily."
"This was my first Tana French mystery, after reading many glowing Modern Mrs. Darcy reviews. I found this one to be verrry detailed and drawn out, but it is an excellent mystery for those who love modern crime and detective novels. Not for the faint of heart due to language and some gory details. "
"This book draws you in

I found myself drawn into this novel to the point that I could not put it down. The writing is sharp and spare, the dialogue first rate. This was my first novel by French, but it won't be the last."
Another great Tana French. I have to say the paranoia in this book made me a little twitchy. I didn't enjoy the detective portion of the plot as much as the murder part. But as usual I felt like I was there and actually felt like I knew the characters by the time it was over. 
"Tana French is one of my favorite authors and I had a tough time getting sucked into this one. However, once it happened, I was reading well into the night. French never disappoints and I just wish she had 4709273508084 more books ready for me. "
"I never wanted to put this one down. The thing with the dad lurking around her place peters off uneventfully and is never heard from again, which feels unnecessarily shoehorned in place. But overall, I'm totes addicted to French's work."
"My real rating would be more of a 3.75 stars. I liked the story but didn't find it as compelling as the other books in the series. Conway was a good character for the most part, but her ""the world is out to get me"" attitude was tiresome after a while. "
Excellent suspense-filled tale! Lots of twists and turns; I couldn't put it down! This is a story of a female police detective who is in charge of a case about the murder of a young woman in her home.
"I listened to an audio version of this book and it was very entertaining! The Irish accent really added to the ""reading"" experience. The story was satisfying and complex. I was not disappointed in this addition to the Dublin Murder Squad."
"I don't know that Tana French could write a book I don't like. I really liked this one for the most part but in some places it's just a little out there for me. Though, I suppose that's sort of the point. Another great book, however, and hopefully put me back into a reading frame of mind."
"I love these books. The last one didn't wow me, but Tana French is back. Could not put it down. Sad to see it end but grateful to have my life back! Great, flawed characters, pitch-perfect dialogue and a mystery that kept me guessing till the end excellent. "
"I've never had 'Irish stew' but imagine this book is like the best kind: chock full of meat, root vegetables, and broth, all slow-cooked until the flavors meld. the story is dark and dense, with secrets that are rooted in the past."
"Lots of stuff going on in this one! Main character Antoinette is the only woman on the murder squad and thinks the rest of the guys have it in for her. She and her partner catch a murder case and we're off to the races.






"
"Perhaps my favorite of the series, although I loved Broken Harbor and Faithful Place, too. Can't wait to see what's up next for the Murder Squad! Antoinette Conway is a great protagonist but I am guessing it will be someone else's turn next.
"
"I loved this book. It was suspenseful and exciting without being over the top. I love the style of all of her books. It is always more about the journey than about who did it, although I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know who did it.
"
At first this book was irritating. Det Antoinette Conway has an attitude that gets pretty tiring and you just want to tell her to grow up. But keep reading because it's a great story with implications that connect all in the squad. 
"Excellent crime story, police procedural actually, set in Dublin. I have not read the previous books in the series, and it might have helped to have a little back story but I think this works just fine as a stand alone. Enjoyed it immensely. "
"I hadn't known this book was one of a series. It was my first Tana French novel and probably won't be my last. I came upon this title in the New York Times. While I rarely read crime novels, this one was recommended. Too long, but I never wanted to give up. Good read!"
"Tana French at her best! This is my third Dublin Murder Squad book and third Tana French, and she is consistently very good. Always keeping the reader on their toes, while drawing them in all the time. I would recommend Tana French to anyone who loves a well written thriller. "
"I have enjoyed all the books in this series, but I think this one might be my favorite so far. It is a great series to listen to, because the narrators are excellent. Of course the Irish accents don't hurt!"
"Really enjoyed this book and the reader, much better than her last installment. She really dug deep into the characters and it kept me on my toes the whole time! Nothing life changing, but good mindless entertainment. "
"Tana French is back on track after Secret Place went off the rails. The last 40 pages of this book totally played me, loved the emotional roller coaster of anger, dejection, fatalism, and then, surprisingly, justice."
"Tana French knocks it out with another intricate story of Ireland the Murder Squad. No spoilers, this one kept me intrigued and turning the pages. Broken Harbor still my favorite, but this one was still good. "
"På høyden med seg selv igjen, etter at den forrige skuffet meg. Elsker dette her, virkelig. Nå er jeg bare nysgjerrig på hvem som kommer til å være D i neste bok, håper (faktisk) litt på Roche eller kanskje Breslin. Gleder meg uansett. "
"I didn't realize this is considered a series, so maybe that explains the trouble I had with the beginning. It took almost half the book for me to lock into it and feel like I wanted to keep reading. However, once into the book I couldn't wait to hear the end. Definitely enjoyable. "
"So after I read this book I find out it is part of a series. Darn. I like to read series in order. Well I will go back and read them all! Dublin murder squad with a complicated case. Lots of detail, thoughts, conversations. Good book!"
"This is the first murder mystery/crime novel I’ve ever read. The badass female protagonist, Detective Antoinette Conway, made me want to join the nearest precinct. There’s a lot to wade through, but unpredictable twists and turns kept me going."
"this is one of my fav tana French books ( and they are all immensely enjoyable). probably one of the better main characters (unique,flawed and a lil obsessive, great to ""hang out"" with them for the book). good plot. I think faithful place still wins as my fav TF book though."
"I love Tana French-- she always builds an amazing array of characters, creates an involved plot, and lets the reader guess at the conclusion, ready or not! This novel was more of the same. Lovely >^..^<
"
"French's writing is captivating as always. The plot took some time to get moving but the characters were good. By the end, I was ready for it to be over and was satisfied with the outcome. This is about #4 for me re: her other writings - worth a read once you're done with the others!"
"Maybe 3.5. Definitely her weakest book. I actually put it down for about two weeks because I found it boring. But the writing is still miles better than any other thriller writer out there, so that saved it. "
"I had not heard of this series before seeing the last one on several ""best of 2016"" lists. It was a little difficult to get used to the Dublin slang, but I really liked the ending. Now I'm going back to the beginning and read the rest of them!"
"Another quick read by Tana French! I've liked all her books, though some more than others, and this was a good one. It's no ""In the Woods,"" tying up the loose ends and wrapping up neatly, but it still had some twists."
"Loved this. I was in hook, line, and sinker. Character-driven, disparate but complementary partners, nothing fantastical, just clever Dublin detective work and begrudging but satisfying character development within a whodunit. My favorite from French since ""The Likeness."""
"I really enjoyed this book. French writes a tight sentence and I liked following her words closely. In this case we get to follow the thinking of the detective through many a maze and then come out again. French kept me turning pages and I thought the ending was satisfying.

"
"A great way to start the new year - with the Dublin Murder Squad! The Irish profanity was excessive, and the story could have probably been told in way less than 450 pages. That said, I still loved it! It was both plot and character-driven and kept me guessing till the end."
"Although it took me forever (by my standards) to finish this book, it's not the author's fault. I just had too many other things to do! But, once again, French delivers a well-crafted and complex story."
"Maybe my favorite French yet - though the top Dublin Murder Squad ones all tend to delight me, so I don't want to make them fight for first place. I enjoyed the dynamics of the detective duo and the squad as a whole, and being transported to a Dublin I both know and don't know. "
Very enjoyable detective novel as it had many twists and turns that kept my interest high. The main character was quite a piece of work so it was challenging to get a handle on what she would do next.
"I really enjoy this series and Tana French's writing. Becuase I read them out of order, starting with #4, I don't get hung up on the characters moving from book to book. If you think of them as individual books, they might even be better. So good."
"Highly recommend this book. You won't be able to put it down...some rough language and Irish (Dublin) colloquialisms and police acronyms, but everything fits into the tone of the book. Having newly ""discovered"" this author, I'm eager to read her other novels. "
"Another great mystery from French, who uses Detective Antoinette Conway and her case to explore the ways the stories we tell ourselves about our lives can get in the way of our real lives, occasionally leading to disaster. "
"So very glad to learn in this novel that there are some two dozen or so Ds on the squad, which means French has got at least 24 more potential stories, before she has to move to other police departments."
Really liked this mystery/thriller and it's a 4.5 for me. Love how French pays equal attention to character development and suspenseful plot. She takes care to provide all the subtle details that create a believable and specific environment. 
"Great combination of suspense and humor. This was the first Tana French novel I have read, but I will do more. I like the feisty Antoinette ! (I listened to this audiobook, and it was enhanced because of the wonderful brogue of the reader!)"
"Long but good. Antoinette Conway finally made it to the murder squad, but it's vicious pranks and harassment. Then she and her partner land a case that everyone wants to close quickly. Lots of locker room talk, but it's part of the atmosphere."
Had a somewhat difficult time getting through the middle 3rd of the book. But it's definitely another winner for French. I'd love if they made this series into a Netflix show. I love me some British procedurals to binge watch on Netflix.
"What can I say? I love the Dublin Murder Squad! For some reason, it took me longer to get into this story than the other five. However, it has the same clever dialogue and psychological tension that I so enjoy!"
I really enjoy this authors characters - they could live in my town - they have human flaws and emotions and strength. I also love the way she writes with her English/Irish/Scottish brogue and terminology. A solid 4.5 
4.5 Stars for me. My favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad by far - love the direction the unreliability of the narrative (always a feature in these books) takes in this one. The ending was a bit abrupt for me or it would have been a 5-star.
"A very great read by Tana French, again! This one was a bit slow to grab me, but I've read enough of her work to stick with it, and was rewarded with a satisfying and thought-provoking (but not simple) resolution ."
I've found a new fave author! This is my first read in this Dublin Murder Squad series - can't wait to start over at the beginning. Crystal clear writing and personification -- overwhelmed by all the detail. It's like I was there. Brilliant. Highly recommend.
"Best one yet!

My favorite Tana French mystery, by far. Great characters, good story, rich, gritty, and prose that leaves your eyes stinging from the cold Irish wind. Hoping the next book has more with these two detectives!"
"These books say ""Dublin Murder Squad"" but each can be read as a stand-alone book. I found myself wishing things would happen that didn't and not seeing things that did happen. You won't be disappointed in this author "
"Pretty long.
I haven't followed the whole series.
Lots of twists and a reminder that things are not always as they seem.
Loved the narrator's accent."
"Tana French has now entered that territory where I ask, ""When is her next book due out?"" I especially like the way that one character from each book, different each time, carries forward to the next book."
I haven't read the other books in the series but read this on recommendation. It can be read as a stand-alone. I found it well written and gripping. The description and character development added depth to a plot that had me hooked and thinking.
"Not my favorite of the Tana French Dublin Murder Squad series, but I enjoyed the character development (Antoinette Conway in particular) in this one. The reveal at the end wasn't anything much (IMHO) but I enjoyed the murder story in this one much better than The Secret Place (book #5),."
I am glad I went back and re read this so it was in the series order. I missed a lot of background by reading this first. Good writing. Excellent on blurring lines between who is good and who is not. 
"As usual the plot is top notch. My only complaint is that I didn't really like Antoinette Conway, even though the reason I didn't like her paid off in the end. But after two books with these detectives I'm ready to move on to new ones."
"These books are getting a little repetitive (mostly in writing style; I need to go descriptive-metaphor-free for a few days to cleanse my palate), but I keep buying them in airports so ... mission accomplished. "
Re-read this book after reading it out of order the first time. I love the pair of conway and Moran. This novel is a gut-punch and a good solve. Tana French can sure write dialogue and a good detective novel.
"Picked this up, read it out of order, it is # 6 in the series. A solid read, very enjoyable. Loved how Tana French explores how our point of view affects our dealings, how we perceive people reacting to us, how we can fool ourselves.

Antoinette Conway is my favorite character in this series."
"Really Noone this author, have read all 6 of her murder squad and with the exception of the secret place loved them."
Tana French does not disappoint with The Trespasser. Conway makes for a great protagonist and I loved the ending. Just when you think you know what French will do... 
"Another great book. I love how she takes a minor character from a past book and focuses on them in the next book. The killer seems to be a slam dunk, but is it?"
"Started slowly, but amped up to a blockbuster ending. "
"Tana French is the queen of crime. The only flaw is that I solve her mysteries too early, but the rest of the ride is nonetheless never boring. The writing is top notch."
Her best yet. 
Another great work by Tana French. A quick page-turner. 
"A good, solid story. As much about the characters as the crime."
"I will have a full review coming soon, but I really enjoyed this novel. In my opinion, it was much better than her last novel 'The Secret Place.' Definitely classic Tana French. "
This could be the best one yet! What I love about Tana French is her dialogue and her description and the contrast between them. She writes brilliantly about Ireland and her characters seem so real.
"A Good Reads win. A really gripping detective novel. Intricately plotted with good characterisation of the gritty Antoinette Conway, her partner Steve and the slimy Bres. Really enjoyable."
"I love a good Tana French mystery. Irish, character-driven, gritty, atmospheric, and immersive.

(Note--if are put off by language and profanity, you'll want to steer clear of this one.)"
"TANA FRENCH HAS A NEW BOOK OUT!!

and like always, it's damn good. not my favorite of the murder squad novels, but a very solid book. i'll read anything this lady puts out."
"I like the way Tana French writes, and with each book in the Dublin Murder Squad her characters become more complex and involved. Very engrossing read!"
Very good police procedural mystery as are the previous Dublin Murder Squad books. this book focuses on Antoinette's bad relationships with most of the other murder squad detectives. 
Another great detective case. I enjoyed the development of the main character as she works the case and deals with personal and work culture issues and the parallels to the case itself.
Back up to excellence. It seems the last one was a fluke!
This one was as good as her first three novels (and much better than the previous one). 
Always a page turner but none have matched the first in this series.
"Love the atmosphere & language of Ireland in French's novels. Murder mystery and police drama supreme. Read all her books now!

Avoiding spoilers so read the dang book."
Another great entry in the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries.
"4.5 stars. Intricately plotted, great characterization."
"Thought it was slow going & repetitive at first (too much explanation of the chip on the narrator's shoulder), but the inevitable twists were worth it in the end."
"I thought the book was absolutely fantastic, but I'm only giving it four stars because I guessed who did it and why within the first few chapters of the book."
"I didn't find this book to be as psychologically compelling as French's books usually are, but it was a good mystery story nonetheless! "
I enjoy her books. Very plot driven.... would make a good movie! Want to give it a 3.5.
what a wild ride!
Tana French has such a way with words. She creates great female detectives.
Although I think it stalled a bit in the middle the story kept me reading and wondering who done it.
"Wow. New characters. Same Dublin. Building info for first pages, then couldn't put down! Back to real Tana French murder series."
can't wait for the next one!
A tad slow at times but Tana French brings every character 100% to life. Much better than her last one and now can't wait for what's next.
"Chock full of unlikable characters and I mostly solved it halfway through, but still sharply written. Couldn't put it down. "
Less stellar than her other novels but worth it for the female lead detective and return of Stephen Moran.
"Another great Tana French book. Took me awhile to get into this one, but still another good read!"
"Excellent, as always. Great characterizations of female officer and victim. Not as gripping as The Likeness and Broken Harbor, but still very worth the wait."
"A psychological police procedural, focused more on the squad than on the actual case. French has turned out another fascinating story with a unique perspective."
"Good murder mystery, even better examination of the relationships among Dublin murder squad detectives."
These Dublin Murder Squad books are very good
Love her but found this one stressful and a little unpleasant to read. 
Fast paced and enjoyable. I just wish I didn't have to say SHUT UP at the main character as often as I did. Her angst gets a little precious after a while. 
great writing as always; did not like the character Antoinette Conway - maybe that's the author's intent.
Another Dublin Murder Squad crime thriller. Great psychological thrillers. Excellent character developement.
I am so heart eyes over Tana French lately. 
A little slower start for me but by the end I was hooked! Sad to have to wait for the next one. 
un-put-downable
"As ever, French keeps it interesting until the end. This is another good installment in a great series."
"Best one yet.
"
One of the best in the series so far.
"not my favorite protagonist, but enjoyed this latest entry in the series. give me frank mackey any day..."
As always Tana French delivers great writing and good storylines! 
Why is Antoinette SO angry?
"Classic Tana French: tight prose, fast pace, good story. "
"A good ""Who done it"" book

This book kept you guessing until the end who murdered Aislinn. I enjoyed the book even though it was a bit long."
 Couldn't put it down!! Good one. 
Three and a half stars. I enjoyed the book and getting inside Detective Conway's thought process but I didn't love it as much as some of the other books in this series
"Lost points for the Daddy MacGuffin, but the series is still good. Can't wait to see how the ending affects the next book. "
4.5/5
Another great one from Tana French. A bit different as it focused a lot more on the squad room. Definitely an ending that left you thinking long after you closed the book.
A bit more speculations along the way than previous ones but just as good. 
Great narration on audiobook.
"Another well crafted story by Tana French. Characters are well described, story is interesting."
Always a good read/listen. Had to finish before I went to sleep. I wonder which detective will be featured next?
I like everything Tana French writes. This one was good. Into the Woods was still better.
18 CDs but it held my interest. 
"Very well written, I loved the lingo and the characters. "
"The protagonist's attitude can be a bit wearing at times, but well written with a great twist"
"Re-read / audio book this time. Love the reader who
Can do the accents well.

Always so good. Less ""creep factor"" than other ones, but another great character and dialogue."
4.5 stars for the happy ending
"""In the Woods"" is still my favorite but this is a definite second place."
"4.5 stars

I think this is my favorite Tana French novel yet! The interrogation scenes were particularly well-written. I also really enjoyed the return of the partnership of Moran and Conway."
"I love Tana French so much, and this book is no exception. I devoured it in two days."
"I love this series, and this is one of the best."
"Well done -- lots of plot twists, interesting characters."
3.5. 
"Engrossing - focuses more on the dysfunction of the squad room than the crime itself. Which, of course, turns out to be the key. Great, neurotic, defensive angry female protagonist. "
It wasn't a nail biter like I'm used to from French but still pretty good. 
Enjoyable and addictive as always. Appreciated that it was a head-games centered mystery.
"Whew. Thank goodness the book ended the way it did. It was hard living in the narrator's head, but it was worth it."
Good story.
"The latest in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This was probably my least favorite in the series - the middle part of the book just seemed to go on and on, but I still liked it."
Tana French is always a solid read. Great mystery and interesting characters.
French always tells a good story with fleshed out realistic characters. 
"This author does not disappoint, that said, this time I could have done with less navel gazing from the main character. Still a very good read"
"I was so happy to see that Tana French returned to the excellence of her books before The Secret Place. I love her razor sharp prose, and the very human characters she creates."
Best one since Faithful Place. Don't @ me. 
"better than the Secret Place, her last one. there is a minor character who I think would be a great protagonist for her next book."
Slow to warm up to this one but the last half was amazing. 
"More than a mystery writer, French is a writer of characters and captures very diverse voices in each one"
Another fine novel in the Dublin Murder Squad series!
Really enjoyed this book.
"Another gem from what is, without a doubt, the best book series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Tana French, marry me??"
"Whew! Now I can go back to my life. It's a good one that you won't want to put down, so carve out some time before you get started. Enjoy!"
Another great book by Tana French! 
"Great mystery that kept me guessing, but I struggled to finish the last 75 pages or so. In true form, the characters bandy about quite a bit of crude language. "
"Fun read, as usual. Pretty easy to identify who did it earlier than I like...but still fun."
As aways a good listen :)
"Couldn't decide between 3 or 4. I really love Tana French books but this one was not my favorite. Still, I'll be watching for the next edition:)"
"Another engaging read from Tana French. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the others in part, I think, because the narrator was not all that likeable. But, for the most part it kept my interest. "
"This author is consistently good. A great mystery but also gives insight into the individual dysfunctional work dynamics that can occur with a ""murder"" police squad. Interesting perspective."
"Tana French, once again, does not disappoint! She is so skilled at character development the characters I don't even like I love in the end. "
I love Tana French. Another great murder squad book. I couldn't stop reading. 
Tana French fans: this is a good 'un.
Tana French = still the master. 
"So good. Had to stay up to finish it. Perfect blend of psychology, mystery and Irish slang."
3.5!
"The case that this story hung around was far-fetched, but the psychology was right on. All about the stories we tell ourselves in our heads and how they shape our actions. Great read. "
"I did like this book, but there were some sections that I felt could have been shortened. All around this was a great mystery story that left the reader guessing what would happened next!"
The mystery wasn't my favorite but I always love Tana French's characters.
Another page turner from Tana French... her writing and deep character development sucks me in every time. 
"Another solid book by Tana French. I did figure this one out which unusual for her books, but thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I have been waiting for the publication of this one and I was not disappointed.
As usual, we have a good character description, even if Antoinette Conway is not the most likable of the detectives.
"
"I don't usually read murder books, so was glad when this wasn't gross or creepy. I needed an Irish slang dictionary though."
Short of 5 stars only because Antoinette began to grate on me a bit. Otherwise solid mystery. A less than perfect Tana French still beats most others!
Another great Tana French novel. New detectives. She writes a great mystery.
French in top form. Maybe my favorite of the series.
Really good read.....
Two wonderful detectives. One of my favorites this year. 
Riveting.
"Wow. Just wow. Even after all this time, Tana French still didn't lose her touch.

And please, please tell this isn't the last one. Pretty please?"
"Great story

A bit difficult to get through the English expressions- but definitely worth it. A few twists and turns but I was totally engaged in the story."
"I haven't read anything by her in years, and really enjoyed it. I want to read the previous one now. "
Probably the best of the series so far. 
"Good story, but not the page turner expected.

Have read all her novels. This one was a bit slow and it seemed to take forever to tell the story. Still enjoyed it."
I love this series and Ms. French's writing style. This one started out a bit slow the kept me guessing until the end. Really good.
This book hooked me even though the Irish slang was sometimes hard for me to follow. 
Love Tana French. 
This was a great book. Very suspenseful! I listened to as an audiobook and the narrator was wonderful! LOVED her Irish accent. I love all of Tana French's books. Check it out!
Long book but I enjoyed the storyline and charachters
Love her books. Good read!
"I wasn't thrilled with the chip on the shoulder plotline, but French makes it work by the end. Spoiler alert: she works in a reference to Trump. UGH!"
"4.5. Very talented author, excellent book!"
"A page turner with lots of twists, beautifully written."
Tana French keeps getting better. This one was fabulous and without the weirdness of the previous entry in the series. So great. 
"Sharp, pacy page turner.
Certainly not my usual fare and while I may not return to the crime genre again for a little while, I enjoyed it."
Good detective novel with a twist.
Tana French never disappoints!
Started a little harsh but ended up a terrific plot with more twists than you can imagine. 
"Excellent mystery, police drama, and female detective protagonist.
"
4.50
A very good read. Lovely plot twists with good description of police procedures.
"Great, as usual! Although the beginning was slow, once it got going, I had to keep reading. And in true Tana fashion, there are unexpected twists. "
"Her best book by far. She writes well, no doubt. Some parts of her stories I find questionable, although I have read every book and enjoyed them. This and Faithful Place are my favorites."
"Tana French is one of my favorites and this is one of her best. Love the narrator's voice.
"
"Not one of Tana's better ones. I had a hard time connecting with tha main charahter -

But us a plot line it was a good read"
the stories we tell ourselves
"Another great crime and detective procedural, along with a good bit of psychological motive revelation--a solid Tana French!
"
"Good gritty mystery set in Ireland, strong female POC protagonist (handled well, I think, by French, who is white)."
Terrific mystery I almost gave up on more than once. Interminable conversations. 
I rounded up a bit. A few too many convenient coincidences but as always a good and suspenseful read. 
"A bit slow in the beginning, and some of the plot devices were a bit tedious (long, long interview with a key witness), but she is a good writer --- I will read more of her work."
"A few turnarounds that worried me but as usual, Tana French came through with a great book."
"Bad guy is easy to spot, but the narrative voice is so strong that it just doesn't matter.

Recommended."
"See my review here:

http://whatmeread.wordpress.com/2017/..."
"Maybe a little bit slower than her other books, but still a great read!"
"A clever, suspenseful mystery a bit long but very intriguing.
How the absence of a father messes one up so much......."
"4.5
"
"Minus the amount of cussing, I enjoyed this storyline"
"I love this series, and this could be my favorite one of the bunch.
I didn't remember Antoinette from her earlier appearance but I read somewhere she was in Faithful Place.
4.5 stars."
Not as good as Tana French's others.
"Broken Harbor was perhaps a hair better, but this was right up there among the best of the series. An excellent return to form."
"Good story, however the storyline goes in a lot of differest directions."
"Not as good as some of hers, but a good book. I like this series."
One of Tana French's best books - great murder investigation!
"Still love Tana French's first 4 books the most, but I enjoyed this one. "
Really enjoyed this. Most of the action occurred through the interviews which surprisingly I liked. I thought the characters were all very interesting.
"This book is good, it truly is. But I can't help but compare it to other French books. This book was not as tense or fast-paced as her other novels. "
This one had a more satisfying ending than her other books.
Antoinette and her partner James are the newbies in Dublin's Murder squad. They've just been handed a complicated murder and are determined to prove themselves by solving it.
Living right up to her other books .. could not put it down (especially since it was a 7 day check-out book at the library)!
Another murder mystery solved by unusual events. Cheers to Tana French. 
"One of my favorite series, this book did not disappoint!"
"I wasn't crazy about Antoinette Conway - she was not an easy person to like, but the story was kick-ass."
"Excellent, entertaining read."
A truly gripping read and very suspenseful. Tana is a good writer!
"4.5 stars, the best Dublin Murder Squad book yet!"
Such depth and detail in her characters. Does not disappoint. 
Solid.
first book I have read in this series. Will read more.
"Another wonderful book by Tana French! Love her character development and her descriptions! Original plots, never formulaic."
"Not my favorite Tana French, but I like them all!! Another good lead female detective in Dublin."
"This was my first Tana French book and was not disappointed. I do have to say that the first 100 pages or so were hard to get thru. Push thru it, it get so much better. "
Dublin murder with Detective Antoinette Conway
"It is really annoying at times, but it gets better and better as it goes on. I like Tana French, but did not like ""The Secret Place"". This book is good."
"Another fantastic read...highly recommend
"
"Dublin, Ireland. Internal police detective murder mystery."
Good Irish cop mystery.
Dublin police department. Covers a female detective working her way through the male dominated Murder dept. Lots of false starts and plot changes. Interesting.
"It strained believability at times and was depressing as all get out, but she finally learned how to end a book well. Yeah!"
4.5 stars. This is probably my favourite Tana French novel so far. A great return to form.
I always enjoy the Dublin Murder Aquas books. This one was pretty good with a solid main character. 
"Tana French never fails. Character, plot, surprises, great writing: her books have it all. I eagerly await the next one!"
My favorite Detective Conway ... so far
"It's so weird, I swear I reviewed this book. I'm planning a re-read, so review TBD."
Great characters and accents! You are there with a fun great audio experience!
"Excellent book, just like the rest of hers. You don't need to read them in order, either."
"Another great Dublin Murder Squad book. Maybe it wasn't my favorite, but I still found it compelling. "
"Good story. One little complaint is that French's books sometimes go really dialogue heavy -- like, pages and pages of dialogue without narrative or exposition."
"I was really drawn in but, not to give too many details or spoilers, but it proved to be a bit predictable.."
"I wonder who the next book's narrator will be? I hope it's O'Kelly. Or Conway's old boss, Gary."
I really liked the ending and the murder mystery but I had a hard time liking the main character. 
"I liked this well enough, better than the last few. I just wish she'd get on with it so I can figure out why the kid in be the first one was found tied to a tree with bloody shoes. "
"Tana French's books are always engaging and well-written. These books are in the mystery/thriller genre, to which French was my introduction. She remains my favorite author of this style. "
Not my fav book by Ms. French. I liked a couple of her other books more than this one.
"Not my favorite Tana ever, but a great book. "
"Great book, as good as her others."
Engrossing. Had me guessing right to the last page. Very believable detectives with lots of daily life detail into squad life. Terrific!
Very good! I liked this one better than the last one. Conway annoyed me a bit but she pulled through in the end. 
"I like her police procedurals, though the accents and we're-so-working-class aura are a little thick. But I will read the next one."
"A solid mystery. Not my favorite of hers, but a good read with enough twists to keep you guessing. "
"Her character development is on par with ""Robert Galbraith's"" when it comes to the mystery genre. Just really excellent. "
"Each time I read an installment of the Dublin Murder Squad, I want more. Can't wait for the next book!"
No one writes a police detective interview scene as well as Tana French. 
Audio. Really good listen. The story line kept me guessing. Loved the characters. Will be going back to read the earlier books in the series.
"Antoinette is a wonderfully complex and flawed protagonist, and this is French's best novel to date- intellectually complex characters and stories, and a glimpse into the psychology of police."
"I might have gone with 5 stars, but Antoinette's paranoia was really starting to get on my nerves. Other than that, I thought it was superbly done."
"I liked this book quite a bit, but not as much as the first three. Perhaps it's because I couldn't warm to Antoinette's all consuming anger. Anyway much better than The Secret Place IMHO"
Her best since In The Woods. I couldn't put it down. Excellent observations of people 
My only sadness upon finishing this book is knowing that it's unlikely the same characters will recur in French's next book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. 
An excellent read. Probably her best yet
"my favorite book in the series so far, liked revisiting these past characters and the storyline."
Gotta love that Dublin Murder Squad!
"Good suspense novel. Plus Antoinette, the female murder detective featured in the novel, is wicked smart but has fascinating weak spots. Snappy dialogue with well-written characters."
"I love Tana French, though this is not my favorite she has done, it was still good."
"Excellent addition to the Dublin Murder Squad collection. Taut throughout. I loved having Conway as the narrator. Now, back to waiting for French's next installment..."
I usually don't read murder mysteries but am glad I checked out this one. It was so good!
"Very good author, good stories."
"I really liked this book, but didn't love it, and given some of her previous work I very much wanted to love it."
"Best mystery series out there. I've read them all, and this one was among my faves."
Enjoyed this book 
"The highlight of any Tana French book is the characterization, and French's building and eventual deconstruction of Antoinette Conway was excellent, maybe even her best yet. "
"A police procedural in a very foul squad room. It appears that the cops' ethics were really dark, but there was redemption in the end."
A solid Tana French book. 
"My second fave Tana French. Beautiful writing, nail biting and unexpected story, and gorgeously thought-provoking exploration of our motives for everything we do. RECOMMEND."
I wasn't as totally into this as I have been into some of her other books....but still really good.
Tana French hasn't disappointed yet. Looking forward to the next one.
Read some time ago but remember it as a well plotted police procedural investigation of a murder. thought she overdid it a bit on making her main character so hard nosed.
Thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the series! 
"I listened to this one. Loved it! Superb narration! I didn't know this was part of a series, but will look for more. I really liked how the story evolved."
I didn't enjoy the plot or characters very much. I prefer some of the other Dublin Murder Squad books and characters.
"Great story, well told."
Excellent story. Tana French never disappoints--plenty of plot twists and wonderful character development.
Tana French delivers again. My current favorite mystery writer.
Started with high expectations. Had a hard time getting engrossed until one third or more in. Appreciated the multi layers. Not my favorite of the 6 books. 3.5
"Probably a 4.5. I thought this was one of the better Tana French novels, though they're all good."
She's one of the best.
Stellar writing. Couldn't put this one down. (Plus it's fun to read all the dialogue full of Irish brogue.)
not my favorite in this series but still great
"This was a really great installment in the series. I didn't always love Antoinette, but the plot was fantastic. It was a great mystery, and it felt good to be with the murder squad once more. "
A mystery that keeps giving you surprise after surprise. It took me a while to warm up to the main character but loved her by the end.
Love this Irish detective series!
Another excellent police procedural from Tana French. 
Very good mystery told from the perspective of the lead detective on the case going into extreme detail of her thoughts and actions.
A great cop novel...
Fun and suspensfilled. I love the setting and Irish flair.
"Loved this! Awesome story, moving at a pretty slow pace which just makes the suspense even more... suspenseful. I was hooked from page 1!"
Made me want to back to Ireland. 
"So great finding a new author to follow

Great writing. The plot was thin regarding the victim's motives, but the rest was great . I recommend this book.
"
"Good. Not as good as the others, but good. Just a bit more predictable and staid than the rest of French's novels. "
"As always, this series is gripping and interesting till the end "
The best of the best. 
Newbie murder squad detectives are given a case to work at the end of their shift. Multiple barriers are thrown up at them and Antoinette has some problems o her own.
"A lot of swearing and it got kind of slow in the middle, but I enjoyed the characters and the plot a lot."
I really liked this book. Good build up to a great twist in the end.
"Another good one by Tana French. There were no ""fuzzy"" characters or endings, like In the Woods or Broken Harbor (my least favorite of her novels)."
Probably more like 4.5 stars!! 
"I give it 4 stars for this genre of murder detective. I enjoy the irreverent humor and the the Irish dialect and slang.Fun to figure out what she means, but."
I love Tana French's books but sometimes I get a little impatient with the heavy details.
"Another outstanding page-turner from Tana French

Back to the Dublin Murder Squad, this time with two newbie detectives who catch a case that has more spirals than a Slinky."
"Took a while to get in to, but once it got moving, it was great!"
"Good book!

Thought it was a good book and kept me guessing up until the end. A lot of details. Maybe it was too detailed. Still a pretty good read!"
"Slow start but it picks up, lots of ups and downs!"
"Long, but interesting! Two detectives are undeterred--find the cop who murdered a gal."
Stayed up late a few nights to read this thriller. Author does a good job of building tension and making you doubt the reliability of the narrator. 
"Another excellent read from this author. Good twists and turns, though the ending was a bit flat for me."
Excellent.
Really well paced and lots of interesting twists
