"The Trespasser is the sixth novel by Tana French and the sixth in her vivid, beguiling and compulsively thrilling ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series, which follows a contemporary Irish homicide investigation from the point of view a detective who played a supporting role in the previous book. Published in October 2016, this is the first novel whose publication date I've anticipated, reserving the first hold at my favorite library and racing over to pick it up like a zombie-eyed Black Friday shopper craving a markdown on an HDTV. No living author has a hold on me like French and her new novel--psychologically rich, sociopolitically charged and structurally brilliant--proves why.The story is told by Antoinette Conway, a thirty-two year old rising star promoted from Missing Persons into the elite Murder Squad operating out of Dublin Castle. A tenacious detective with solid interviewing skills--which her wholesome thirty-three year old partner Stephen Moran observed when she assisted him in locking down a girls' boarding school and interrogating eight separate teenagers in The Secret Place--Conway is prepared to resign. Her gaffer Superintendent O'Kelly slots the single Conway & Moran the thankless night shift cleaning up alco murders, while anonymous harassment from a person or persons on the squad keeps Conway watching her back.Handed a domestic violence case by O'Kelly at the end of their shift, Conway & Moran are dispatched to the scruffy neighborhood of Viking Gardens, where an anonymous call to Stoneybatter station alerted Garda to the body of twenty-six year old Aislinn Murray, dead from a skull fracture on the floor of her apartment. Moran's hopes that a serial killer might be on the loose are dashed by evidence Aislinn was preparing a romantic dinner at the time of her death; text messages indicate her date was Rory Fallon. Conway has seen Aislinn before but is unable to place where. She's also puzzled by their gaffer's order that she and Moran bring in vainglorious Detective Don Breslin, ""someone who's good with witnesses"" as backup.Domestics are mostly slam-dunks; the question isn't whether you can arrest your guy, or girl; it's whether you can build a case that'll hold up in court. A lot of people love that--it pretties up your solve rate, looks good to the brass--but not me: it means domestics get you fuck-all respect from the squad, where I could do with it, because everyone knows the solve came easy. Which is also another reason they piss me off: they've got a whole special level of idiotic all to themselves. You take out your wife or your husband or your Shag of the Day, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen? We're gonna be standing there with our mouths open, scratching our heads at the mind-blowing mystery of it all, Duh, I dunno, musta been the Mafia?  Surprise: we're gonna go straight for you, the evidence is gonna pile up way over your head, and you're gonna wind up with a life sentence. If you want to kill someone, have enough respect for my time to make it someone, anyone, other than the most gobsmackingly obvious person in the world.Conway & Moran keep Breslin in the dark long enough to have a crack at their first witness, Aislinn's best friend Lucy Riordian. Assuming the D's are there about Aislinn, Lucy maintains that while her friend hadn't known Rory long and was taking things slow with the bookstore owner, everything was fine between them. Aislinn's da vanished when she was a child and her mother, who did not take the separation well, recently passed away, liberating Aislinn to give her life a makeover. Lucy reveals that Aislinn had a habit of breaking dates, hinting that she might have had a fella before Rory, but claims she never confided who this man, if he existed, was.While Conway has no doubt that Rory Fallon is their man, Moran presents other theories. Aislinn Murray, who Conway refers to as ""dead Barbie,"" seemed to be putting her life together out of magazines. Her story remains a mystery, and while the D's agree that Lucy was holding something back, Conway doubts that this other fella existed. It strikes Moran that the call came in to a cop shop--not 999, where the calls are recorded--and while civilians wouldn't have known that, gangsters would've. However, when Breslin joins Conway to interview the cloying Rory Fallon at the squad room, their suspect leaves nearly half an hour in his evening unaccounted for and little doubt that he killed Aislinn.Conway feels pressure from Breslin to book Rory Fallon. Considering her enemy or enemies on the squad, it occurs to Conway that someone wants this case closed quickly. She discovers that one of the Murder D's ran a criminal background check on Aislinn Murray months before her death. Moran conjectures that if Aislinn's fella was a gangster, he might have a cop on his payroll, like Breslin or his miserable partner Joe McCann. Conway comes upon the men whispering about taking care of the woman and putting things back to normal, which might have been about Conway, or about McCann's estranged wife. Conway becomes aware of a tall dark stranger lurking around her house. She begins to doubt herself.My instincts are good--not bragging, every D's are, specially every D who makes it as far as Murder--and I know how to use them. They've come through for me when all the solid detective work in the world would have run me into a brick wall. But this time they're being bugger-all use. Not that they're out of commission--every sensor is firing wildly, red lights flashing, beeping noises everywhere--but they just keep sweeping, can't pin anything down. Rory's keeping something back, but I can't tell whether it's the murder or not; Breslin's fucking with us, but I can't figure out why. I feel like I'm missing the bleeding obvious here, but the harder I concentrate, the more all the signals turn to noise. Something is scrambling them.The Trespasser has the quality control that's been a staple of Tana French's work from the beginning and with this mesmerizing new entry, she proves again how complete an author she is. French's prose ratchets technical detail into a larger story incorporating the culture, geography and weather of modern Ireland. Her dialogue crackles with passion and wit, exploring one of my favorite sub-genres: the workplace drama. I don't know why, but I love reading about people going to work. The political content of French's books--not as in public policy, but the art and science of influence at any level--is bar none. She writes superlative interrogation scenes. And for French, relationships, whether friends, family or co-worker, are essential. The murder stuff is coincidental.French has employed a female homicide detective as narrator before (in the undercover themed The Likeness) but by setting The Trespasser predominantly in the office and surrounding Antoinette Conway with co-workers the detective doesn't trust, this novel more than any other is about the challenges warrior women may face in the workplace, waging a campaign on two fronts: against the enemy they can see as well as the saboteurs they cannot. Conway's past is largely kept submerged--a likely development for an author publishing her sixth novel as opposed to her first--but her fury is righteous, her angst is unmistakable and the novel is unputdownable. For readers unaccustomed to the riches of Tana French who are ready to dip their necks under the yellow tape, her ""series"" does not need to be read in any order due to each novel being narrated by a different character, as well as her commitment to start and end one story with each book. It is not necessary to commit to multiple books or purchases to get through one story. Here goes my ranking of the series from most favorite to least favorite. Keep in mind this is like ranking the six James Bond movies starring Sean Connery from most favorite to least favorite--there are no losers.1. Faithful Place (Dublin Murder Squad #3)2. In the Woods (Dublin Murder Squad #1)3. The Trespasser (Dublin Murder Squad #6)4. The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad #2)5. The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad #5)6. Broken Harbor (Dublin Murder Squad #4)"
"I've enjoyed all of Tana French's previous books, and I enjoyed this one, too! This book stars Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran, who were previously featured in The Secret Place. This time, Conway is the lead detective.

A young woman is found dead in her home. Evidence isn't really pointing in any particular direction. Conway and Moran come up with multiple theories, and it seems like they are being pushed toward one by a third detective, Breslin, who was also assigned to the case.

Conway is the only female in the Murder squad, and she is paranoid that the men are trying to make her quit. Except for Steve. He ""gets"" Conway. They are on the same wavelength. Steve is super with coming up with ideas and theories, and this drives Conway crazy sometimes, but she listens to him. I'm so glad there is not the slightest hint of romance between them!

There was a point in the book where I felt impatient with the investigation. I started to think things were becoming a bit improbable. It soon straightened out, and then I was in awe of Tana French's writing skills. Her characters are so real! The conclusion of the case was so sensitively written that I felt I was a fly on the wall. That lifted this book to 5 stars for me.

I think fans of Tana French will really enjoy this book. For anyone who hasn't read her books yet, pick up any one of them. The reading order doesn't matter because the lead detective is different in each book."
"Another smashing read from Tana French, The Trespasser is brilliant. It has the Murder Squad duo of Conway and Moran from The Secret Place back. Detective Conway is being worn to a frazzle by the hostility and cheap tricks she has to endure from the other detectives. They resent her, because she's tough as nails and doesn't go along with their harassment. It's made her an outsider in the only job she's ever loved. Sometimes, she even suspects her low-key partner Moran is in on the joke or wished he were.

The story of a young woman who's been brutally murdered is told through Conway's thoughts this time, instead of Moran's. This may be Conway's last case, if she leaves the Murder Squad. She wants a solve for this reason and because she won't accept anything else."
"Tana French’s The Trespasser follows Antoinette Conway, a jaded detective on the murder squad. After all the excitement of her initial job transplant, she’s dealt with near-constant racist and sexist harassment, and essentially only worked on basic domestic cases, which she and her partner Stephen close quickly and cleanly.

The death of Aislinn Murray at first seems like a clear cut case: she was preparing for a romantic dinner with a boyfriend, Rory, the likely suspect. The boyfriend, after all, is a common perpetrator. But as pressure from the squad builds up to close the case quickly, the two are forced to consider whether maybe, there’s something more going on here.

Antoinette Conway is such an interesting character to follow. She’s sarcastic and hard-edged, even more so than some previous members, but always sympathetic: she’s loving towards her partner and sympathetic towards people when they deserve it. Though she tries to cover up these bits of caring, even within her narration, they shine through; it’s easy to get invested in her relationships and personal struggles, hoping she’ll be given the chance to breathe out and also desperately hoping she’ll win, if only to prove them wrong.

Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway have my favorite detective pairing of the three Tana French novels I’ve read so far. His happy-go-lucky spirit contrasts perfectly with her more jaded attitude; they feel very Holmes-and-Watson-esque. Their final interrogation scene together, especially, is deeply satisfying and interesting.

Tana French’s writing is the definition of slow burn in the best way. Her red herrings are never quite out of left field; instead, they lead you in the wrong direction, but give you the information you need to find the right one. (I never succeed.) This specific mystery goes through so many excellent loops in such an interesting way. Aislinn Murray is a more interesting character than she seems, and discovering her origins kept me enthralled. I liked getting to know the victim just as I got to know the detectives fighting to save her.

Even though I initially rated this four stars, I keep flashing back to how much I loved the experience of reading this book; how enthralled it kept me, how close on the edge of my seat, how I didn’t guess the ending at all, how satisfying I found it. I’m bumping this up to five stars and will certainly be keeping it in my mind.

"This novel in the Tana French series about Irish murder detective Antoinette Conway is universally loved and considered among her best in a long line of terrific mystery novels. Why? There is little action in this novel. It is a novel of psychologies and pathologies.

The writing brings us deeply into the internal politics of a murder squad and expresses the difficulty of a woman operating in a rough environment hung with grisly soul-destroying murders. The male camaraderie inside the squad means that little concession is made for women with different histories, priorities, manners, and habits. Other women detectives Antoinette had known didn’t want to fight the scum-stain perps outside and their own colleagues inside. Antoinette is in the middle of making that very decision for herself during the period of the novel.

Antoinette is driven and bright, but she also has a chip on her shoulder that may lead her to attribute motives to colleagues inappropriately. Certainly she has been hazed by older detectives, so she has some cause for paranoia, but not everyone wants her to fail. In this novel she is chosen along with Stephen, a man everyone likes, to handle a case that looks straightforward…and turns out anything but.

French does the thought processes and conversation and hidden meanings so well that even from this distance we feel the cut of the sly put-downs and deflections, and the terror of facing very experienced actors in the interview rooms. The older male detectives in this novel reveal that they couldn't care less why a suspect might commit a crime, and are just happy to put someone down for the crime if it increases their solve-rate, whether or not it makes perfect sense.

Antoinette pursues the psychological in all her interviews. Cops conducting interviews must mask their feelings and intentions and the suspect must survive insinuation or barrage on their most closely held secrets. It is hurtful on both sides. One can only be steeped in slime for so long before it feels like it covers everything.

It’s French’s language that is so entrancing: her fresh insults and filthy descriptions of perps and coworkers stun us into laughter, making the old story of murder feel new. She also leads us astray several times, mentioning red herrings that we hang onto long past the time we should have jettisoned them.

Antoinette is able to twist us around her finger because we trust her vision. She can be cruel, dismissive, and suspicious but she goes after bad guys like a rottweiler. We'd want her on our side, but we wouldn't want her suspecting us of doing wrong. Readers convince themselves she is the honest and upstanding cop, unwilling to close ranks with male colleagues she doesn’t trust even as we begin to wonder if she isn’t being unreasonable. How can one person have so much going on inside? French almost loses our sympathy for Antoinette with her anger and admissions of her self-deceptions.

In this case, a young woman Aislinn has a makeover into a slim, slick magazine image of herself and ends up dead. The case has the appearance of an off-the-shelf “domestic.” Antoinette and Stephen initially feel disrespected when they are specifically chosen for the assignment, but their wide-open instincts turn up pieces that do not fit in a point-and-solve case.

One element of the story that left me feeling unsure was the thread that involved Antoinette’s father. A big piece of Antoinette’s identity involves her dark (what used to be called swarthy) skin and largish nose, presumably from her father’s side, and the notion of Antoinette as fatherless child who struggled with belonging.

Her father appears in this novel, and we are meant to notice his accent and clothes are high-tone British, and his facial features resemble his daughter's, but we get nothing of him as a person. French clearly left this thread for another day, but why introduce him at all? And why doesn’t the mere sight of him inspire a quenchless curiosity in Antoinette? He clearly wants to make contact, though in a queer and underhanded way. Is he a spook? Will French take Antoinette on a wider world tour in future novels and expand her reach into international intrigue? Is he the trespasser of the title? Or is the trespasser one on the squad?

I listened to the Penguin Audio production of this book, read by Hilda Fay. The Irish accents are the beauty of the listening experience, and I wouldn't have wanted to miss them. The fresh insults Antoinette thinks up to describe a person she disdains can be particularly toothsome in Irish brogue. And Fay does Breslin's greasy speaking style to perfection. Highly recommended.

A friend sent a link to a review in the NewYorker by Laura Miller, books and culture columnist for Slate."
"September 2020 Re-read: Short review for a book that has too much to talk about for me without writing a dissertation. I just find Antoinette Conway to be such an interesting narrator, and I love the way French plays off Conway's weaknesses with the murder of Aislinn Murray. I had actually forgotten almost everything about this book, except how thorny Conway was as a narrator, and how her paranoia 
ended up being mostly unjustified.

I had also forgotten how angry Conway made me in her contempt for other people showing what she views as weakness: desire to connect, showing emotions, needing other people. She is utterly dismissive of anyone who even shows a smidgen of vulnerability. What I like about French's execution of this character is that she doesn't learn some very special lesson. At the end of the book, she's still the same person, but her perspective has shifted a little. There's a great contrast between the boy's club atmosphere of the Murder Squad, and how insular it feels, and Conway's extreme insistence on independence.

There's a lot in here about how the stories we have in our heads affect the way we view other people, and situations. And then French takes that to another level when she ties it in with how the idea of how your actions can write somebody else's story, with what happened to Aislinn as a child, and with what she in turn did to 
Detective McCann.

Five star book is still five stars.

November 2016: It’s almost ridiculous how easy she makes it look, writing a book this good. I don’t even know what to say anymore about her books. They are all just so, so good. And the way she jumps from character to character each book gives her room to play around with different structures and themes, and yet still stay within the framework of a murder mystery novel.

I love murder mystery novels, but I don’t love these books because of the mysteries (although I don’t think her style would work as well in any other genre). I love them for the characters, and the way French writes her way into their heads. She makes them so human it hurts.

This one features Antoinette Conway, who we met last book. Conway is a hard lady to get to know, and she doesn’t make it easy for you to be in her head. She assumes the worst about people, and lets her own issues color her judgments of the victim whose murder she’s trying to solve. She’s also untrusting and contemptuous of people who show their vulnerability. It’s at times infuriating. But she’s good at her job, and she’s a fighter. It’s a fascinating portrait of a complex mind.

Ultimately, this is a book about how the stories we tell ourselves shape the way we see the world. It’s a theme that works ridiculously well in the context of a murder. The Trespasser isn’t my favorite of her books, others have hit harder and more deeply for me, but I can find no fault with it.

I waited too long to write this review, of course, so I’ve forgotten almost everything I had to say after finishing it two months ago. All that remains now is that I loved it, and I’ll be reading it again, and I can’t wait for the next book to be released in (hopefully, if she holds to pattern) 2018.

Initial pre-review January 2016: Hi. Hiiiiiiiiiii. Hello. Hello, my lovely. Soon we will be together."
"I am ashamed to admit that this is my first Tana French novel. I have heard and read such great things about her and so I jumped at the chance to read and review “The Trespasser”.

At 449 pages this is not a quick read, but at no time did I think there was any part of the story that should or could be shortened. Ms. French’s characters are very well described and I loved getting to know Antoinette Conway, the female detective in an otherwise male dominated department. She is the only detective that has made it to the Murder Squad. She and her partner Steve Moran are are an ideal match. He is everything that she isn’t; he’s happy to please people, he’s optimistic and idealistic and very smart, he also understand Antoinette very well, i.e. she always “must” be the driver, she can be verbally abusive but he knows how to deal with her and respect her.

Antoinette has been on the squad for two years and is sick of being harassed and given cases that require little skill. She has been thinking of resigning and finding a new profession. They are assigned to the Aislinn Murray case which at first seemed like another easy domestic violence case. The thought was that she was killed by her boyfriend, but when they start digging they start to create the person that Aislinn really was and the intrigue that she became involved in.

There are many other well developed characters; Antoinette’s best friend, Lucy who in the end is extremely helpful in solving the case, the experienced detective Breslin who is assigned to “help” them with the case; their superintendent O’Kelley who assigned them to the case and detective McCann best buddies with Breslin. All of these characters are well thought out in this intricately plotted police procedural.

I will not go through the plot of this novel, there are other reviews if you are interested in that, you can also read the blurb about the book.

What I liked best about this novel was it’s main character Antoinette Conway. We get to know her so well, back to when her mother never told her the truth about her father but instead invented stories from him being an Egyptian prince, a famous guitarist and even a medical student. She suffered from some aspects of her childhood and it’s one reason that drove her to become a police detective. She is extremely good at her job.

I will look forward to the next installment of the Dublin Murder Squad and I hope that you will pick up this great mystery/police procedural, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. The writing is great, the plotting is wonderful and the characters believable, flawed and well developed.

I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher.

I'M REPOSTING MY REVIEW BECAUSE THIS TALENTED AUTHOR HAS A NEW BOOK COMING OUT THIS FALL TITLED ""THE WITCH ELM"" SOUNDS GREAT, CHECK IT OUT :)"
"4.5 Rounded up.

This is the third Dublin Murder Squad novel I have read in as many week. I am addicted. I already have another one waiting. I am not reading them in the order in which they were written but in the order by which they become available from my library. What am I addicted to? The beautiful writing, the intelligence, the psychological accuracy , the authentic portrayal of people and relationships, including the ""guards"" on the murder squad who are dead-on believable, and the brilliant mystery and the twists and turns of the story.

This novel is bloody brilliant and my favorite of all the Dublin Murder Squad books."
"While i've enjoyed a few of Tana French's books before, I hadn't been blown away till I read this one. It is just so beautifully crafted that it must be considered part of the new, more literary crime fiction hitting the market right now. The first time you meet Antoinette Conway, you might doubt this. She's... how do I put it... real? Not afraid to speak her mind. A little bit of an attitude, maybe? But endlessly interesting and someone you want to work with to find out whodunnit, as a reader at least. French gets her character exactly right here, there's not a thought or action that jarred with who I pictured Conway to be, not a moment when I wasn't totally engrossed in the story she was telling me. Even if you haven't spent time with her before, by the end of this book you're going to know everything you need to about her, and the ways in which the events in this book have changed her. When it comes to Conway, French doesn't go for a subtle psychological profile, she screams it into your face, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for some moments of important self-reflection.

As for the tale she's telling, wow. A perfect blend of clever, exciting, and surprising. The seemingly simple domestic murder investigation against the backdrop of a murder squad deeply divided. Of course, the much more complex plot French put in place is quickly hinted and then developed. It is excellently done; even when new avenues are opened or evidence revealed, the reader is never quite sure where the truth lies. Not until right at the end. It's a tense read, that's for sure.

If you've never read Tana French before, you could certainly start here without any difficulty, or you could save the best for last. But either way, do read them. Where you start I'll leave up to you...


Many thanks to Tana French, Hodder & Stoughton, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review.

I love Antoinette Conway. She is a great detective and I love her attitude. She is a feminist and doesn't put up with any grief from the rest of the detectives. She has a temper that she fights to keep under control. She's assigned the shite cases, mostly domestics. And the latest case doesn't appear any different. In today’s world, it's easy to think women are accepted in any job they want. But as Antoinette has found out, there's a difference between being able to get a job and being accepted. Other than her partner, none of the other homicide detectives want her there. She deals with everything from missing paperwork to spit in her coffee.

And the writing is great. The description of the victim was great “she looks like Dead Barbie”. Or “Rory could be a full-on psychopath with more red flags than the a Chinese Embassy”. How can you not get a kick out of those kinds of descriptions?

It's always interesting to watch detectives put together possible scenarios, to see how their minds work. But French is positively brilliant about letting us see the “what ifs” and how the thought processes play out. Also in letting us see the interaction when different detectives have different ideas. Breslin is a piece of work. “I'm right back to wanting to throat punch the bollix. The fine thread of alliance that had built up between the two of us in the interview room lasted all of thirty seconds outside it.”

This is not a book who want their mysteries full of action. This is all about the mental processes. The book finishes with a great ending. Highly recommend.

"I loved this book.

Tana French has been my go-to author when I was stuck in a reading rut, and now that I've finished the latest novel in her Dublin Murder Squad series, I'm feeling a bit adrift. I was so caught up in the story of Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen that I didn't want ""The Trespasser"" to end.

Besides the actual murder case the pair are trying to solve — which had so many good twists and turns that I stayed up late to finish this book and find out what happened — I loved the relationship dynamics between the detectives, and watching how Antoinette dealt with the sexist jerks on the police squad who gave her a hard time. I've enjoyed all of French's books so far, but I think this one might be my favorite.

Highly recommended for fans of psychological thrillers and crime fiction."
Bumping up the rating to perfect 5. this was better on reread.
"I love Tana French; I love her Dublin Murder Squad series. Her latest, The Trespasser, might just be my favorite (although there’s fierce competition for that spot!).

Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the Murder Squad-and no one’s making her life easy. The other detectives, in fact, are doing everything they can to push her off the squad. And they’re close to succeeding. Conway is not an easy person-her father left before she was born and she and her mother have made their own way, despite many hardships. Conway is tough but the squad is getting to her. Then she lands a case of her own that may turn out to be big. A young woman found murdered in her home, maybe by her boyfriend but maybe, just maybe, by someone more important. Conway and her partner Steve Moran are investigating this possibility despite being heavily pushed by the higher ups to solve the case quickly.

The characters kept me breathless. I loved Conway, but I loved the other characters as well. All vividly real and as mysterious and difficult to know as real people are. The story is a good one but I’m a sucker for character-driven stories and this is one of the best. I wanted to slow down so I’d have the book with me longer but after a certain point, I just couldn’t stop myself.

A wonderful, wonderful book.
"
"Fair play to ye, Tana French. Fair. Play.

No interrogation scene in the history of interrogation scenes has anything on Tana French. Lt. Kaffee? May has well have been asking Colonel Jessup if he ordered a burger. Mr. Blonde? Clipping his fingernails. Verbal Kint? That annoying guy at the party you innocently ask about the weather and two hours later he's still talking. Sharon Stone? Got her doctor appointments mixed up again, bless her heart. Yawn.

While I'll always have a soft spot for In the Woods, this may be French's best work to date. I know; I'm basically a groupie at this point. Six books, 5 stars for each one. But I can't stop drinking the kool aid. Each of Tana's novels is a powerhouse of precision, thoughtfulness, passion, craft, etc., etc., etc., Each finds a new way to suck me in. Each makes me really feel. (Sometimes, uncomfortably so.)

It comes as no surprise that Tana’s next book, the already-hyped The Witch Elm, will be a departure from her Dublin Murder Squad series. Both French's fourth novel, Broken Harbour (the creepiest of the lot), and her fifth, The Secret Place, which flirts with the supernatural and unfolds impressively over the course of one day, hint at the author looking to flex her writing chops, and refusing to be pigeonholed into a one-note detective series. (Let's be clear, though: Nothing about the Dublin Murder Squad would ever really be considered ""one-note."" I'm merely stating that I appreciate her efforts to branch out.)

The Trespasser is French’s biggest departure thus far. The novel is narrated by Antoinette Conway, who was featured heavily in Book 5, as then-narrator Stephen Moran’s partner. But while Conway now has her turn at the helm, this is a “partner” book, through and through: you get glimpses of what makes Conway tick and glimpses of what makes Moran tick. But there’s never that shining trademark spotlight on Conway. In some ways, given what we learn motivates Conway—the case, the work, the facts—it’s no surprise: Screw introspection, the past, the future, friends, personal life, not to mention help of any kind; let’s fucking solve this fucker and be done with it.

The importance of sticking to the facts and solving this fucker means that this book is also about 90 percent dialogue. Which made for slow-going initially, slogging through police procedural (the murder of a young, pretty blonde in her home, next to a dining room table set for two), the gathering of evidence, and interviews that often turn up diddlysquat. But the dialogue builds so beautifully and intensely, with interrogations getting more and more exhilarating as the duo hones in on the killer, the payoff—oh, the payoff—is nothing short of earth-shattering."
"Tana French, I love everything you do! 5 magnificent stars, this may be my favorite of hers yet. From the get go, the setting and the mood are in evidence. This author's descriptive writing is unsurpassed, in my opinion. I wanted to provide some sample quotes here, but to illustrate the full impact of her pages would require several long paragraphs. And I don't think my words alone can do this book justice.

Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the Murder Squad and still somewhat of a rookie besides, so she and her equally young partner Steve feel like they're under constant scrutiny to prove their worth as detectives (Ds). Conway is guarded, introspective, and on edge, ready to explode, while Steve is a ""chirpy little bollix."" They play off each other like seasoned pros. They're handed a case that the other Ds say is a slam dunk, but their senses tell them something is off and someone wants this solved a little too quickly.

Much of the plot progresses via the smart dialogue, and like no one else, French gives us not just their words but also every little eye twitter, mouth twitch, and nervous jitter so that we feel like we are there seeing the action, feeling the tension, and not just reading it. I was on the edge of my seat throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments to lighten the load at times. In the end, there is no one else in the same league as French.
"
"This is Literary fiction wrapped in a mystery. This is not a ""genre"" novel (though it is a murder mystery :-D ). It is by far her best work up to this point. And the writing is amazing. I will miss every character in this book. :-)"
"The problem with writing a review for a book just after I devour it (when it’s this good, that is) is that I still have that reading high that makes it impossible for me to write something substantive, to be evaluative. All I want to do is flail my hands about like a goon and gush praise and sparkles. I feel like one of those cartoon characters with hearts for eyes. The awe is cumulative at this point; each successive book impresses me more, and unlike some books, the sparkle doesn’t wear off, either.

So I’d tell you take everything I say about The Trespasser with a grain of salt, because I loved it, of course, but that would be a crazy thing for me to say, because I LOVED IT OF COURSE AND YOU SHOULD TOO.

“The stuff people think I should try to hide--being tall, being a woman, being half whatever--is the stuff I keep up front and in their faces. If they can’t handle it, I can use that.”

Meet Antoinette Conway, the only female Murder D on the squad for the last two years. Conway is judgemental and prickly and guarded (although her typical idea of defense is to attack first), and she’s under a lot of stress. Murder Squad hasn’t been the synergistic experience she’d wanted: aside from her amiable partner, Stephen Moran, she doesn’t have any allies on the force. Whether it’s because she’s female or non-white, she can’t so much as leave her drink unattended on her desk without returning to find it seasoned with spit. If it was merely personal, she’d deal, but her cases are being sabotaged, too.

Conway is not a sentimentalist, not a wishful thinker. She spends a lot of time in this book calling out others for their fanciful daydreams, their “what ifs”, their “if onlys”, and disparaging them for not accepting reality. Really, she’s angry at people for not taking ownership of their own stories, for letting other people dictate it or influence it, and that includes herself.


[The people walking past] make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.


The difficulty of believing or not believing in someone’s “story” is a huge part of this novel. Really, it’s a huge part of every mystery and every Tana French novel, but it’s more overt in Conway’s narrative. People lie to each other, but also to themselves, and when you’re in so close and tight with one person--like we are in reading Conway’s story--you can’t always tell the difference. She distrusts all of the other characters and, as her paranoia increases due to her toxic work environment, she distrusts herself as well, but she still behaves outwardly as if she’s certain. Her interactions with others--whether she’s attacking or barricading herself in--are all based on the story she’s telling herself, putting herself at the center of a vast conspiracy in the Murder Squad.

Still, it’s not certain that she’s NOT the center of a vast conspiracy, and that’s why this novel is so intense and suspenseful. You’re not sure what’s going on with her and her co-workers, and as Conway’s dread builds, everything starts to feel significant and ominous. Conway and Moran work their new case, the murder of a young woman that looks like a clear-cut domestic, with increasing suspicion of the obvious, easy suspect (the boyfriend) because of how weirdly invested everyone else on the squad seems to be in closing the case fast. I spent a lot of this book cringing in anticipation of humiliation or violence or a career-ruining moment for Conway and/or Moran, and it was both terrible and wonderful. If it was a TV show, I would have been hiding behind the couch.

The difficulty of sifting fact out of fiction also makes for some riveting interrogation scenes, especially in the last 100 pages or so, when the momentum speeds up like a drop from a rollercoaster. I’m so impressed that these interrogation scenes, which feature pages after pages of nothing but people sitting in a room and talking, are so tense and yet so subtle and intricate. It could be boring; it could be endless exposition. Instead, French gives all her characters such psychological depth that these scenes play out like master chess games. I love how French always makes her detective-narrators seem like supernatural mind readers 
until it turns out that they’ve misunderstood everything, of course - again, the benefit of such a tight perspective. In the past, Conway and Moran both idolized Murder Squad detectives for their superhuman ability to outmaneuver the “cunning psychos”, and they’re often presented in a similar light to the reader 
again, until they slip up.

French’s novels are always thematically rich, with a lot to unpack, but it’s about the characters for me, and their relationships with each other. Conway and Moran are the Detective OTP of my dreams. 
While French's novels always leave with something irrevocable and sad or bittersweet, at least this time she’s preserved the union at the heart of the story: Conway and Moran, who made me fall in love with The Secret Place, who work so well together and have such unacknowledged faith in each other that even when fighting, they have each other’s backs.

Read it and sparkle on."
"And once again I'm a little lost for words. I finished this days ago, ate it up in one sitting, refused to talk to anyone (and snarled at all those poor unfortunates who tried to engage me in any way) until I had reached the very last page. So... it was an amazing read, right?

Well, yes. But all I can think since finishing it is that it isn't as good as her best. Because Tana French at her best is some adjective on the far side of incredible, and for me The Trespasser never quite reached those lofty heights.

I think it really does come down to personality and personal taste. My favourite Tana French book may not be yours, but that doesn't really mean much to be honest. I loved the eerie, floaty, summer-high feeling in both The Likeness and The Secret Place, and the harsher streets in Faithful Place drew me in just as strongly. The lead characters in those books were all engaging, in different ways, but Conway's forced bluntness never quite sat right with me. Everything felt a little more obvious than needed, from the main mystery at hand to Conway's ongoing battle with the rest of the Murder squad. I don't need likeable to be the main trait of a narrator, but if you are going to sit with them and listen to their thoughts for 500 pages you have to relate to them at least a little. I didn't really enjoy being inside Conway's mind, and even French's truly stellar writing never quite made up for that.

But shit, she can write and (as I've said before) even her worst is streets ahead of most other writers. I couldn't even call this her worst; The Trespasser is a very good book - just not my favourite, by far.

Notes on a second reading

I take all it back. Five stars to you again, Tana French, you pure and utter genius. It took a second time reading but this one caught me (still not as much as my favourites by her but enough).

Before reading:

YES!!

YES!!

new book is happening!

I need this in my life. I need it now.

I don't think I've felt this impatient for a book since the last Harry Potter came out..."
"While I'm reading a book I may stop and ask myself where I think it's falling star-rating-wise. I'm a reviewer, it's part of the job, right? Tana French is tricky because she's always so solid that I need to get a little more critical. I'm basically her ideal reader and the Dublin Murder Squad series is basically my ideal series. This time around I started wondering if I should re-read the whole thing and rank them, I've been thinking about where to start, and how to deal with the classic IN THE WOODS vs. THE LIKENESS divide. I have yet to complete that re-read, but for now I have to say that THE TRESPASSER is currently in my #2 slot. (Behind IN THE WOODS because I'm on that side of the divide.)

There's a lot about it that would obviously appeal to me. Female detective, strong personality, great voice. But there's a lot of the perfect procedural here, too. A story where the detective and the victim have parallels in their lives, a sub-plot where the detective isn't just fighting to solve the case but is fighting against a larger foe, a twisty-turny plot that throws enough twists at you to keep pages turning but earns them, and (thankfully) a take-no-shit detective who doesn't have that tired worn-out trope feel that often happens in cop novels. As I was reading I was thinking, ""I think this is 5 stars. I think it is. Don't mess it up."" As you can see from my rating, the book delivered.

Conway was exactly who I needed. I was hoping she'd be the center of this book since reading THE SECRET PLACE. Like all of French's protagonists, the case is just as much about her journey as it is about solving the case. Getting inside her head, it's nice to see the prickly demeanor isn't just an act, it's nice to see where it comes from and to feel her out in more detail. And I'm anxious to re-read THE SECRET PLACE to see her relationship with Moran from his perspective. It's common with the Dublin Murder Squad novels for a detective to disappear after you get attached to them (WHERE ARE ROB AND CASSIE???) so this was a nice change.

I saw someone worry while reading this that they'd solved a key plot point too early. I had the exact same experience. We were both wrong. It's beautifully laid out, plenty of pieces to put together, meticulously plotted as always. If Tana French writes Dublin Murder Squad books forever, I would be okay with that. Though I admit, I would also be happy if they were all Conway books going forward."
"I’m a huge fan of Tana French – for me she sits up there with King as the author I look to for the reads that just drag me under.The Dublin Murder Squad series has been an absolute delight and an absolutely killer set of reads and The Tresspasser just adds into that.

I love how the characters flow during the series, often a drop in character from the previous novel becomes the focus for the next – in The Tresspasser two of my favourites return in the form of Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, now working together on the squad and facing a daunting task in their hunt for a killer.

This is literary crime right at the top of the tree for me – beautifully written, beautifully plotted, stunning character depth and just such a page turner, could not put this down for the LIFE of me. The relationship between Antoinette and Stephen is fascinating, complex and built beautifully throughout the story, interwoven with the mystery element, the current case, which is as twisty as they come. The Trespasser is a perfect storm of a story, combining drama, unpredictable turns, unlikely hero’s and divisive characters both good guy and bad. So very very compelling all the way.

Loved it. The entire series is highly recommended by me."
"Back in my 20's, when first tossed into the professional world, I wondered why my natural brilliance < /sarcasm> failed to be noticed by my bosses, and why I wasn't rising faster in the ranks. I rather quickly realized that there was a significant percentage among my peers who were a whole lot smarter than me. I was somewhat puzzled to see that they weren't rocketing to the top, either.

Now, with many years of techie hindsight to look back on, I realize that the single best predictor of professional ascent is determination. (This is hardly an original thought -- there are entire shelves full of books and studies linking grit and resilience to success.) And Antoinette Conway, the hero of this book, is the most determined character I've ever met in literature. We look on, thunderstruck, as Detective Conway, pinned to the mat, wriggles free once more and rises for another round.

Many of us spend much of our lives obeying somebody else's rules, and have made peace with this in return for stability, predictability, comfort. We may occasionally cast mental glances into the top floors of the HQ building, wondering what the lives of the resident silverbacks are like, these unknown individuals who possess so much power over our lives. And in some moods, we may hope that their powers and riches do not bring them happiness and fulfillment.

Fear not. Those individuals who, like Detective Conway, comprise the top 1% of the top 1% of the Determination spectrum are not happy people. The champion mentality, which requires casting all sense of proportion, much self-knowledge and a simple family live overboard, rarely produces happy people. So vast is the difference between Conway's thought processes and mine that it's like I'm learning a whole new language, and like being dropped into a new culture, it's both exhausting and animating. I was reminded of Hank Palace of Ben Winter's Last Policeman trilogy, another narrator who simply couldn't let something go. I don't know whether to cheer for these people or have them committed, but the fact is that these are the elect, by and large, the ones who rule our world.

It's fun to get inside the head of somebody like this, and Tana French has done a stunning job of it. I was lead to this book by a review and another review which made it sound too good to pass up. My reaction to this was quite different, but we can all agree that French is a masterful portraitist, and Conway a wonderful subject for her attention.

My overwhelming desire right now is to fly back to Dublin and check out all the neighborhoods and locations mentioned in the book -- at this moment, they feel like half-siblings that I've recently become aware of but never met.

Anybody who's read this far will notice that I haven't mentioned the plot. The plot, while tight, doesn't matter. This is, first, a journey into January Dublin, and even more than that, a journey into the foreign world of Antoinette Conway's mind. Whether she's chasing murderers or Moby Dick's whale is almost irrelevant.
================================================
(Written at the beginning of Chapter 6):

Sometimes text just lies there, dead on the page. In other writers' hands, it stands up and sings. This is how Chapter 6 of this addictively readable tale begins:


Me and Steve head for the car pool and our shitty Kadett. The web of laneways behind Dublin Castle is hopping: students dragging their hangovers towards Trinity College, business types talking too loud into too-big phones so we can all be blown away by their Bulgarian property deals, yummy mummies out for shopping sprees and skangers out for pickings. It feels good getting out onto the street, where any danger coming our way won't be personal, and I hate that...

...""For the interviews,"" Steve says, sidestepping a couple having complicated relationship problems in Russian, ""or for whatever else he's doing. Not long before you got in, right? Breslin's mobile rang. He had a look and got this face on him--"" Steve does a clamped jaw and flared nostrils: Breslin, pissed off and trying to cover it."
Another whopper as usual. How does this woman do it? I finished this on Sunday & I'm still raw. WHAT AN ENDING.
"The Dublin Murder Squad series is unforgettable. Crisp, sharp, and soaked in Irish charm, every one of these books will sweep you off your feet. Even if you're not a fan of the detective genre, top notch writing qualifies these novels as stand alone fiction.

This latest story is told by Antoinette Conway, the only female detective on the team. Two years in and dark, stoic, ""token"" Antoinette is just as unwelcome as she was on day one. When a pretty young girl turns up dead in her home, it looks like a lovers' spat gone wrong. At first glance, the case is nothing special, but it proves to be the sink or swim turning point of Conway's career.

This book has all the magic of its predecessors plus it's fascinating to see the squad through Antoinette's eyes. Like anyone who's ever been on the outside looking in, her grit and determination come with generous helpings of loneliness and paranoia.

I sincerely hope Tana French is hard at work on the next installment of this series.🤞🏻Excuse me while I find something else to do with my life in the meantime ..."
"Well, if that's the end of the series, it pretty much meets the standard for icing on the cake (and a cherry on top). I really enjoyed this one and, in retrospect, it may have been my favorite. Once I started it, I struggled to put it down ... and I stayed up far too late one evening (or into the next morning), because, well....

While I have no aversion to serial reading (and I keep a running list of serial sci-fi, fantasy, and action stuff for travelling, sitting in long metal tubes (planes & trains), etc.) .... I'm not a classic cop/detective, mystery, or adventure reader, ... then again, I typically have Jack Reacher (lowest common denominator drifter adventure/cop/detective shoot-em-up) or Gabriel Allon (international intrigue, Euro-heavy travelogue, with a heavy dose of Middle East terrorist tension) ... or both pre-loaded on my Kindle when I hit the road, but, at home, I do read more than my fair share of stuff that could fall into more closely related genres, ranging from, I'd say ... Nesbo's Harry Hole, a fine example of European noir detective/action/thriller .... to James Lee Burke's various domestic (Louisiana, Texas, etc.) cop/detective/lawyer books, which are far more literary than most. French is hard to pigeon-hole, but I appreciate that her stuff is more finely crafted than most....

I read the six Dublin Murder Squad books in order, albeit slowly (over a number of years). As much as I enjoyed them, I find them wearing, exhausting, stressful, depressing, dark, heavy ... and, well, you get the idea, ... and so I've rarely rushed back to grab the next one, yet ... I've also never considered not plowing through to the end (if, indeed, this is the end).

My bottom line is that French is very good at what she does, and she earns top marks for intensity, complexity, and creativity in terms of plots ... special honors for her prose and lyricism (which often seems jarring given the subject matter) ... and my unrestrained respect and adulation for making her characters (protagonists, villains, sidekicks, bit players, relatives, roadkill, window dressing, red herrings) real and vibrant and animated and compelling and flawed and, ultimately, convincing.

It's hard not to read the six books and have favorites (and, of course, the opposite) among the Murder Squad crew.... Similarly, the plot lines ... and the victims ... and the settings ... vary, and some resonate more than others. For whatever reason, this package all worked well for me, and, by and large, the narrator's voice rang true.

Unlike many serial books, I agree with those who suggest that these need not be read in order. (As a general rule, I'm a strong proponent of consuming books in order, but I don't sense that's critical with these.) Frankly, while they're related, they don't feel sequential (to me), and I can't think of many instances where prior-book learning curves or foundational facts/premises were particularly important.

At some point, I may experiment with French's standalones, but for now, I'm glad I found French, and I'm satisfied with the books - individually and collectively."

   Amongst Her Best Work - 5 Stars 
While Tana French's previous installment,  The Secret Place  was a bit of a miss by her high standards, Tana French has a sound ""hit"" with her latest installment.  The Trespasser  is a return to the magnificent character novel for which she is best known. The Plot The story follows Antoinette Conway and Stephan Moran subsequent to their investigation from the previous novel. In what has become a trend, Antoinette and Stephan are given a seemingly mindless and straightforward murder case. To make matters worse, Breslin, a senior detective, is put on their team. Breslin seems to be part babysitter and part ""backseat"" detective as he tries to steer the investigation toward conclusion. As is usual in a Tana French novel, nothing is as trivial as it initially appears and the detectives are left to question how their moves in the investigation will protect or undermine their future. My Take After  Faithful Place , I was on a Tana French high. Each novel had improved and she started fusing her magnificent character building and with an excellent plot. Her subsequent novels did not reach the same heights and her last installment was a rare miss. I started this novel with a bit of trepidation. Thankfully, this latest installment brings the series back on track and she once again combines spectacular character development with an excellent plot.In  The Trespasser , we may have the most unlikeable protagonist to date paired with the hard to dislike Stephan Moran. Faced with a rather toxic work environment, Antoinette is wracked with self doubt a general mistrust of her co-workers. Initially, this made for a difficult read. As a reader, it was difficult to connect with her and difficult to understand her motivation. This is where the mastery of Tana French came into play. Whether or not you were able to connect with Antoinette, you came to understand her. For my money, this is the greatest feat a writer can accomplish.In most of French's novels, the plot is generally a weak point. As far as my personal taste is concerned, if I am reading a masterful character novel, the plot becomes a non-issue. I have noted that Tana has sought to improve the plot within her stories. While she did so in her previous novel, the balance between plot and character was not quite right. In  The Trespasser , she found the proper combination. While this is still a character novel by all accounts, the plot plays a far more prominent role. Final Thoughts The noted growth in the author's writing marks this as one of her best to date. I will leave you to make the determination if it is better than the rest. Regardless, everything you love about Tana French is in  The Trespasser  and it was well worth the wait."
"4.5, rounded up

I love Tana French. Her books are consistent favorites and this one is not an exception. I loved everything about it and think it's one of her best. In this installment of the series, the main character from the Murder Squad is Antoinette Conway. She’s a tough cookie and, due to a complicated past and harassment from male colleagues, has a huge chip on her shoulder and feels like an outsider among her own team. She’s not always likable but I do love a dysfunctional character.

The story starts out when Antoinette and her partner Steve are called to the scene of the murder of a young woman. All signs point to the victim’s boyfriend, but soon the case turns out to be anything but routine.

As with all of Tana French’s books, this is part police procedural and part character study. Antoinette is tough as nails on the outside – snappy, sarcastic, and whip smart - but, through her inner dialogue, we find out she’s much more complicated. The dynamic she has with her partner Steve was fabulous and along the way Antoinette grows and discovers aspects about herself which come as a surprise to her.

The writing is excellent and the dialogue is witty and clever, but realistic. This is not a fast-paced thriller but the inner workings of how an investigation is handled and how suspects are interrogated was fascinating. The case was complicated with enough tension and twists to keep things interesting and it was resolved satisfactorily.

I highly recommend the audio - the narrator was Irish and was perfect."
"Every time I begin a new French book I make sure to clear everything I have on my to-do and make sure no one's going to interrupt me, because I know I'm going to spend the evening hanging on to her every word. And after I put down the book I spent last night in bed tossing and turning and thinking about Antoinette Conway and her antagonistic attitude, her reluctant friendship with her partner, Steve Moran, and the piss in her locker all over her interview notes. French writes people, not ideas or plots. She writes about how the duo stumbles their way through what seems like an open-and-shut DV case, throwing big daydreams about gangs and conspiracies because they don't want to think about how their gaffer, O'Kelly, gives them easy cases because they suck, and the plot moves with them. Some writers write plots and stick in characters where the plot requires; they have different names but Frank can easily replace Lanny; the women are love interests and Sarah can easily replace Jane. But in French's novels, many of the plot points and little nudges and resolutions happen because of the character. She uses all that she can possibly harvest from a character - her womanhood, her sad childhood and missing da, her cynical, judgmental personality, her need to regain control over her career - to move the plot. If Conway had never been subjected to relentless sexist harassment from her colleagues, if she had not been pranked and had her investigations sabotaged, she might not have gritted her teeth and dug deep and against the squad into where she knew she shouldn't, to turn her easy, boyfriend-hits-girlfriend manslaughter case into a hard but satisfying solve. That's all I have to say for French. Her characters jump out of the page and stayed with me, and I cheered for, or cried with, or pitied all of them, even the murderer, because she weaves beautiful stories from them that we can all relate to. And they stay with you for a while.


“What’s left underneath is smaller than either of those, quieter and more complicated, done in finer detail. Roche, begging for a punch in the gob, which is high on my to-do list. The lads, each of them deep in his own mix of dodgy alibis and messy fiber evidence and the baby’s chicken pox, occasionally glancing up to roll their eyes at Roche’s bullshit or mine. The gaffer—it occurs to me that just maybe the gaffer throws the odd domestic our way, not because they piss me off, but because they have a good clearance rate and he wants our stats solid; or maybe, even simpler, because he knows we’ll work the hell out of them. All of them, and Steve. And me.”"
"Nothing in crime fiction quite compares with the 6 books comprising Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series. Each book has a different focus, a somewhat different sensibility; if I recall correctly, each is set in a different district of Dublin and the surrounding area. And although more than one detective may carry over from book to book, French focuses her intense attentions on only one per volume.

In this case it’s Antoinette Conway, the only woman currently on the Squad, the subject of much harassment, and nearing the end of her ability to deal with it. She’s whip smart and strong willed and holding it together only because she is teamed with Steve Moran, a young detective brought onto the squad at her recommendation and seemingly willing to work with her.

As always with this series, the writing is brilliant: crisp, believable dialog; incisive character studies; clever plotting. Women readers may find it easier than men to identify with Antoinette’s frustration and confusion over her work environment, but the many-layered story should appeal to anyone who appreciates a police procedural that produces far more than what that genre typically has to offer.

From what I can tell based on reviews, there is no consensus as to which book in the series is best. Just yesterday, as I was about to mention to a friend that I was probably least fond of The Secret Place, she announced that it was her favorite. As I said, no consensus.

While I probably enjoyed The Likeness the most overall, I loved the ending of In the Woods best. I still do, although the conclusion of this book runs a close second as it presents a sort of acceptable closure for the series. Which is actually a shame.

"
6 out of five stars! I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept my attention way through to the end. It was realistically written but Tana French also played a little with the reader's mind. I wonder what my bookfriends will think of it. Her best book so far for me.
"HER BEST ONE YET

Maybe I'll write up more later but isn't that all I really need to say???

(Thanks to Penguin for the galley!)"
"Tana French, you did it yet again. Here I stand (I actually sit, but nvrmnd), full of awe and admiration for your piercing writing skills and for the treasure you hide for us to find at the darkest hour of the night, deep in the black forest of your brilliant creation. When reading, one have to be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions, suspicions, desperation, disbelief, spiritual ups and downs. In one word - the Tana French Feels.
Three words actually, oops.
If you're here for a clean and strict police procedural - do yourself a favour and look elsewhere. Although the procedural is also here and it's good too.

The basic drive of French's stories are her protagonists and their inner monologues. This time we're in the head of Antoinette Conway, mean (amirite?) and badass detective on the scene for the second time after the The Secret Place. Here's also Steve Moran, who we meet for the third time (first time in Broken Harbour, probably my favourite so far, together with In the Woods). Stevie is my fav so far, although he's a very poker face-y player, in my opinion, no matter how ""cute"" he comes to be... God knows if we will get to meet him someday again, but I'm cheering for him.
The crime is again seemingly quite simple, but as always messy and ambiguous in so many ways, as we discover very early after our detectives start digging. It's thrilling, it's unsettling too.

And like I said before, seeing everything through Antoinette's eyes and processed by her brain gives a strange taste of bad coffee, dissatisfaction, adrenaline and constant danger. She's trouble and she's looking for trouble and she drives the whole case like a bulldozer driven by suppressed rage, personal feelings and certain negativity, fighting some ghosts from her own past (aren't they all at the House French?). I'll confess - I didn't like to be in her head, but I do admire her as a cop.

I really would love to share some more, but that would definitely be much spoiling and I'm not like that. If you're into French you will find out for yourself and then we can discuss.
If you're not into French - this book won't make you like her more. Please go.

Much love and definitely 5 stars for this one."
"You gotta love a Tana French novel. At least, I do! I turned my colleague Caroline on to them years ago, and we have finally caught up to the end of the Dublin Murder Squad series. What are we supposed to do with ourselves now?!

I had loved the rough pairing of Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran in “The Secret Place”, which was such a weird but entrancing novel; the possibility of seeing them work together again was delightful, and I was so pleased to get a chance to curl up with “The Trespasser”, at last!

Conway and Moran are called to a crime scene that seems to be a classic case of domestic violence gone wrong: a young and pretty girl took a punch and hit her head on the edge of the fireplace in her picture-perfect flat. A new boyfriend was supposed to join her for dinner, but he claims she never opened the door. This should be a slam-dunk, but the more they scratch at the crime scene and the victim’s past, the less Aislinn Murray turns out to be the insipid pretty girl she was assumed to be, and the weirder things get. The fact that the brass is putting a lot of pressure on Conway and Moran to just arrest the boyfriend and call it also raises a few red flags for Antoinette, who is quite used to being treated like the squad’s pariah.

The focus of this book is really about feeling alienated, and I suppose that while all the Dublin Murder Squad novels toyed with that idea on one level or another, Conway is the one who has the most concrete experience of being an outcast. She is the only woman detective in an all-male squad, she gives no quarters, doesn’t try to be pleasant simply for the sake of being liked, and her default setting is angry and cynical. Their victim was also someone who for a very long time, struggled with fitting in. But as one can expect from a Tana French book, nothing is quite as simple as it seems, and the more we learn about Aislinn, the more crushed I felt by the strange fate that befell her. Her and Antoinette are, rather oddly, two sides of the same coin: women who had to make themselves up from scratch, though they went about it in wildly different ways.

Those books are never really about finding the culprit, and always about why the victim ended up dead, and while they are always crushing, this tragedy had me in pieces. “The Trespasser” takes the idea of romance gone wrong to another, super fucked up level. I always wrap up those books with a lump in my throat and a craving for a stiff drink, and I was not disappointed this time. I’m going to go get a large scotch and mourn the end of this wonderful series."
"My first Tana French novel, but definitely not my last. In addition to being excellent, the audio version is voiced beautifully by Hilda Fay, who is also new to me; her interpretation is outstanding, and the thick Irish accent makes it still more engaging.

I listen to audio books when I use my stationary bike. My rule for myself is that if I stop cycling before the time I have set for myself, I also have to turn off the audio book early; on the other hand, if I complete my assigned time, I allow myself to continue listening while I prepare dinner. With this book I didn't stop early even once, because I couldn't stand to quit listening.

Our protagonist, Detective Antoinette Conway, is a character from The Dublin Murder Squad, and I have read none of these. If I had had the entire series in front of me, I'd have begun with the first, but as it was I had only this one, and I had no problem keeping up with it. Perhaps if I had the insights into character that come with a longer series, it would have been even richer; in this one Conway is experiencing burnout of the first order as well as fed up with the sexual harassment that women cops deal with. An old friend has offered her a job as a bodyguard to celebrities; the fact that she is dark-skinned and female would actually count in her favor there. And she is seriously considering it, especially after she and her partner Steve are saddled with what appears to be just one more cut-and-dried case of murder-by-boyfriend. But of course, all is not as it seems.

There's one aspect of the solution that has been used many times by other writers, but here it is fresher because of the writer's voice and skill. However, there are a couple of curves that are also included--no spoilers--that are a complete surprise and yet also entirely credible.

Goodreads friends recommended this writer and her DMS series to me years ago, and I told myself I'd get around to it. I cannot believe I waited this long. Tana French is on my list of authors now, and although I have heard that this book is her best, I want to go back and read her earlier work too, because I have a hunch that French's second best, third best and so forth are likely to shine brighter than the best produced by a number of other crime writers.

Highly recommended, especially with St. Patrick's Day right around the corner."
"This is the sixth instalment in the Dublin Murder Squad series, and this one by Detective Antoinette Conway, who is battling sabotage, pranks and press tipping by her fellow detectives, all male, to establish herself. She and her partner Stephen Moran are assigned a case where a woman (Aislinn Murray) is brutally killed in her own home, and it appears the culprit is her new beau, a seemingly meek bookshop owner. Their investigation moves beyond circumstantial evidence, and there are many twists and turns along the way. Detective Conway and victim Murray each have some family problems, creating tension in their lives. This is a well-crafted police procedural full of suspense and mystery; the downsides are it is slow is some spots, perhaps mirroring how police work actually progresses, and the Irish slang is sometimes hard to decipher."
"“Time after time it’s left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads”.


I have foolishly devoured four titles in the Dublin Murder Squad series in one big greedy binge and now realise that I will soon run out of my regular fix, unless Tana French increases her rate of production.
This instalment has a lot of scenes in the interrogation room, which I especially enjoy, with the cut and thrust of psychological manoeuvres between suspect and detectives.
Ms French is so adept at constructing a convincing plot outline in all the criminal investigations she describes, so that the reader happily suspends their disbelief, even at the most unlikely of scenario."
The Dublin Murder Squad is absolutely my favorite detective series ever and I hope Tana French never stops writing about them. This one was one of my favorites in the series. Conway is just awesome and I think French is at her best when she writes female characters. I just love all the details and the richness of her writing. 
Reading Tana French is a treat! I have loved all of her books. Broken Harbor was my favorite so far and this is right up there. Already looking forward to her next book.
I just love these Murder Squad books by Tana French! They are wonderful psychological mysteries where all the characters are very complex.
"Now I know why karen refers to Tana Fucking French. The Trespasser works as a suspenseful police procedural and as a brilliant exploration of the role narratives play in crafting and distorting our individual realities.

Detective Antoinette Conway (who readers who are smarter than I am will have met in The Secret Place) is tough and bitter, difficult and brilliant. How much is her sense of being hunted and persecuted by the other members of the Dublin Murder Squad is real and how much is a paranoid fantasy? Does looking for ulterior motives hinder her capacity to effectively look into the killing of a young woman who has been killed, apparently by her boyfriend? How did the victim fabricate stories that led her to final moments? How much are Antoinette's fellow detectives crafting their own versions of reality and are they doing it to mislead the investigation or for reasons of their own?

Detective fiction, no let me be a bit hyperbolic here, literary fiction rarely gets better than this. The Trespasser is simultaneously suspenseful and contemplative, exciting and heart breaking.

Oh yes, I've got five earlier French novels I've been meaning to read. I feel like an idiot not having read them given how fabulous they are reputed to be, but now I'm glad they are waiting for me. I can only hope that by the time I work my way through them, there may be another Tana Fucking French novel, or even possibly another season of Happy Valley on the horizon. Nah, I'll read them too fast (plus I'll blow through Megan Abbott's new book) and then I'll be bereft for a couple of years. Damn."
"There is no better thriller writer than Tana French. That is not hyperbole. She's the gold standard. The Trespasser is the sixth book in her Dublin Murder Squad series, but the good news is they each work just fine as a standalone. In this outing, Detective Antoinette Conway is investigating what looks like an open-and-shut domestic case along with her trusty partner Stephen Moran, but from the very beginning, odd details arise that keep the two greenhorn detectives from perfunctorily filing it away. Conway has a major chip on her shoulder as the only minority woman on the squad, and it might keep her from seeing things as they really are. Smoothly written, perfectly paced, expertly plotted—every Tana French mystery is a five star read for me. I'm seriously considering getting all five previous books from the library and holing up with them over Thanksgiving weekend.

"Tana French has crafted such an excellent series with the Dublin Murder Squad - I held onto this book for four years because I didn't want it to end (not that it's officially over, but she seems to be onto other things for the time being). And when I tell you it was worth the wait, I say that with complete sincerity.

The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all. And that doesn't just go for romance. I love my ma, I love my friends, I love the bones of them. If any of them wanted me to donate a kidney or crack a few heads, I'd do it, no questions asked. And if they all waved goodbye and walked out of my life tomorrow, I'd still be the same person I am today.

Antoinette Conway, member of the Dublin Murder squad, is a woman who can stand on her own two feet, and it's just as well because from the outset we know that she's an outsider in the team. We're in her head, so there's no way to know what the reasons are, but take your pick; she's mixed-race, female, confident, and damn good at her job. So seeing her paired up with Stephen (he of the first two novels in the series) Moran is a relief, but she's been fighting so hard that she's just about ground herself down into a paranoid mess. She's all edges and defensive spikes - but you get glimpses of what's hiding under that, and once again Tana French has brought us someone outwardly unlikeable, and had me completely invested by the end of the book.

Thankfully I've left this series alone long enough that I get to restart it now, but believe me when I say - this series is one of the absolute best around.

Also (and don't read this if you haven't read the book, because this spoiler would genuinely ruin things) 
anyone else think Breslin finished the job? There's some debate at the beginning over how she was killed - punched and fell, then head picked up and dropped, vs punched when she's already fallen. And with the discrepancy over what he claimed happened - it's all reading between the lines, but it'd be just like Tana French to leave the real story there."
"Ahhhhhhhh. Let’s see. What can I say about this one???

I don’t even know where to start tbh"
"Oh my!! I really don’t know how this author does it but once again Tana French has come up with yet another book with an authentic feel, that bears no resemblance to those that came before it. The Dublin Murder Squad, of which this is the sixth, is not a traditional series rather one or more characters from a previous book appears in a later one, and the crimes they tackle are as varied as the characters that populate the pages.

In The Trespasser Antoinette Conway, one of the detectives who appeared in the previous novel, The Secret Place, is the lead detective on a slam-dunk domestic killing of a young woman. Antoinette’s partner on the force is another detective we met in the previous book, Steve Moran, who has now found his way onto the Murder Squad. The partnership isn’t the easiest, Antoinette still being brusque and feisty and by now thoroughly fed-up with not being accepted by the rest of the team. Both are pleased to have a case of their own to run and will even put up with the arrogant Detective Bresslin overseeing their work to get away from the relentless night-shift and the unrelenting stupid crimes that occur on it.

Having never been in a Murder Squad any more than I’ve attended a girl’s boarding school, the author has created what feels like an authentic recreation of the world that Conway and Moran inhabit. The atmosphere, the décor and the smells are all served up along with the language, by which I refer to the dialogue and the jargon that surely really exist? The book is set fairly and squarely in Dublin and as in the previous novels modern Ireland is gently explored without overpowering the main plot.

The centre of the plot is all about the murder of Aislinn Murray a young woman, identikit to the numerous other women with straight blonde hair and a pout to match, who has had her head bashed in. There is no forced entry to the house and the table is set for two so all the junior detectives need to do is find the dinner date – it’s so easy that Antoinette is frustrated, she really wants a big case, one where she can do some real detective work. When they meet Aislinn’s friend Lucy the pair get a hint that there could be more to the tale, but with Bresslin looking for a quick win with such an obvious suspect, is Antoinette’s reputation for being feisty going to work irreparably against her?

This is a long book, one packed full of details which you really don’t want to miss. As good as the plot is, and it’s fantastic, the most spellbinding part is the unveiling of the characters. The victim is not quite the thick, look-obsessed and no taste girl that the detectives had her pegged at. Nor is the boyfriend quite as boring as he first seemed and with Antoinette herself the biggest mystery of the entire plot there is plenty to absorb and wonder at as the layers of their characters are peeled back to show the reality behind the façade. But be warned this isn’t a straightforward ride with Tana French not adverse to some manipulation of her reader’s feelings; I found my sympathy and concern for a number of characters waxed and waned as different interpretations to the facts seemed certain, and then slid away to the ‘I’m just not sure pile’ all of which meant that I suspected everyone and trusted no-one until pretty much the very last page.

I really can’t express quite how amazing this series is; I’ve loved all the books and each time a new one comes out it becomes my latest ‘favourite’ I’m not going there this time, but if you want a different kind of crime fiction, this series is a definite place to visit.

I was lucky enough to receive a copy of this book for review purposes from the publishers Hodder & Stoughton ahead of UK publication on 22 September 2016. This is my unbiased opinion of the book.

"Follow Detective Antoinette Conway as she leads the investigation into the death of a young woman found in her own home.

In her last novel in this series, The Secret Place, Tana has us reading about the partnership of Detective Antoinette Conway and Detective Stephen Moran. This pair of detectives continue into this novel but thankfully Tana is back to her usual form and structure.

The Trespasser can be read as a stand-alone. It is a first person narrative crime thriller with a linear time scale. This novel ticks ALL the boxes for me. The characterization of Antoinette is spot on and the relationship between her and Stephen is fully developed.

What I liked most about The Trespasser was the brainstorming between all the Murder Squad detectives. Some of their theories and what-if’s were private thoughts, others were spoken challenges between them. They would then move on to follow their lead. As a reader you had two options, think your own theory of who did it and whether it was manslaughter or murder - OR - just ride along with the novel as you are bombarded with countless theories and what-if’s. I liked how all these theories and what-if’s were built into the story and found it very entertaining as each possibility fully explained the death of the young woman.

There is lots of local character and dialogue which adds to the value of this book. Her vocabulary is extensive and I had to tap my Kindle screen many a time to pull up the dictionary definition.

I liked the detailing of the police procedures and the explanation of the interview techniques used by the detectives. I also liked how the characters lied so very convincingly with statements that were very hard to disprove.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Trespasser and it gets the top score of 5 stars from me. I found the story very engaging and think it would make a great television drama.

I put my Kindle down and when I took my dog out for his walk, thought about this novel and how Detective Antoinette Conway was very lucky indeed to get a solve on her case. If only the killer had done or not done this or that, they would not have been caught. Sadly this is the latest of the Dublin Murder Squad series but I hope that Tana will write another. Of the six novels, I have given five of them the top score of 5 stars. Only The Secret Place disappointed me and that was not written in her usual style. I think I have become a fan and tomorrow will be a surprise as I open my Kindle with a different author and genre.

The Trespasser was written in 2016 and is available as an Amazon Kindle eBook."
"I love this series. Seems to be getting better with every book. The only downside is that there isn't a 7th book out yet but as I enjoy the author's writing that much I'll think about reading The Witch Elm while I wait for the next book to come out.

The Trespasser focuses on the same detective team as the last book - only this one is told from the POV of Antoinette Conway. I wasn't sure how I felt about her in the last book. We only got to see her through the eyes of Stephen and I was excited to learn more about the reasons behind her actions. The book did a good job in presenting a flawed character who had its own twisted reasoning to mistrust nearly everyone. Her paranoia plays a huge part in this book as she experiences pressure from many sources in this story. I am still a bigger fan of Stephen and I loved his part because as the story progress you can see that they would make a great team.

As for the case itself, I liked the twisted solution as I wasn't able to guess it right away. Yes, there were moments when I thought it to be a little far-stretched but I loved the fact that it spanned over this huge amount of time. Also, the amount of work some people are willing to invest in getting their revenge is startling.

All in all, great story and I am curious to see in which direction French will develop her murder squad team."
"All of my reviews can be found on www.novelgossip.com

This is the sixth book in French’s Dublin Murder Squad series and I swear each one just gets better and better. It’s not necessary to read them in order, they stand on their own just fine. Each installment focuses on a different detective, though Conway did have a storyline in The Secret Place. I highly recommend the series as a whole, but if you want to jump in at any point it would work.

At first glance, the case that Conway and Moran are assigned to seems very open and shut. As a team, they’re the low men on the totem pole and they generally get tossed the easy cases, mainly domestic ones. Conway in particular is heavily disliked by her colleagues, she’s the only woman on the squad and she’s no delicate little flower. She’s brash, abrasive and snarky and she’s not afraid of any of the men on the team as much as they try and intimidate her. Moran plays the role of lovable goofball brilliantly, but underneath the fluff, he’s got a sharp mind and he’s a good detective. Once the two start diving into the meat of this case, it’s clear this is no slam dunk. Nothing is adding up and fitting together neatly as much as they try to force it, and Aislinn’s best friend and boyfriend are definitely hiding something, but what?

This is a dense and heavy read, but I didn’t want to miss a single word. French’s writing style really appeals to me, it’s so gritty and raw and she nails dialogue like no other. My favorite scenes were when a suspect was being interrogated, watching the process is so fascinating. The way Conway and Moran play against each other in order to tangle a suspect in a web without them even realizing it was just brilliant. Police politics were heavily at play here and witnessing how a murder squad works behind the scenes always intrigues me. Immersing myself into the atmosphere here was easy, things are bleak and dark, but having Dublin as a backdrop always speaks to me. I love reading their slang and imagining their conversations in brogues.

This is not a fast read with brisk pacing, rather it’s a slower read, but one that is methodically plotted and planned. There are plenty moments of misdirection and red herrings, with turns that are unexpected and astonishing. Things are intricate and complicated, both with the case and with the entire cast of characters. I’m always reminded of Karin Slaughter when I read Tana French, and if you’re looking for a good crime fiction series to sink your teeth into, look no further."
"I've read all of Tana French's previous books and this one may be my all-time favorite. Her writing is flawless, her characterizations marvelously gritty and jaded, and the plot grabbed me all-out. The descriptive quality of the narrative and the in-depth astute psychological studies are superb. You're given a mirror into the characters' lives, warts and all, and you feel so close to what's happening that you could be sitting at a desk in the Dublin Police Department.

Antoinette Conway has finally made it into the Dublin murder squad. She and her partner, Steve Moran, have had more than their share of domestic disputes come their way. They are waiting for the big case which seems to be eluding them. Antoinette feels like an outsider on her squad and, even more than that, worries that there is a conspiracy by the good old boys she works with to get her kicked off. Someone has urinated in her locker, her witness statements go missing, and she feels like she's being watched and gossiped about. The only woman on the squad, Antoinette is also a person of color, so she stands out in more than one way. In order to compensate, she's always fighting windmills but maybe they are real.

One evening at the end of their shift, almost to morning, her boss hands Antoinette and Steve a case. On the surface it looks like another domestic. Aislinn Murray, a blonde Barbie type, has been murdered in her home. Someone has punched her in the face and the back on her skull is caved in from hitting her fire place, either by falling or someone bouncing her off of the stone. Steve and Antoinette are shackled by having another detective hoisted on them, assigned directly to the case by their superior. He is pushing Steve and Antoinette to close the case by insisting that the boyfriend went into a rage and killed Aislinn.

After Steve and Antoinette speak to Aislinn's best friend Lucy, they are not so sure that the boyfriend is the murderer. Lucy insinuates that Aislinn was seeing someone else, a secret beau whose name was not shared with Lucy. As Antoinette and Steve pursue this case, things gain momentum and they are led to a place from which there is no turning back.

There are many reasons to read this book - the quality of the writing, the depth of characterization, the well-developed plot, and ultimately, the Tana Frenchness that pervades all of it."
"One of the best books I've read this year. I found the ending a bit disappointing, but overall a very well-plotted, gripping, tense crime novel."
"Another Tana French punch to the gut! Few authors have the ability to take me on such an emotional roller coaster and French cleverly hides this facet of her work behind the guise of a crime novel. Yes, The Trespasser does concern a murder mystery, like the others in Dublin Murder Squad series, and this mystery is better than most of the rest in the series as well. However, to cast this as a mystery thriller is a bit like saying Jack Russel terriers are a little bit excitable and bark occasionally (my last dog was in fact such a dog; if you have ever seen one in action, you will know what I mean).

French serves up as our main protagonist Antoinette Conway-- now a 'veteran' of the Murder Squad to some degree (she has been on the squad a few years) after her debut in The Secret Place, where she was still working in missing persons. Her partner is Stephen Moran, also introduced in the series at the same time and just about the only person in the Squad who will work with her, or indeed, treat her as a human being. The Murder Squad is very exclusive; it only has a few dozen people and they are the best detectives in Ireland. Conway, perhaps my favorite character in the series (and that really says a lot!) takes no shit from anyone. She is smart, strong, independent to a fault, and a good detective, but yet, she never jelled with the Squad. In part this is because she is female; while the Squad is not a male club per se, it sure seems like it at times. She has long been subjected to nasty pranks (pissing in her locker, smart phone in her coffee, spit in her coffee, 'mislaying' her reports, etc.) and feels very alienated from her job. She always, since she became a copper, wanted to work the Squad, but lets say the honeymoon is long over.

For what ever reason, her boss (the 'gaffer') gives her and her partner domestics; these are no fun, albeit usually easy to solve, and she yearns to 'move up the chain' to some exciting crimes. After finally sorting out a stupid bar fight where someone was killed ('a bunch of drunken arseholes'), she and her partner get a new case one Sunday morning. A young 20 something gal was found murdered in her home and it appears to be an open and shut case. As usual, however, nothing is very simple in a French novel.

While ostensibly the novel follows the investigation, this, like her other in the Murder Squad series, is really a richly detailed character study, where a spate of flawed characters, including Conway, receiving their due in turn. Who was the murder victim? Who were her friends? What motivates Conway and Moran? The others in the Squad? Hell, this even opens up existential questions regarding the meaning of life! All of this could be rather ham handed, but French manages to deliver it with aplomb.

We are given a rich tour of Irish working class lives here in the bargain, their aspirations, hopes and dreams juxtaposed to their actual existence. Conway grew up in the 'projects' with her single mom, never even knowing her Da. Determined to not follow her mother's example (although she still calls her daily), she got her 'cert' and went to the police academy, finally rising to the top with the Murder Squad. Most of the other cops grew up in the boonies ('some potato farm') although a few come from money. Conway, however, having achieved her dream of working on the Murder Squad, now has grave doubts about it. She walks into the squad room and conversation dies, people piss in her locker and she gets zero respect.

Now, finally with her own investigation, and at last a chance to do some good police work, she seems to find obstacles at every turn. Someone is leaking details of the investigation to a pompous muckraker; her gaffer forced a more 'experienced' man onto the team-- another pompous arsehole who seems to be keen on closing the case ASAP 'for your own good'. Her partner and her are also having some tension, as Moran seems a better fit for the boys club atmosphere of the squad and damnit, Conway is not some charity case! The tensions and self-introspection just build and build unto the denouement!

French is probably not for everyone; you need to have some interest in crime thrillers at a minimum, and also to enjoy character driven stories (yes, even though this is ostensibly a mystery thriller). I love her use of slang, but some may find the Irish a little hard to follow. ('I gave her a bell' rather than 'I gave her a ring'). Yet, she ties me in emotional knots like very few authors ever have. While this is also something of a slow-burn, it is also very hard to put down. If any of the above sounds interesting, do yourself a favor and give French a shot. I think this, or perhaps Faithful Place were the best in the series. 5 glowing stars!!"
"It is like some writers are writing for you, they get just what is going to make you feel things. Tana French is writing precisely what I want to read, and I had been resolutely ignoring her books since aproximately 2007/2008. (Because I thought they would be a lot more grimdark, or gorefilled than they turned out to be. I am not finding her books nihilistic or manipulatively dreary... It pays to keep an open mind..). My loss (and I did lose doing the fan thing and reading and discussing books as they got published and theorizing about future books), but also my gain because it meant I could binge read listen to all 6 Dublin Murder Squad books in a row. It was glorious.

This is a rather uniquely structured series, there are connections but each book is a standalone and brings absolutely no spoilers regarding who was the murderer previously. There are some slight spoilers regarding relationships (and actually even that is unavoidable, book 1 for example ends a bit after book 2 does, so slight spoiler there) but that is it, each book has a different narrator, a different perspective, different dynamic different concerns even if there are underlying communalities - the relationship between partners, police interrogations (perhaps this series should be required reading for all prospective criminals, just regarding the games the police plays during interrogations), loyalties, Ireland and recent irish history, particularly economic.

Each of this books is not so much a whodunnit where we will be dazzled by clues getting tied together neatly. I think plotting surprises and crime twists is not Tana French's strongpoint, perhaps because that is not what she is interested in, which is fair enough, because what had me really gripped to this book was not, who killed our victim, but other things, what happens to the career of our detectives, what happens to their (professional) relationship, who is corrupt, who is not, and why. There is always an awareness that decisions people make matter and can change their lives, for good and better, and that is far deeper, truer always for our point of view character who is going to make decisions which will change his/her life. The suspense is which ones and which way it will turn.

Tana French books are not perfectly in genre, according to genre expectations IMO but that is just fine with me in general, and particularly here.

I am not surprised she went and stopped writing the series after this one - though I hope she will return to the Dublin Murder Squad (or the Undercover department for example. There was a character here, I would love to meet again..) one day, if she has a story for it. The Trespasser feels almost like it is bookending the rest of the books, like a different take to the In the Woods 
because Steve and Conway are different from Rob and Cassie, and Conway can change and stop and think and as such they can reach a different ending. There is some closure with O'Kelly, who killed an investigation into corruption in the first book. There is a parallelism between Steve and Conway and Breslin and McCann (because it is probably not just a joke, because Steve would likely really help Conway hide the body of that asshole who decided to drop into her life to see if she was worthy of his attention. So we end a series, which is focused on the connection between partners, with a functioning one, their golden retriever and alley cat synergy at work.

Also this is about the redemptive power of people getting over themselves and saving themselves through being able to change how they look at things. Rob could not, Antoinette can. (Frank could in the Secret Place.

Much to think about, so much to process here.

I have listened to the audiobook, recorded by Hilda Fay who has just one audiobook out, this one. She seems to be a friend of Tana French (who was also an actress and that explains, ah, some of the monologues and dialogues) and Hilda Fay is amazing, sublime at this, the timing, the delivery, the accent and tonal variation. The whole series has fantastic narrators actually.

And just noting down, it's very Irish, the slang (I picked some), the grammar, the language, the references, I would have been wary ( I am not a native english speaker as it is probably obvious) but I could not resist and I got rewarded, it worked just fine, better than fine, for me

I am going to read everything else she wrote - trying to control expectations, knowing it will be different, but the way Tana French writes, looks at things, just goes straight to my brain and feelings."
"I think Tana French just gets better and better. This story had me agonizing alongside the protagonist, murder detective Antoinette Conway. The murder squad has never accepted her, her partner may have ulterior motives behind his behavior, she doesn't know who can she believe, let alone trust, and oh yeah, who killed the victim? Sitting in that interrogation room (and you definitely feel like you're there), trying to work out exactly who did what to whom had me stunned. Probably a real policeman would say it's nothing like this, but the whole thing felt awful real to me. French does not disappoint. As usual, she gets you inside her characters' heads. Great stuff.

Bonus: She mentions Whitey Bulger in passing, not enough for this book to make it to my ""Whitey"" shelf, but what the heck? She knows about Boston's bad boy?"
"Another excellent novel from Tana French. It takes a while to get into it, but once done, it goes down in a smooth kind of way. Maybe not one of her best plots, Moran and Antoinette Conway are not very likeable characters, but the atmospheric climate surrounding their investigation makes it up for them. It is not necessary to have read the other Dublin Squad Murder books, this can be read as a standalone by itself. The last part of the book is the best in comparison with her previous novels. The descriptions and dialogues show that French knows how to write an intricate albeit very entertaining police procedural. My rating: 5 stars.
"
"I finished it about an hour ago and I’m still in a mild shock at how incredibly brilliant this book was. Every page crackles with an electricity that I’ve rarely encountered in a police procedural. The way the author plays with conflict and confrontation is just masterful. It reminded me of the early works by Michael Connelly - such is the intensity of this book and how powerful its pull.

This is the first book by Tana French that I’ve read.
I listened to the audiobook, splendidly narrated by Hilda Fay in a strong Irish accent, perfectly fitting every dialogue. And what dialogues!

Such a clever, clever writer. Such a diamond of a book."
"Oh man, I just absolutely love this series! This was one of those books where when I was done, I didn't want to move onto starting a new book because I didn't want to let this one go just quite yet.

This book was so engrossing, I love how you're pulled into the interactions and dynamics among the characters just as much as you are in the murder mystery at hand. And I loved the ending. Not what I was expecting so I was surprised, but in a good way.



"
"A great read that will keep you reading till the end pushing everything else you need to do to the side.

Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran who are the newest members of the squad are assigned dull and routine domestic cases, not exactly something you look forward to in a squad such as Dublin Murder Squad. When they are assigned what appeared to be another case that looks a straight forward domestic fall-out in the murder of Aislinn Murray, Conway and Moran are not swayed by circumstantial evidences and decided to dig deeper. They uncovered secrets, with twists that will keep the reader turning the pages of the book. Conway also has to deal with the issues squad members have with her. Then there is the interesting thread involving her father which author Tana French pulled off superbly.

Thank you Netgalley the Author and Publisher for a chance to read this book."
"Every praise-hands emoji in the world for Queen Tana.

(A bit more straightforward than The Secret Place/The Likeness/Broken Harbor, tonally much more like Faithful Place. Largely concerned with squad politics and no less interesting for that.)"
"As I closed this book, I thought to myself, ""Damn, I love this author."" I cannot wait to read her next book. I'm actually considering rereading all previous five books. "
A great story full of twists to keep one guessing until almost the end. 
"This is Book #6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series and the second that include the characters Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran. The Trespasser is another meticulus, well-thought police procedural. A word of caution - the previous sentence also implies that the book’s pace is by no means fast-paced. This is not a bad thing, but it is worth pointing out. It is somewhat the nature of the beast with police procedurals. There are a lot of details to be attended.
I am a Tana French fan and this book is among my two favorites in the Dublin Murder Squad Series. Conway and Moran are the main characters in The Trespasser . Conway is the lead detective and Moran is her side-kick. Conway feels that she is on her last leg in the murder squad, she is the only woman, and everyone seems to dislike her. She feels that she is seen as a B-word, and she may have a point. Moran is more like my long-haired Dachshund, Ernie, whom wakes up and everyday is Saturday (What are we going to do today, Dad?), and whom never gets in a hurry, and just wants to get along with everyone. Wait a minute? Is that Ernie or me? Oh, well. Conway and Moran do get along fairly well, however, but even they have their moments. But, they do seem to make a fairly effective detective murder team.
A pretty blonde, Aislinn Murray, is found murdered in her “gaf.” She was obviously expecting company for supper - a date. However, she is murdered before the date and the prime suspect would be the date himself. Much of the investigation and interrogation goes into this effort with the prodding of an over-seeing, over-bearing, Detective Breslin. Breslin is bound and determined to nail Rory, the boyfriend.
The interrogation part of the book is extenisve but very believable in a real world. It is a bit uncanny how French manuevers this part of the plot. Plot is much more important than in previous novels in The Trespasser. And, as always, French is top-notch at laying out her character developement with respect to the story. Tana French somewhat amazes me how she painstakingly makes The Trespasser all come together. At the risk of sounding a bit corny, she almost writes literature in the form of police procedurals, a contradiction, perhaps, at best. It is a great book, IMHO.
I believe that anyone that reads police procdurals and enjoys them will immensely enjoy Tana French’s The Trespasser. If you need a fast-paced speed in your books, this one may not be for you. I believe that The Trespasser would make a great police procedural study read. This is the rare 5-star rating for me.
"
"Tana French’s writing is so smooth it's like liquid. A thick honey-like plasma that oozes in and dribbles down into the crevices of your gray matter, reminding you precisely why it is you love to read. French paints a mean picture, and she paints it well. She paints in bright, bold colors, outlined in gold, glinting off with power from the sun. She paints in grays and browns, so thick and muddy you can’t see five inches in front of your face.

Our main character this go round is Antoinette Conway. I liked Conway at first, hard-ass and crotchety, left over arrogance you came to know in The Secret Place, but the more she started to doubt herself and everyone around her, the harder it got to stay by her side. Then, suddenly, Conway steps into the fresh air and you're back. You're with her and you're matching her stride for stride. French has so many specialities...setting, character, mood, storyline, and on and on...so her characters are just flat-out some of the most full-of-life and realistic book people ever.

You devour the thing whole. It's hard to put down because you can’t; you’re starved and stuffed full at the same time. Your head is jam-packed with this story and its life. It breathes and hums with it. French feeds you and still you can’t get enough, but can’t believe you can eat the entire thing. You look at the chunk of book that’s left, once you’re halfway done and you can’t believe there’s that much more. But, there is. There always is, because her stories are life in typeset and there’s always more. The story began before the first pages and will continue on after the last. It doesn’t need you, the reader—you need it."
"[No spoilers] I have read quite a few police procedurals, but what set this book apart was its in-depth detail about the psychology of interrogations. This extended to the questioning of subjects, as well. It was fascinating to hear the questions, then Detective Guard Antoinette Conway's description of why each was asked, and how most subjects normally respond.

I listened to this on Audible and Hilda Fay was absolutely perfect as the angry, bitter Conway trying to do her best in what is typically a male profession, having to fight her colleagues prevailing sexism while trying to solve complex cases. Conway, of course, has her flaws, which only complicates her relationships with other detectives.

Bottom line: the overwhelmingly positive reviews were correct. This was a very satisfying book. I look forward to reading more by the author.

French's writing, both the narrative and dialogue, is very good. The story worked well and came to a conclusion in a very unusual way."
"Сама не вірю в те, що шість детективів Тани позаду.

Коли у січні я знайшла ""розшифровку"" DMS Френч, де було показано як і якими героями історії пов'язані, я заледве думала про те, що буду читати In the Woods. На той час я подивилася Dublin Murders, знала як мінімум канву двох перших книг і, прочитавши кілька нескладних книжечок англійською, думала, що ці файли залишаться невідкритими ще довго (відверто кажучи, я робила більші ставки на переклад Вівату, ніж на свої сили. хе-хе).

І що тепер? Кожна книжка Тани так чи інакше розбила моє читацьке серце. І ні, я не настільки слабкодуха читачка, яку легко вивести з рівноваги тією чи іншою історією, кожне слово я сприймаю спершу зі скепсисом, а тоді зі спробами повірити написаному чи перевірити його. Коли з In the Woods я зрозуміла, що Тана так чи інакше намагатиметься вплести поруч зі здоровим глуздом крихітку фантазії, я була готова прощатися з нею. Так, на той час моя логіка була проста: дайте мені детективів, вбивство, хитро заплутаний сюжет - and I'm in! Зараз я бачу, що це були триггери, гачечки від Тани - в In the Woods, The Secret Place як мінімум - перевірки того, чи здатен читач зануритися у історію, чи здатен він зрозуміти героїв - бо як би всі ті містичні фантазії не виглядали дивно для глядача, який звик до класичного детективу, вони якнайкраще пояснювали логіку героїв - детективів чи вбивць - те, що зробило їх такими: відданими ідеї, захопленими справою.

The Trespasser, шоста і, здається, заключна частина серії, читалася легко і водночас дуже сумно, бо це прощання з Dublin Murder Squad (а такого, між іншим, в Дубліні нема, як так?).

Антуанет, яку з таким скрипом сприймав Стівен у The Secret Place, тут - головна героїня. Вона вже кілька років працює у MS, але як і для Кессі раніше - це не той squad, до якого ти мчиш з легкістю. Вона обожнює свою роботу, але бореться зі стереотипами: жінка у відділі вбивств, ""квоти"", про які шепочуться колеги і через які Антуанет начебто не підпустили у відділок і близько, купа підстав від тих, хто мав би прикривати твою спину - словом, все видається геть не райдужним і Антуанет всерйоз замислюється кинути роботу і проміняти MS на спокійну роботу бодігарда якоїсь багатої дитини.

Але безсонна ніч приносить для них зі Стівом дивну роботу - розслідування начебто побутового вбивства молодої дівчини у її власному домі. Все вказує на те, що вбивця - бойфренд, який саме мав з'явитися на вечерю. Він дивний, тихий, коли до нього приходять детективи, одразу запитує, чи не сталося щось з Айлін - словом, всі докази свідчать проти нього. Але Стів і Антуанет не планують кидати першу ""серйозну"" для них справу одразу в закриті - тут явно щось не те і цей бойфренд, і подруга вбитої щось не договорюють, про щось (про когось?) мовчать. І тривало би розслідування своїм ходом, якби не той самий murder squad - несподівано Стів і Антуанет, двоє newbie, стають для інших детективів кісткою в горлі і всі намагаються змусити їх цю справу закрити. Що тут не так?

На відміну від інших книжок, Тана Френч у The Trespasser вволю відіграється на squad room, показуючи всі деталі розслідування, нарешті (!!!) пояснює на прикладі, хто ж такі та floaters, якими я забембала дівчат, читаючи Broken Harbor, розповідає, як відбувається виявлення доказів, вся робота детективів - навіть найнудніша паперова - і робить це з такою елегантністю, з таким щирим інтересом, що ти жодної миті не думаєш про те, що здалася тобі ця деталізація, вбивцю мені подавай!

Ну і звісно, дует Стіва і Антуанет. Ще з The Secret Place стає ясно, що ці двоє чудово розслідують справи вдвох. Між ними немає тієї хімії, яка мене буквально вбивала у випадку Кессі і Роба, але Стів і Антуанет настільки легкі, ідеально сплетені для цієї роботи, що коли Тана у The Secret Place а потім і у The Trespasser робила оті свої твісти посеред найцікавіших подій, я готова була жбурлятися чимось важким, волаючи: r u kidding me? again?!

Чому цю серію варто читати?

Відгуки на гудрідз, всі ті зірочки від англомовних читачів (будьте певні, я перечитала не один десяток відгуків до кожної книжки, коли згадувала свої враження) - ніколи не будуть об'єктивними, як, власне, і мої відгуки теж. Тана має якийсь талант - зачіпати читачів і кожного за щось своє ""живе"", інтригувати, розбивати серце на шматки і для кожного ""гачечки"" будуть різними, як і враження, вочевидь.

Не забрати від неї одного: чудово виписаної історії - з правильними акцентами (включіть увагу!), хитрими пастками (I crave truth. and I lie), героями, які ніколи не будуть надто ідеальними чи надто лихими і сценарієм, який, здавалося б, йде-йде по своїй дорозі, але в одну мить - і ти заледве встигаєш вдихнути - все змінюється і ти ледь не прогавлюєш поворот, усвідомлюючи - сталося щось надто важливе і треба зупинитися на хвильку, пройти все ще раз.

Тримаю схрещені пальці на те, аби та вся криза минула, видавництва мінімізували шкоду, а Віват таки взялися за переклад. Дивовижно, що вони почали не з In The Woods - читач так заслуговує знати правду!

P.S. 1
Отже, послідовність детективів така:
1. In the Woods - Роб Раян/Кессі Меддокс (побічно Сем О'Ніл)
2. The Likeness - Кессі Меддокс/Френк МакКі (побічно Сем О'Ніл і Роб Раян)
3. Faithful Place - Френк МакКі/""Скорчер"" Кеннеді (побічно Стівен Моран)
4. Broken Harbor - ""Скорчер"" Кеннеді/Річчі Каррен
5. The Secret Place - Стівен Моран/Антуанет Конвей (побічно Френк МакКі)
6. The Trespasser - Антуанет Конвей/Стівен Моран

Це для тих, хто каже, що у Тани послідовність не важлива:) Важлива, ще й як!

P.S. 2
Floaters - як вони мені проморочили голову, ці таємничі floaters! Їх залучав до роботи Роб, ""Скорчер"" взагалі ""виїжджав"" на них пів розслідування, Антуанет залучала так, що мені аж шкода було цих всіх floaters, доки я не в'їхала - це ж треба, у шостій книжці! :D - це newbies, майбутні - можливо! - детективи, які закінчили тренувальний центр, але не доросли до свого squad! Тано, хто ж знав, що іноді у тебе буває все так просто? :)

P.S. 3
І знаєте що?) The Likeness я ще перечитаю. Кессі Меддокс, hello from the other side❤"
"Look, I'm finally reviewing a book... it's so hot, it takes my motivation for doing anything away.



The Trespasser might be my favorite of Tana French's mysteries. As usual, I won't give out too much information, not to worry!

We readers get to know Antoinette Conway and her new partner, Stephen Moran, in a more in depth way than before. Conway's past, and her real and perceived career challenges as the only woman on the murder squad add timely authenticity to the background. What I find most intriguing about these stories are the human relationships, and the way French depicts them.

The main plot is a murder with a solve that is complicated and unpredictable--so many people out to deceive, for so many reasons! At the same time, a drama is unfolding in Conway's life and her professional relationship with Moran is becoming more entrenched.

I highly recommend The Trespasser. It'll keep you thinking."
"I love love love Tana French. Every one of the Dublin Murder Squad novels has been fantastic. Great characters (there was no overlap of characters that I remember from her previous novels in this one) and smart, believable dialogue make these terrific mysteries. It took me a while to get to this one - I'm glad I saved it!"
"I adored this book – I couldn't think about anything else until I finished it. Tana French is one of the most consistent writers working today, and her books never disappoint. The Trespasser has an engaging plot, realistic and likeable characters, and beautiful prose on every page. Honestly, she's so good it makes me want to quit writing."
"I read this book as part of the Richard and Judy book club releases - as always I read before looking at reviews so I had not realised this novel was part of a series !

I really enjoyed this book. I finished it within the day and found the characters so plausible the plot was realistic and I felt it was a good pace and well written.

I'd recommend reading !"
"Finally a Dublin Murder Squad book where I kept trying to guess the murderer really far into the book, though this character, true to form, was introduced in the first pages of the novel. And the question of the main character's leaving the squad kept me on tiptoe up to the very last sentences. Great!"
"English version below

************************

Tana French hat hier wieder einen bemerkenswert guten Kriminalroman geschrieben.
Die Bücher aus der Dublin Murder Squad-Reihe sind alle gut, aber einige sind einfach hervorragend. Dazu gehört auch dieser Band.

Die Protagonistin Antoinette Conway soll mit ihrem Partner Steve Moran im Fall einer jungen Frau ermitteln, die tot in ihrer Wohnung aufgefunden wurde.

Antoinette ist alles andere als eine Sympathieträgerin, eigentlich kann man sie als paranoide unfreundliche Zicke bezeichnen, die dermaßen verhärtet ist, dass sie keinerlei Empathie für andere Menschen mehr aufbringen kann.

Wir begleiten Conway also bei diesem Fall und erfahren einiges über ihre Schwierigkeiten in ihrer Dienststelle. Offenbar wird sie von jedem außer ihrem Partner in der Mordkommission abgelehnt und gemobbt und sie hat ständig den Verdacht, dass es alle auf sie abgesehen haben. Nach einiger Zeit fragt man sich als Leserin schon, inwieweit sie sich das alles nur einbildet. Gleichzeitig hat sie auf ihre Zeugen und Verdächtigen (und grundsätzlich auf andere Menschen) einen herablassenden und verächtlichen Blick. Ich mochte sie wirklich überhaupt nicht.
Andererseits ist sie eine echt gute Polizistin und bestärkt mich geradezu in meiner Einstellung niemals freiwillig mit der Polizei zu reden, da sie ihren Zeugen gegenüber unglaublich manipulativ agiert.

Wie üblich in dieser Reihe wird der Fall am Schluss gelöst, aber nicht so, wie man das vielleicht erwartet hat.

Dafür, dass ich die Protatonistin so gar nicht ausstehen konnte, hat mir der Roman ganz ausgezeichnet gefallen und ich bewerte mit 5 Sternen.

----------------------

Tana French has once again written a remarkably good crime novel.
The books in the Dublin Murder Squad series are all good, but some are just outstanding. That includes this volume.

The protagonist Antoinette Conway is to investigate with her partner Steve Moran in the case of a young woman who was found dead in her house.

Antoinette is anything but a sympathizer, you can actually describe her as a paranoid unfriendly bitch who is so hardened that she can no longer empathize with other people.

So we follow Conway on this case and learn about her difficulties in her department. Apparently she is rejected and bullied by everyone but her partner on the homicide squad, and she constantly suspects everyone is out to get her. After a while, the reader wonders to what extent she's just imagining it all. At the same time, she has a condescending and contemptuous view of her witnesses and suspects (and other people in general). I really didn't like her at all.
On the other hand, she's a really good cop and does encourage me in my attitude to never voluntarily talk to the police because she's incredibly manipulative towards her witnesses.

As usual in this series, the case is solved at the end, but not in the way you might have expected.

For the fact that I couldn't stand the protagonist at all, I really enjoyed the novel and I give it 5 stars.
"
"I tried to respond to a comment but bollixed it up. But it was mostly to say I had the same feeling in the beginning, but the sucker really took off two thirds of the way in and then it got GOOD!"
"Antoinette Conway could be the star of the Dublin murder squad. She works hard, is smart, observant and has a great intuitive sense of how to deal with suspects and witnesses in the interview room. She won't give up in the face of seemingly insurmountable difficulties and still gets a thrill from being a detective charged with solving a murder. She thinks that ""Even when you know trained chimps could do your job that day, the walk to the scene gets you: turns you into a gladiator walking towards the arena...""

This is largely Conway's story as she attempts to solve a murder that at first seems as open and shut as they come. A dead woman (blonde, spray-tanned, elegantly dressed and coiffed ""a dead Barbie"" Conway thinks) who has been badly beaten--broken jaw, cracked teeth, a large hematoma on the side her face--and then fell or was pushed, hitting her head on a corner of the fireplace, killing her. Everyone, from the head of the murder squad, his boss, the senior detectives looking over her shoulder and her partner, wants her to wrap it up quickly by arresting the dead woman's boyfriend and close it as a domestic dispute that got lethal.

Many of the officers who should be natural allies and advisors for Conway are exactly the opposite. They make her work more difficult, hiding signature pages on witness statements or ""forgetting"" to tell her than an important contact called. She has to spend a lot of time and energy fighting against these petty hindrances, any of which could blow up into a major problem and even sink their case, no matter who she finally arrests. Conway is able to force her way through all of this, the only help coming from her partner, an officer who doesn't particularly want to work with her.

Things aren't what they seem--typical in crime novels. French does a bit of a high wire act at the end of the book but the case winds up satisfactorily solved. The only dismay fest by this reader is the wait for the next Tana French novel."
"This is book 6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. If I have any typos in this review, blame it on my lack of sleep last night. I was up most of the night reading this book -- yes - it's that good - or should i say FANTASTIC.

Each book in this series highlights a member of the Dublin Murder Squad and this time it's Antoinette Conway - a new person in the squad with a major chip on her shoulder. Her partner is Stephan Moran, also new but pretty much spends a lot of time trying to make people like him, unlike Antoinette who is perpetually harassed by the MALE members of the squad. The team usually gets the easy cases since they haven't really proven themselves yet. One morning they get what looks like an open and shut case to look into the murder of a young woman. At first glance, the boyfriend is guilty and an older member of the Murder Squad who is working with them, wants the case closed. The team of Conway and Moran aren't totally convinced and dig deeper into the case and at every turn, it looks like it isn't a simple case at all.

I love Tana French books and this one was no exception. Her characters are wonderful - I think Antoinette is one of my favorites of all of her books - and the situations that they get into are very believable. Her books follow the procedures that the police have to go through to solve a case yet she has twists and turns happening throughout. I must admit that i only have one problem with Tana French's books -- the continual desire to turn to the last page and find out how it ends. I barely avoided doing it this time and am always proud of myself if I can fight the urge.

Thanks to goodreads for a copy of this book. All opinions are my own."
"The Trespasser is Tana French's latest entry in the excellent Dublin Murder Squad series. Antoinette Conway (The Secret Place) and Stephen Moran (The Secret Place and Broken Harbor) take the lead, and the dialogue between these two is such a pleasure. Conway is a hard case with some justified paranoia, and Moran's ability to tone her down and offer new perspectives is spot on. They work to each other's strengths.

The Trespasser has a slow, thoughtful pace as Conway and Moran try to navigate the treacherous waters of a murder that at least one detective on the squad wants solved quickly with a predictable outcome. As Conway and Moran seek to give the case a more thorough investigation, they have to be cautious with their information.

French has the ability to toss in situations that keep the reader on edge about the outcome. About half way through, a situation occurs that really worried me, making me question so much of my first thoughts. Near the conclusion, another twist occurs. These aren't the kind of gaudy twists that you find in some books, they are plausible changes as a result of characters' thoughts and actions.

I've read and reviewed all of this series, and French never disappoints. Now--two more years before another book, and I've been wondering who will be featured. Breslin? Oooh, that makes me uneasy.

French is one of the best in the business.

Library Copy

Police Procedural. 2016. 449 pages."
"I am truly a lucky man, In the last week I have read the new Karin Slaughter and now Tana French's latest. Both are really good in different ways. Both of these women are at the top of their game.

The Trespasser is a vintage French, the slow drip of tension throughout the book. I have read all of the Dublin Murder series, now I have to wait again. This book does have Detective Conway again, she is my favorite French character. Enjoy!"
"A woman is found murdered in her home. The case seems like a straightforward domestic, but Detective Antoinette Conway grapples with doubting the killing is that simple. She has seen the victim before, if only she could remember where, and pressure is mounting within the contentious Dublin Murder Squad to close the case by arresting the boyfriend.

No one writes a detective procedural quite like Tana French. I love the lyricism with which she writes. The scenes are vividly detailed. The weather is a forceful presence, and French lends it a physicality that renders the wind and darkness, rain and fog characters unto themselves. In all of French’s novels, the voice is complex, vibrant, and distinct. Here, Antoinette—paranoid (with good reason), forthright, and unflinching—is bitingly irreverent and acerbic. Her commentary had me chuckling in numerous places throughout the story. I loved that even though Antoinette gains self awareness over the course of the tale, she remains entirely true to her character. The characters and their relationships are one of the strengths of French’s stories, and they are relentlessly authentic.

The deep, present perspective French uses forced me to inhabit the character, immersing me in the narrative. The story unfolds in a series of interrogations and conversations that feels as pivotal as a stage play, where every line of dialogue is meaningful. In anyone else’s hands, I don’t think this would work without feeling as if I’m being told what has happened. In French’s talented hands, it is incredibly effective and riveting. Every thread is pulled together in the end, and each red herring exposes another layer of the mystery.

This is a compelling read about the people who play a role in defining your identity, about taking ownership of your own tale and refusing to allow someone else to be the hero in your story, and about the consequences we face when our stories become entangled with someone else’s. Enjoy this atmospheric whodunnit with a cup of tea, ‘drop of milk, no sugar.’"
"One of my favourites of French's novels, up there with The Likeness and The Secret Place.

Antoinette is definitely one of favourite narrators of French's - maybe only rivaled by Cassie in The Likeness. She is iron and will and granite. To wit:

“What-if-maybe crap is for weak people. It belongs to the ones who don’t have the strength to make actual situations go their way, so they have to hide away in daydreams where they can play at controlling what comes next. And that makes them even weaker. Every what-if is a gift to anyone who’s looking for a hold on you, and that means us. If a guy’s whole head is in reality, then reality is the only route we can take to get to him. If he’s letting his mind prance off down dozens of twisty hypothetical fairytales, every one of those is a crack we can use to prise him open.”

“No one needs a relationship. What you need is the basic cop-on to figure that out, in the face of all the media bullshit screaming that you’re nothing on your own and you’re a dangerous freak if you disagree. The truth is, if you don’t exist without someone else, you don’t exist at all. And that doesn’t just go for romance. I love my ma, I love my friends, I love the bones of them. If any of them wanted me to donate a kidney or crack a few heads, I’d do it, no questions asked. And if they all waved goodbye and walked out of my life tomorrow, I’d still be the same person I am today. I live inside my own skin. Anything that happens outside it doesn’t change who I am.”

Damn, girl.

The other character I loved in this one is, surprisingly, the victim - Aislinn Murray. She's dead the entire book, so the only way her character is revealed is through what people say about her, but French does an amazing job of building a complete, whole person from those pieces. She's such a massive presence in this book - it reminds me of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, not actually in the book but looming over it, her presence felt as much as or more than any living character's. From seeming bimbo to crafty, determined, dreaming, and exhilerated with her own power, it's fascinating that the strongest character arc in the book is that of a dead girl. It's not the girl herself who changes, but the reader's perception of her that morphs. Wonderfully done."
My FAVORITE of The Dublin Murder Squad series. So perfect.. so beautiful.. so so good ❤️❤️❤️ 
A gritty crime drama with the most adrenaline filled dialogue during the interrogation scenes.
"This review was originally posted on [Between My Lines]In a gritlit genre full of police procedural novels, Tana French's books shine bright like diamonds.  They are not cheap imitations like so many others out there instead her talented writing showcases her novels as the real deal.  If you want clever, insightful crime fiction, then Tana is your author.


First Line of The Trespasser by Tana French:


""My ma used to tell me stories about my da.""


My Thoughts on The Trespasser by Tana French:


First thing you need to know is that Tana French is my favourite author.

Second thing you need to know is that the Dublin Murder Squad is my favourite series.

Third thing you need to know is that each book can be read as a standalone

Fourth thing you need to know is that you need to read this series asap!

And the last thing you need to know is that this book is every bit fabulous as previous books in the series.


Ok, that's a lot of the need to knows out of the way, now I can get on with the review.  PS - the most important point is number 4, read the entire series!  And if you have the whole series to binge read, then I'm sick with jealously as I'd love to be settling down for a glorious read-in.

Gritty Themes

Set in Ireland, each book features a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad.  A modern Ireland, grit and all, unlike the rosy picture you might get in other novels.  The Trespasser is Antoinette's book.  It depicts the struggle of  being a girl boss in a male dominated environment.  Messages don't reach her, files are messed up, petty little disturbances like you might expect in a teenage drama.

But it all rings so true.  Antoinette has to rise above it but also remain one of the lads and on top of that nail the murder case.  In this case, I feel the crime is more the backdrop of the novel.  A very entertaining backdrop that had me puzzled for a long time trying to figure it out.

Character driven books

Above all else, Tana French writes books about characters.  Complex characters that absorb all your attention.  And her speciality is blurred lines where it's hard to know just what's right and what's wrong.  All described in beautiful evocative language.  Her words are like poetry but action packed poetry that has you reading as fast as you can.

In a nutshell, it's fab!


Who should read The Trespasser by Tana French?

I'd highly recommend this to all fans of gripping crime fiction, especially if you like to read about the tangled personal lives of the detectives on the case.  Fans of previous books in this series such as The Likeness and The Secret Place should also love this.  Finally if you are a fan of Harban Coben or Linwood Barclay, I'd suggest you give this series a chance to woo you.

Thanks to Viking and Edelweiss for giving me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

"Yes! I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.




Tana French is by far my favorite contemporary mystery writer. Every time I read a new book in the Dublin Murder Squad series I'm astounded that she was never actually a detective. She sincerely writes as if she has intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of working in a murder squad, and that's what makes her writing so compelling. From the very beginning of each novel she grabs you with a mystery that pulls you in completely, and then immerses you in the life of a detective. I was so excited when I found out she had a new novel coming out this year, and I can happily proclaim that The Trespasser is another brilliant addition to the series.

If you are new to French, I highly recommend starting at the beginning with her first novel, In the Woods. All of the Dublin Murder Squad books have interchanging protagonists, and Antoinette Conway, the narrator of this book, is one of my favorites. Antoinette is smart and ballsy. She's the only female currently working in the murder division, and she is not well liked by the rest of the squad. She endures harassment and bullying on a daily basis, but she never lets any of the other murder Ds know that they are getting to her. Early one morning she assigned a new case that looks to be just another routine domestic homicide. However, as she digs deeper into the evidence with her partner, Stephen Moran, it starts to look as if there is much more to this murder than there initially seemed.

I read most of this book over the course of an afternoon, and that was only because I had been too exhausted to finish it the night before. I cannot recommend this book, and the entire Dublin Murder Squad series enough. Tana French is fantastic."
"Oh Tana French ... how do you consistently produce such compelling stories?!?! She's one of our best crime writers. And I am here for it. I just love how well she writes characters - they simply come off the page for me. They feel like actual, real human beings with the flaws we all have. And her plotting ... wow. She just grabs you and doesn't let go. She creates this world that I feel I am part of while reading - gritty, real, honest and unflinching. The dialogue, the humor, and just the right amount of tension. I just love her work and I really think she's getting better and better with every book! She isn't what I'd call a quick read - her narratives are smart and French takes her time to tell an exceptionally complex and nuanced story. What can I say? Read it. Read the entire series. They are all so good. Now I'm back to waiting for her next Dublin Murder Squad novel! "
"Ahhhhh, man! I rated the print version 5 stars, but the audio is even better--by like, a LOT! I finished it on my way home from work this evening and was really sad it was over and couldn't even bear to think about starting another book, unless it was to just go back through all the other books in this series (even though I have about a million other UNread audiobooks just awaiting their turns already). I still haven't figured it out.

Anyway, having reread this, I feel like it's actually pretty obvious now that most likely the next book will not be about Breslin or O'Kelly, duh. But I dunno, maybe Fleas? We've flirted with Undercover before, sooooo...???"
"I can't remember ever being so anxious about reading a book. The story twists its way around theories and ""what ifs"", pulling me along until I didn't know what was up or down. I had to set it aside at ""that"" critical point where things just got serious, and discovered that I was anxious about picking it back up and facing the music. How was it going to end?? Pulling up my big girl panties, I dove in to the last 3 hours of the book, only to learn that I didn't want the story to end.

That is the sign of a skilled storyteller."
"I'm so happy I got an advance copy from Netgalley! This is my favorite Tana French so far. Completely engrossing and totally addicting. As always, I love the Irish setting, and the mystery has several very believable plot twists. I'll keep this spoiler free and brief - but Conway and Moran from the last book are back, and I very much enjoyed their characters' development."
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This series is truly in a league of it’s own! I’ll be back with a proper review.. Right now I’m in mourning! I’m so sad that not only the book, but the series is over. 😞
Sidenote though, I’ve listened to the audiobooks & have enjoyed every minute of them!! (Which is no small feat considering how long they are!) Totally recommend them!!"
"I love her; this has the same thematic richness, the same tension, the same sense of of place, as the rest of the series. It's not my favorite of the series, I don't think, but it's still super good and super satisfying."
"Tana French has been one of my favorite authors since her stunning (and genre busting) debut novel In the Woods. In The Trespasser, Ms. French continues her series of murder-mysteries set in the milieu of Dublin, with a different primary protagonist in every subsequent novel. In The Secret Place (the fifth book in what is now commonly known as the Dublin Murder Squad series), Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran worked together to find out who had killed a teenaged boy in the posh private school attended by one of their colleague's daughters. That colleague (Frank Mackey) had previously appeared in The Likeness and Faithful Place. It is this apparently haphazard recycling of seemingly minor characters from previous books into primary characters in subsequent books which sets French's Dublin Murder Squad apart from other series in the genre.

However, in the sixth outing of the Dublin Murder Squad, The Trespasser, she has repeated herself for the first time, using Conway and Moran as the primary characters. Actually, for all intents and purposes this is an Antoinette Conway mystery--she's the only character who gets a first-person narrative, although we get a lot of what Moran is thinking interpreted through Conway's perceptions. Regardless, the two work together to try and solve the mystery of who killed Aislinn Murray, a pretty young lass who was found with part of her head bashed in and a romantic dinner for two burnt to a crisp in her well-appointed apartment after a curious anonymous tip was called into the police. Was the killer her date or a trespasser? Was it murder or manslaughter?

We had previously known from The Secret Place that Conway was an embittered (but excellent) detective but we didn't really know how paranoid (and self-destructive) she can be until we are exposed to her neuroses full-time in The Trespasser. For the first time in the series (I think), French dabbles with the trope of the unreliable narrator.

That being said, to me The Trespasser is French's best book of the series so far, replacing Broken Harbor at the top of the heap. The stakes are raised so high for our protagonists (either Conway solves the mystery of whodunit or she will need to resign from Murder and take a spirit-crushing but lucrative private security job). In fact at one point, Conway basically decides she's going to leave Murder regardless of whether she gets a solve or not (this is one reason I would say that she's an unreliable narrator). One of the last key scenes in the book is near the end when she finally reveals her decision about her future to her partner Stephen.

One of the major features of French's books are her depictions of police interrogations and other conversations in general. As an American reader, some of the dialogue can be impenetrable (""gaff"" for home, ""gaffer"" for boss, ""jacks"" for bathroom and many, many more) but it is the running dialogue of the observations and intentions of the speakers that French includes as the investigator and the suspect duel in the interview room that animates and elevates her books above other mysteries, and this book above the others in the series. In fact, what French does is make it clear that the necessary job qualifications to be a successful Murder detective, namely being able to tell whether someone is lying, always wondering whether someone is telling you the truth or trying to determine someone's motives from their body language and words are things detectives do incessantly and seemingly reflexively). It seems exhausting and absolutely inimical to healthy relationships with other human beings, and we see that play out in different ways in basically all the members of the Dublin Murder Squad that appear in the book (Conway, Moran, McCann, Roche, O'Kelly and Breslin).

But this fact does not lessen the reader's respect or admiration for the difficult job detectives do and the pleasure we can take from seeing them do it in The Trespasser."
"I'm going to tick this little spoilers box, it is my second read and although I have already written a long review of sorts, I want to write something spoilery. I have never understood Fandom. Fans of a Football team shedding tears when their team loses a tournament, getting enraged when one of their own players make a mistake which leads to the opposite team scoring. How they lose their minds when their team wins a trophy. Although, I myself try to watch Chelsea Football Club's games whenever they come on TV, I don't think I have actually been a true fan. Sure I do shake my fist at the TV, when my team scores a goal but Hardcore fandom? Tears and ""We-are-the-champions!!""? I have never been one. To love something, someone or an idea religiously, I have never got that or been one. Not Until I started reading The Dublin Murder Squad series. I don't know why? In the Woods was one of the first books I had tried to read in its original language. Perhaps it was the joy of not having the filter of ""Translated by...."" between me and the author. Maybe it was French's brilliant writing, the grimness of the series's worlds, and my love of suspense thriller novels that I had brought over from reading a dozen of Agatha Christie's books. It was one of these! The next thing I knew, Rob Ryan and Cassie Maddox were as real and as important to me as Hercule Poirot was. I love these books. Antoinette Conway is on her last breath. The Murder Squad has put a target in her back and all of them are after her blood. She leaves her email open on her computer for a minute, and when she comes back her whole inbox, contacts, everything is flushed to nothing. Someone picks her locker and pisses on her statement sheets. She leaves her coffee mug on her table for an instance, and she only stops herself from drinking someone else's spit. To top in all off, All the cases that her gaffer is throwing towards her are slam and dunk domestics, Drug dealers and ""Bollocks,"" the good stuff, The Hannibal lecter ones don't find their way towards her or her partner Steve.Conway is very reserved. She keeps a tight guard. She has had to work her way up to Murder Squad. And the fact that when Roach pulled ""that"" move on her, instead of laughing it off or returning the favor, she broke his finger can be explained with how she has learned all through her life to not give in to the alpha dogs who want her at the bottom of the pack. 
  In school I had my mates. Anyone who messed with me was messing with them too, and none of us was the type you wanted to mess with. When a rumour went round that my da was in prison for hijacking a plane, and half the class wouldn’t sit next to me in case I had a bomb, we tracked down the three bitches who had started it and beat the shite out of them, and that was the end of that
And the fact that she has never ran to Steve about any of the crap ""the squad"" had pulled on her, or talked to him about her dad or even invited him to her house, is something the reader can get behind. French did an excellent job with her!One other thing which is pretty obvious, but it was through this read that I came into terms with was that, Everything the reader hears or sees is through Conway's eyes. Everything! The idea of The great warrior who is fighting her way through the squad while blows are coming onto her from every direction, was Conway spending too much time in her head. There are people like Roach, but there are other, more normal people too. I like how Aislinn's life, and her decisions mirror Conway's. They're absolutely nothing alike. While Aislinn was all about finding closure and tying her life around her dad. Conway was the complete opposite. Like when she says to steve, ""if Aislinn wanted to tie her life around someone who was never there, that's her problem."" Conway saw that her Dad wasn't there, and she learned to live with it. These lines between Conway and Aislinn do get a bit blurred as the story goes on, and it is similar to how almost all of the Murder Squad detectives' cases have had something to do with their own lives; but I think that was another great thing well done to French's credit. Something else I loved was how unique the personality of French' Ds are. In this book and in everything she has ever written. Breslin, the cocky, in love with himself, D, with a movie trailer guy kinda voice who if finds his partner with a body and a smoking gun would never think twice about whether his partner had done it or not. O'Kelly, Steve or Conway herself. Each one of them are so one of a kind. None of them made me think, ""Oh yeah! That's Watson!! But with a different gender.""McCann was great. He was ""the-one-who-did-it."" But I really really like that he could have been anyone. I could have been him! Except for In the Woods and The Secret Place, all of French's culprits have been excellently done. The Characterization behind them have been very good!I would like to read this book again. A number of years from now when I forget about some of its details. "
Such a captivating mystery and riveting protagonist. Definitely my favorite book in the six-book Dublin Murder Squad series.
"I loved this one. Loved it, loved it. So many call-backs to the previous books. That the one person I hadn't really thought about (O'Kelly, the gaffer for the detectives) was the real guiding force in this one. Antoinette and Stephen were fabulous. All the ugly came out in this one and I think has made them stronger partners. I cannot wait for the next book in this series.

""The Trespasser"" follows Antoinette Conway. We were introduced to her in ""The Secret Place"". It's been 8 months since the events in that book. She is now partnered with Stephen Moran (see ""Faithful Place and ""The Secret Place"") and feels ready to make a change. She was focused on getting on the Murder Squad, but it's not what she thought it would be. She's the subject of jokes, put-downs, someone keeps messing with her and her cases, and she feels like the gaffer (O'Kelly) hates her too since he isn't putting a stop to things. She starts thinking she should put in her papers and go work for a friend at a private security firm. O'Kelly comes in and throws her and Steve (I love that Antoinette does not call him Stephen) what looks like a slam dunk domestic. A woman (Aislinn Murray) is found murdered and though an anonymous call called it in, everyone assumes her boyfriend/husband/etc. killed her. However, things look weird on the scene, and Conway and Moran start thinking that something more sinister is at play here. When Conway and Moran get one of the senior detectives assigned to their case to help them with their witness skills (Breslin) the two of them start to wonder if he could be part of some mysterious cabal that killed Aislinn.

There's a lot going on in this book. Conway we find was raised by a single mother who wouldn't tell her who her real father is. Due to her mother's constant lies about things it caused Conway to run head first into being a police officer. We know that she's really good at her job and she likes partnering with Moran. However, she's getting worn down everyday by fighting with the other detectives in the squad. Initially, Moran thinks it may be a good thing to have Breslin along since maybe Conway can practice being nice (yeah that made me laugh too). When the two of them start to think that Breslin may have something to do with Aislin's murder it becomes interesting to read the tension between Conway and Breslin along with Moran and Breslin. The whole time reading most of this book I felt tense that something terrible could happen to Conway and Moran.

I also loved that French went back to having a woman being the POV for one of the Dublin Murder Squad books (I like to pretend ""The Likeness"" didn't happen) and that she was a WOC. Conway is tough and abrasive at times, but we get little peeks into her throughout this book. She does wonder about her father, but has moved past it. She owns her own home, but did most of the work herself and likes it. She loves to run and that seems to settle her. Doesn't cook and doesn't see the point of it. Her and Moran compliment each other, but even Conway is realizing that if things don't change soon, she's going to have to quit, cause even Moran can't keep a lid on her temper for very long.

Conway's thoughts on the victim were interesting to read/hear. She has some contempt towards Aislin for her home, for her inability to let go of her past and move on from it, and even from her harebrained ideas. I think the contempt was there due to her feeling frustrated with her for not being as strong as Conway was in similar circumstances.

The secondary characters were good in this one. Since the first book, I don't think I had a clear idea who is on the squad, Conway does a great job talking about each detective. There is even some reference to former detectives (Scorcher) too.

The writing was so good. I could follow everything and loved where the book went and you get to who killed Aislin and why.

The ending was fantastic. I think if you wanted to end the series here you could. Because things come to an end in a way that I had not thought of at all and you have Conway and Moran realizing things that they thought were true were false."
"I devoured this book. French is one of my favorites. At first, I found this book totally gripping, but I thought it was less mystery-like than her other novels; frankly, there aren't that many options for whodunnit, a lot of the focus is on the animosity the lead detective, Antoinette Conway, faces from her police unit. Though her other novels don't focus on the mechanics of the crime as much as the psychology behind us, this was in many ways the simplest mystery (logistically and suspect-wise) that French has published. But I ultimately realized that what seemed like simplicity was thematic brilliance. First of all, French focuses on the emotional toll taken by racism and sexism; dark-skinned Antoinette is constantly brimming over with anger because she anticipates the insult before it comes. Recent studies on racism and stress bear out French's implication here, that it is a deforming force on your ability to conduct your day or your job or maintain your baseline happiness to deal with the constant onslaught of other people's expectations or derision.

The other thing I found brilliant about this novel is that it's ultimately about the power of story-telling (which is, after all, the basis of racism and sexism as well as so many other forms of interpersonal relation). The title of the novel refers to the man who attacked the victim in her apartment, but it has a broader application to the way that our ideas of ourselves and our ideas of other people shape our perspective of the world and shape other people's perspective of the world. In other words, story-telling, central to subjectivity and to relation, can have its own toxic, haunting power in our life stories, and we unleash that power upon others all the time in violent authorship.

The beautiful thing about the novel is that the denouement bears out that these narratives can be reparative as well as destructive, that the way we understand our affiliations, our social value, and our ethical lives relies on stories as well and can inspire us to do better. This is not as treacly as my summary might sound; in fact, that moment that story-telling causes a character to do better than what the reader (and what Antoinette and her partner Steve) expects is also a moment of defeat--that character will never come back from what they've done, and the noble moment ensures that. But it fits so beautifully with French's dominant theme, without the narrator ever underlining it.

I found this novel perhaps the most powerful existential and social fable of all of her works thus far. And additionally, the cynicism of Antoinette as narrator is soooo engaging and often outright funny."
"Tana French is a favourite of mine. Her forte is the psychological thriller and she really gets into the heads of her protagonists, their drivers, their faults, their idiosyncrasies. About a third of the way in to The Trespasser I thought, not her best, and the reason was the central character, and narrator, Antoinette Conway, who appeared in French's last novel, The Secret Place, with her new partner, Steve Moran. Each Dublin Murder Squad novel is narrated by a character from the previous. From The Secret Place's whose story was told by Moran, the constant reader knows that Conway has 'issues'. Getting into her head, we see just how messed up Conway is, mistrusting and suspicious of her colleagues, perhaps with good reason, perhaps being paranoid. Feeling persecuted and ostracised, Conway is at times whiney and annoying, unpleasant to be around.

But ultimately, it is Conway, potentially an unreliable narrator, who makes the novel so good. It is not French's best (Faithful Place is, in my opinion) but it is damn good. French allows Conway's personality to cloud the case, which initially looks like a simple 'domestic', with conspiracy theories, colour the reader's opinion of other characters and keep us off balance, not knowing where the story is going, who to believe. It is Antoinette Conway's flaws, her inability to fit in, whether self-inflicted or due to an actual black-balling by the squad, which makes her tenaciously follow up leads, look for 'truth' where others might take the obvious option. Until the latter stages of the novel the reader is as unsure as the central character where that 'truth' lies and the rollercoaster leading up the reveal is where Tana French's real strength can be found."
"Holly shit that book was good... It's without a doubt the best in the series... Tana French surpassed herself...

I usually judge how good a crime novel is, by the total duration that it makes my heart go 150 bpms.

This book kept me at that for at least 2 consecutive hours! Like from 70% till the end...

One of the best crime novels I've ever read. Hats off to Tana..."
"
For much of Tana French's latest Dublin Murder Squad mystery, I was worried she was going to let me down for the first time. Antoinette Conway, who was introduced in the previous book, The Secret Place, has such a huge chip on her shoulder about being the only woman on the squad, relegated to the night shift with its domestic cases and drunken brawls as the usual cases.

It is true she is the brunt of much male derision including practical jokes, but any woman learns all the way back on the playground that if you let the bullies know they are getting to you, they will only go after you harder. Antoinette tries to stuff it, but her attitude spills out all over and you just want to give her some good feminist advice.

One night the case she has been waiting for ever since she began her career in law enforcement comes straight from the gaffer (Irish slang for boss) though at first it looks like another murder due to domestic violence, has a scarcity of provable evidence and her nemesis, the slimy Breslin, is assigned as ""back up."" Despite the unfailing cheerfulness and patience of her partner Steve, the two of them go running down so many blind alleys until it looks like Ms Conway will end up losing her job.

Like any Tana French mystery the twists and turns seem endless, even including possible corruption within the squad. I was not let down, only tested. Clever of her to test her readers as much as the case tested Antoinette. In fact, I think the final pages of The Trespasser are above and beyond anything she has done before."
"Undoubtedly Tana French's best book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. This time she brings back two detectives from Book 5, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. They've only been on the squad a couple of years or so and they don't usually get the ""big ones"". This time they think it's just a case of a lover's spat gone awry with Aislinn Murray being the victim and her new boyfriend Rory Fallon being our perpetrator. One of the senior detectives on the case, Breslin, keeps wanting to steer Conway and Moran that way and close the case as soon as possible. Conway and Moran have other ideas and keep digging; but what they dig up is not what you want to find.

Tana French takes us into the heart of the Murder Squad with all the jealousy, jockeying to see who gets the best and high profile cases, general good-natured and bad-natured teasing and harassment (real or imagined) that comes into play anytime you've got a small office with too few people, too much work, and 19 men working with one woman.

I have been a fan of Tana French since her first book in this series. She just keeps getting better and better."
"Silly me, thinking I could just casually pick up a Tana French book and not devour it within two days (or sooner). Another intimate portrait of Dublin Murder Squad detective, this time Antoinette Conway, whom we met back in The Secret Place. I only love Conway and her partner Stephen Moran more now, so I'm heartbroken that we'll be moving on yet again for the next book...I think I read that French may bring favorite POV characters back again at some point--or at least, she hasn't ruled out the possibility, so, fingers crossed! In the meantime, decided to whip up some portraits of Conway and Moran...(Links to my DeviantArt page)
  
 
  
"
"Ah, Ms. French! You have done it once again! Totally enthralled me and left me with answers and still more ""wonderings"" about the people and situations in which they find themselves. No one person is ever really and truly a ""hero"" without having some faulty personality characteristics of their own. And we never really know where another person's mind is exactly at any one moment in time. Humans are complex animals and we would do well to remember that at all times. And I do believe that human nature has a tendency to build outrageously expansive egos from continued and/or 'perceived' success until very negative/""bad"" decisions are made that will eventually deflate that ego back down to size. Just as each of us does tend to get lost in our own stories every once in awhile. It is beneficial if we have someone around to try to give us a ""wake up call"" every now and then; help us perceive an alternate perspective from our own. Ah, I always end up waxing philosophical after reading a French book. I'm thrilled she writes as much as she does!"
"""Redrum, not in lipstick but in blood, said Rellik""

Tana French is on fire, this is a book driven by character and inner struggles, suppositions that kill, assumptions that destroy, preset ideas that derail entire lives; plot is secondary to feelings and character to dialog and atmosphere.

Four Hundred and eighty pages devoured in two days, and now I will have a hard time finding a book as interesting and absorbing as this.

Antoinette Conway the hard woman of irish detectives is such a breath of fresh air, she takes no prisoners and expects no mercy, but she is human like few characters are.

Loved this book, it is intricate and moves fast through all the gear changes and psychological wars, to snare to capture the prey that always hides in denial of their crime, and it does it all without fetishist or sadomasochistic murders, or cardboard victims, it builds real interesting people that could live next door or at least in Dublin."
"I'm consistently amazed at how Tana French keeps putting out first rate character studies that work just as effectively as mysteries. This one is as good, if not better than her early work which is fabulous in its own right. She has a brilliant way of capturing her characters and putting in little details that really illuminate who this person is and where they stand in the story. Like Antoinette Conway in this work, she encounters characters at critical moments in their lives and intertwines these moments with a case that delves into the character's psyche and struggle. At the same time, she crafts complicated mysteries and brings you inside the squad room working along with the other detectives trying to figure out what happened. I love her work and her writing style and I always look forward to anything new she brings to the table. "
"WHY ARE YOU SO TALENTED, TANA FRENCH?! Which demon did you make a deal with, to be able to write such insanely good mysteries with such rich characterization?

The thing about Tana French novels is that even when it's not your favorite of her novels, they're still so good compared to everything else in the world that they're on another plane. This wasn't my favorite of hers (that honor remains with The Likeness), but it was still so deliciously well-done.

I especially loved what Conway, the narrator, had to say about identity, living for yourself, and being the star of your own story. As always, French never writes a simple police procedural; she writes a psychological profile about some detectives solving murder, and invites you to love these deeply flawed people. As always, I did."
"Qué fantástica novela. Más allá de la trama, que me ha parecido excelente, las novelas de Tana French, y esta en particular, son una cuidada e inmisericorde disección de las relaciones humanas ""no elegidas"", de las dinámicas de grupo, de la influencia de una personalidad de rasgos psicopáticos en el funcionamiento de una colectividad. El veneno de la maldad y cómo muchas veces nosotros mismos potenciamos sin querer su efecto.
Inmensa. Trasciende, con mucho, las convenciones del género policíaco."
This is a superb read and an intricate mystery. Loved it.
"!!!!! I've missed you, Tana."
"When I first read In the Woods in 2013 I thought ""this book is a breath of fresh air in the mystery genre. A one off."" I've come to realize that Tana French is her own sub-genre within mystery - creating books where the detective's quirks and the crime exist in a perfect synchrony. Brilliant and unique in that we're not forced to watch the world's most worldly and wily detective take on fiendish foe after fiendish foe book after endless repetitive book. Instead we get a new deeply flawed, self-destructive and utterly perfect character to climb inside with each story.

You shouldn't read this if you haven't read the first five. And, honestly, if you haven't read the first five what are you reading? There is a short list of authors whose books I grab automatically. Tana French heads up that Must Read List. I've yet to be disappointed - as a matter of fact, each book simply confirms my decision.

PLOT - Ha. Right. Antoinette Conway (along with Stephen Moran!!!) investigates a simple domestic murder. She's not the most popular detective on the squad. As in French's prior novels - the case is viewed through the skewed lens of the detective. Paranoia. Confusion. Exhaustion. Those are about to become your world. Are you ready for gritty eyes? Running on fumes? Constantly looking over your shoulder? You're going to slip into Antoinette's messy life like a pair of slippers - but when they're hot and itchy and you're desperate to have them off? That's a no go - things are just starting to get interesting."
Nothing like starting off the year where the murder victim shares your name (or a variant thereof). French is such a brilliant writer that 400+ pages is not enough. I know when I pick up one of her books that nothing will get done for the next few days--non stop reading is required. One of my top favorite authors and a blisteringly good read. Beyond 5 stars.
"When this book came out last year, I read a review of it and knew immediately that I wanted to read The Trespasser. The problem was that it was the sixth in a series.

Now, we know that I am constitutionally unable to start a series in the middle or at the end, so I set about to read the preceding five books, in their order of publication. In May, I finished book number five, The Secret Place, in which detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are featured. Finally, I was ready for the book that I had wanted to read in the first place.

Let me just state up front that The Trespasser was worth the wait. In fact, in my opinion, it is the best of the lot.

When we join the Dublin Murder Squad this time, Conway has been there for perhaps a couple of years, but Moran is still a newbie. He was brought on board on Conway's recommendation after they worked the St. Kilda's School case together. They are now partners and it is basically them against the world. Or at least them against the rest of the Murder Squad.

Conway is the only woman on the squad and she is subject to constant misogynistic harassment of the Good Old Boy type, something that most women who have worked with men can probably identify with to a greater or lesser degree. Conway is tough, but at the time she and Moran are assigned to their latest case, she's just about ready to chuck it all in and go work for a security firm.

The partners, up until now, have mostly been assigned to domestic cases, generally the most easy to solve. Now, a young woman has been found dead in her home with a severely bruised face and her head cracked against the stone of her hearth.

Aislinn Murray lived alone. She was a beautiful young woman and, at the time of her death, had apparently been preparing a romantic Saturday night dinner for some lucky man. Did the romance turn sour and the man start punching Murray causing her to fall and hit her head and ultimately die? It'll be up to Conway and Moran to find out. They are assigned the case.

Suspicion initially falls on the boyfriend who was going for that romantic dinner, but he swears he never got into the house. Aislinn never answered the door when he rang and he finally decided he had been dumped and went away. He says he had never been in the house at all and there are no fingerprints or other evidence to give the lie to that story.

Nevertheless, one of the detectives assigned to the investigation, Breslin, the old pro who Conway and Moran see as their squad leader's eyes and ears, the one who is to see that they don't go off track, insists that the boyfriend did it and keeps trying to push them in that direction, even though there is the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence.

Meanwhile, the victim's best friend hints at another man, a married man, that Aislinn was involved in, but insists that she doesn't know the details.

And there is another thing that is niggling at Conway's mind. She knows that the victim's face is familiar. She has seen her before. But her record is clean. There is no clue to where and under what circumstances she had met her, and she just can't remember. Until she does.

There are red herrings aplenty in this plot and, while running them to ground, Conway must also deal with the daily petty hassles of the men (or is it really just one man?) who want her off ""their"" elite squad. It was enough to make me want to hit somebody just reading about it!

I found this book to be so well-crafted that I really cannot find one negative thing to say about it. The characters, both main and secondary, are memorable. They are complex, stubborn, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, and appealing. Even Antoinette, who is often irritable and unlikable, is appealing. The pace of the story is sometimes slow, sometimes fast, but that is intentional and mimics the actual pace of an investigation.

And now, what do I do? I'm left with a sense of melancholy that there are no more Dublin Murder Squad mysteries to read. Tana French needs to get busy with the word processor and give us another. Soon!"
"Tana French at her best.

After having many problems with the last book in the series- The Secret Place- I loved this one to bits.

Antoinette Conway is an extremely unlikable character, but as it's usual with French, she managed to make her, and the story, so utterly compelling that you end up liking her. It takes a while to warm up to the characters, but the pay-off is well worth the few stumbling moments during the first third of the book.

I loved Moran to pieces.

PS. Muchas gracias a mi papá, patrocinador oficial de este libro. Porque yo ni de pedo hubiera pagado su precio estratosférico."
"""Gefrorener Schrei"" ist Band 6 der Reihe Dublin Murder Squad. Die letzten drei Bände sind in besonderer Weise miteinander verflochten, Stephen Moran ist eine Nebenfigur aus Sterbenskalt (2010) und Antoinette Conway tauchte bereits in Geheimer Ort (2014) auf.

Der Mord an Aislinn Murray geschieht in Stoneybatter, einem ehemaligen Arbeiterviertel im Norden Dublins, in dem auch die Ermittlerin Antoinette Conway lebt. Das Opfer wird mitten in den Vorbereitungen zu einem festlichen Dinner für zwei ermordet. Der Haushalt der jungen Frau wirkt wie frisch aus dem Möbelkatalog; alles ist eine Spur zu neu, zu gewollt und zu sauber. Callgirls oder Agenten könnten ähnlich inszeniert leben wie Aislinn. Der Täter hat durch sein planvolles Handeln sehr viel über sich preisgegeben, doch Conway und Moran wollen weder an eine „einfache“ Beziehungstat glauben, noch an einen perfekten Mord. Von Aislinn entsteht bald das Bild einer Person mit wenigen Kontakten und wenig Menschenkenntnis. Jede Zeugen-Aussage aus ihrem Bekanntenkreis wirft die Frage auf, welches Bild der jeweilige Zeuge inszenieren will und was wirklich dahintersteckt.

Das Arbeitsklima innerhalb der Mordkommission war schon vor der aktuellen Tat angespannt. Erfolgserlebnisse sind selten; die Ermittler sind frustriert darüber, dass die Polizei offenbar nur zum Stopfen von Löchern eingesetzt wird, während sich gleich daneben neue soziale Probleme auftun. Teamarbeit scheint ein Fremdwort zu sein, so dass Conway stets vom schlimmstmöglichen Desaster ausgeht. Sie erwartet, dass Informationen nicht an sie weitergegeben werden und sie sich um jedes Detail selbst kümmern muss. Antoinette Conway hat sich als einzige Frau in der Mordkommission noch nicht durchbeißen können. Mit Steve Moran arbeitet sie zwar gern zusammen, fürchtet jedoch, dass sie bei der Polizei auf der Abschussliste steht. Antoinette sieht sich einem Kampf an allen Fronten gegenüber, sie muss Ergebnisse liefern, sich gegen missgünstige Kollegen zur Wehr setzen – und das berühmte Leck in der Dienststelle stopfen, durch das Informationen nach außen gelangen.

Erzählt wird der komplexe Fall aus der Ichperspektive der leitenden Ermittlerin Antoinette Conway. Die Neueinsteigerin, die sich in ihrer Dienststelle als einzige Frau gegen bestens vernetzte erfahrene Kollegen durchsetzen muss, scheint eine beliebte Figur im Kriminalroman zu sein. Die gewählte Erzählperspektive zwingt die Leser in die Sichtweise einer Person mit all ihren Irrtümern und Umwegen bis zur Klärung eines Kriminalfalls. Antoinette selbst zweifelt ihr erstes Lösungsmodell an als zu glatt, zu perfekt. Auch ich habe mich gefragt, wo der Haken verborgen ist und ob sie sich nicht unter Druck zu einem Schnellschuss drängen ließ. Tana French sät systematisch Zweifel an ihrer Heldin. Der Prolog hatte schon zu Anfang die Frage aufgeworfen, aus welchen Motiven Antoinette Polizistin wurde und warum sie sich ständig unter Rechtfertigungszwang sieht. Als Leser kann man sich dabei beobachten, wie man sich von dieser Ermittlerin mit Ecken und Kanten förmlich einwickeln lässt. Eine Reihe moralischer Fragen wirft Tana French auf. Wie weit verbiegt sich jemand, um Karriere zu machen? Wie weit gehen zutiefst verletzte Kinder, die von ihrem Vater im Stich gelassen wurden? Wie kann eine nicht perfekt ins Bild passende Aufsteigerin ein gut geöltes Old-Boys-Network aus dem Takt bringen? Dass die Ermittlerin wie auf dem Präsentierteller im selben Viertel lebt wie das Mordopfer, hat mir eine zusätzliche Schicht Gänsehaut beschert. Die unangepasste Ermittlerin und Dublin als Biotop, in dem jeder jeden kennt und nichts lange zu verheimlichen ist, haben mich hier direkt angesprochen.

Auch wenn die Vorgängerbände noch nicht alle bekannt sind, lohnen sich Tana Frenchs Krimis unbedingt zu lesen. Den Geldbeutel freut der Einstieg in eine erfolgreiche laufende Serie weniger."
"	After reading only ten pages of this novel, I was hooked. Tana French’s writing was like a breath of fresh air.	The narrator is Antoinette Conway, the only woman detective in Dublin’s murder squad. Along with her partner Stephen Moran, she’s inherited a difficult case. Conway is hated by her male police colleagues and they go to some difficulties to make her life and job miserable such as urinating in her locker and stealing the last page of her witness statement. Male chauvinism is alive and well in the squad.	French has written a book that might be classified in a variety of genres: mystery, police procedural, psychotic character study, and a reflection on the weaknesses of human nature that can lead to disastrous consequences. French also makes the reader feel totally immersed not only in the murder case but in the atmosphere of the murder squad’s working environment; you can almost smell the sweat and cigarette smoke. We’re treated to various forms of Irish police slang such as gaff (living quarters), the gaffer (the superintendent of detectives) and shite which is pretty universal. The other unusual words are easily understood from their context.	Conway and Moran work hard to investigate the victim’s (Aislinn) family background, the victim’s best friend (Lucy), her latest boyfriend (Rory), and other potential suspects. The detective duo are also “helped” by two senior detectives, Breslin and McCann, who appear to have motives different than trying the find the murderer. 	There are plenty of surprises, plot twists and false leads sprinkled throughout the book and you won’t be satisfied until you read the sad but satisfying ending. It’s one of the best fiction books I’ve read this year and I’m looking forward to reading more of Tana French’s work."
"This was such a good read. I've read all of Tana French's books and while I didn't like this one quite as much as Faithful Place, it's pretty darn close in my estimation. I think I liked this book as much as I did because it succeeded on two levels.

First of all, it's a well-written, intricate police procedural. The mystery of who killed Aislinn Murray starts off looking like an open-and-shut case of dating violence. Until it doesn't. Antoinette Conway's quest for the truth takes readers down many plot trails and the way in which the puzzle comes together is fantastically done.

The psychological aspect of this story is well done, too. Each of French's books has a different narrator and therefore a different feel to it. Antoinette Conway is the only woman in the Murder Squad and as a result of her past and some of the harassment she has dealt with, she has a bit of a chip on her shoulder. She can be rude and brash on occasion, but I appreciated her toughness and her sometimes blunt realism. She's not warm and fuzzy, but neither is she purposefully malicious. Over the course of this book, she learns a lot and gets quite a dose of self awareness along the way. By book's end, I liked her even more. I also especially enjoyed the windows into her working relationship with her partner, Stephen Moran. They're good together."
"I honestly hope Tana French NEVER gives up writing. Ever. I would follow her to the ends of the earth if she'd just keep spinning stories and creating people to populate my subconscious (think Inception; I'm positive Cassie Maddox +Frank Mackey are wandering around in there somewhere). While this one may not be my top favorite so far in the Dublin Murder Squad series I have nothing but love for it. It took me forever to start it, considering I was practically counting down the days to its publication, but I'm glad I took my time to really savor all of its depth and appreciate all of the angles. I have said for a few years now that Stephen King is a master at creating people, not just characters, which is part of what makes me love his stories so much, but I think Tana French may have him beaten for the qualities and complexities of her players. The way her detectives think 2 or 4 or 6 steps ahead of whatever they're looking at, and they have to considering they're detectives, it's beautiful. Maybe it's only Antoinette Conway who is really shown doing this -I have only read all the books once and not recently- but it's an admirable trait in real people, let alone plausibly conveying a fictional character doing it every day, sometimes every hour.

Five very well-deserved stars to this most recent addition to my favorite murder series. Please keep on doing, Tana.!"
"And now I'm sad because this is the last book in the Dublin Murder Series.

The Trespasser was such a good book guys! It has my favorite character Detective Conway. She's such a bad ass within the murder squad and I just love how awesome she is. However, it was really sad to read the prologue in this book because it deals with Antoinette Conway trying to figure out who her missing dad is. Every year she asks her mom about him and every year it's a different story. I don't know how I would feel about a guy who has been missing my entire life and realize that he's a terrible guy and my mom was just trying to protect me. I'd probably break down and cry and then be angry at him. But who knows - because this isn't my life.

I loved the work relationship and friendship between Conway and Detective Moran. I don't really want to spoil a whole bunch about this book (other than the prologue of course!) because I really want people to read this series. I loved every book, every story, every page of this whole thing. I'm pretty much in love with Tana French. I really need to see if she has any other books out and then probably spend all of my money on them.

I recommend this entire series - it's so fucking good. Seriously drop whatever you're doing in your life and go out and get these books!"
"Having read all of French's Murder Squad books, I'm obviously a fan. That said, some books are better than others. In a few books, I always thought she pushed the limits of believability... not in The Trespasser!

Not only did she have an interesting and utterly realistic crime but she served it up deliciously authentic. This is a better book because it has more depth than most of the others. And it leaves lots of lives in tatters. A French trademark.

Our Murder Ds in this storyline have lots to prove and take lots of time proving it. Squad room tension, paranoia and secrets characterize this book from the start... and then there's the victim. A secret unto herself.

That all adds up to a four-star read, but then French earned herself a fifth star from me...

Antoinette Conway! Inner dialogue at its best. Giving readers a glimpse at what it's like to always be on the outside of a man-dominated world. And she nailed it!!

The beauty of the Murder Squad series is you don't have to read them in order... however, French has sharpened her skills from book to book. Reading them in order means you get to ride along and see the sights which just keep getting better with every stop!!"
"""The truth is, if you don’t exist without someone else, you don’t exist at all.""

I love Tana French. Her books are always full of complex characters and very detailed personal character building. And, this character was really hard to like. Antoinette is super prickly and really awful - she's paranoid and ultra independent. She likes everyone around her to know she's the smartest one in the room.

And this mystery is a good one- there were a lot of twists and turns and I was definitely pointing to all the wrong people. I was so glad when we did get the full answers in the end - I definitely needed to know if I'd gotten it right or not...... (and I did not....)

I'm really hoping this isn't the last one in the series......I would love to read more!"
"My favorite Tana French mystery so far, and I have loved almost all of them :D
She's just so good at writing characters and conversations and situations that feel real. There's no one else who writes such character-centric and layered mysteries that are as much about the detectives and their personal baggage as it is about the actual plot. I love how this one addressed two sides of the coin when it came to sexism in the squad and expectations/judgments made about women and how wrong those preconceived notions can be. Conway is awesome but Steve stole the show; he's so adorable and lovable and I'm so glad to get another book with him as a main character :)"
"Well she did it again. I swear I don't know how she does it, but Tana French has a way of totally making you feel sorry for these people that you've hated throughout the book. Well, maybe hate is a strong word...dislike? Whatever you want to call it, at the end I just wanted to give the guy a hug. The way Antoinette just obliterates him, I felt it in my gut. I could see it all play out in my head and my heart just broke. I was satisfied with how this all played out and the ending was surprisingly a good one. This is such a great series. "
"I'm wrecked, having stayed up til the wee hours to finish this one. As per usual, I was twisted in knots by both the characters and the plot. I never know when I start a Tana French novel where it will end up, but when my favorites survive it's a huge relief. If you love a well written, taut procedural with deep character development, you won't be disappointed in this one. Maybe not my favorite of hers, but a strong addition to her list."
"oh my gosh! Saved this book for vacation in Hawaii and couldn't keep my nose out of it. While my husband was snorkeling off Lanai i sat on the seaside and finished reading, couldn't even stop for lunch. Previously ""In The Woods"" was my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book but it has been taken over by ""The Trespasser"". Highly recommended for not only a great mystery, a terrific police procedural, but especially for the character study, Antoinette Conway is one complicated Detective."
"All of the books in this series are well-written with complex characters and stories. There is very little book-to-book character-building because most characters aren't continued. Now that we've had a little more on Conway and Moran, I'm guessing they'll drift out of focus like the other primary detectives in the series. I think it's a great way to keep the serial reader's mind on the crime and trusting no one. Excellent thriller."
"Tana French is one of my most favorite writers, definitely at the top of the mystery writing genre. In this 6th book about the Dublin murder squad, as always from the perspective of a different detective, she once again delivers a terrific mystery, terrific character work, and terrific writing. Couldn't put it down."
"I feel like I knew who the secret boyfriend was going to be about a mile off, so most of the book was just filling in the details of what I had already figured out. Not quite as convoluted or punch-packing as THE WITCH ELM, but definitely still kept me reading. I’ll be picking up more work by this author soon I think. "
Another amazing Tana French book. Her characters and plots remain as vivid and heartbreakingly real as ever. Cannot wait to discuss this one with everyone I know.
"Hilda Fay, an Irish actress with a beautifully authentic Irish accent performs this audiobook.

Another terrific novel from one of my very favorite writers."
Eloquent review to come when I find bunch of synonyms for 'amazing' and 'perfection'.
"really enjoyed this one by french.

especially happy as her previous The Secret Place was a DNF for me."
4.5 Stars 😊
"The best of French so far. Amazing. A real rollercoaster of “if”s and suppositions. Crime at its best. You could jump into the Dublin Murder Squad right here if you wanted, but do read this book. "
"I love French's style and the way she uses these mysteries to explore ""normal"" people and normal crimes. "
"Will try to write a review when I get a chance, but it was a good read, and the ending made me think."
"Another excellent title in the Dublin Murder Squad series (which apparently I am now reading out of order). We follow Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Detective Stephen Moran try and unravel the mystery of Aislinn Murray's death. Conway, a tough outsider, is facing sexist and racist harassment from the squad and is buckling under the weight of her own paranoia. French well captures the pervasive toxicity of a horrible workplace. Conway has to keep her coffee cup with her everywhere in case someone spits in it. She has to keep her files under lock and key in case someone steals them. She is constantly on the look out for coded messages from friends and enemies. But how much is real, and if it is real, is it just the innate racist patriarchal hazing endemic to the police? Or is it the sign of something greater?

I liked Conway a lot, and she is quite different to the other French narrators I have read, so I applaud that, although I got a bit weary of ""gaff"" instead of house (I get that this may well be believable inner speech in Dublin). I really enjoyed the parallels between Aislinn and Conway, and this kind of consideration was often rather subtle. 
Conway HATES Aislinn, this girl whose life is dominated by her absent father and uses the perception of her vulnerability to get what she wants, Conway's Gothic double and opposite. I liked too, how much of the book is Conway and Moran chewing over, worrying about and talking out the case. 
I enjoyed the circular nature of this, the realisation of what the answer must be no matter how unpalatable and inconvenient. It almost reminded me of a Megan Abbot novel, the gap between realisation and understanding In all, an excellent entry in a series I am really enjoying."
"This was excellent. Not perfect (in my humble opinion, slightly too long - though I acknowledge I'm saying 'too much of a good thing' here, perhaps I was impatient to reach the denouement and the preceding cleverly woven set-up was layered for longer than I wished) but nevertheless very enjoyable and impressive indeed.

This installment of the Dublin Murder Squad series seen unpopular Garda detective Antoinette Conway investigating what appears to be more than just a routine domestic argument gone bad, piecing together the life of the young woman found dead on the floor of her house on the night she had invited her date over for dinner.

French's strength lies not only with the cleverness of her plots, but also with the insight she brings into to the day-to-day lives of her characters. Heavy on the procedural, at times (as mentioned) I felt this went on too long, the atmosphere of the incident room and Conway's suspicious and battles to be taken seriously in the male-dominated squad layered on thickly, but this didn't prevent the novel from being an overall very satisfying read."
"Tana French is always good. I seldom give 5 * and I've tried to think of a reason not to give this one the highest rating but I can't. It's just that good. Complex likeable main character, believable villains, sharp language. And I don't even like murder mysteries/police procedure books. "
"A very exciting thriller to get me back into fiction in a way I haven’t been in a while, interspersed with intriguing characters and interesting insights into human psychology (not in a sciencey way but rather that emerge from the narration and investigation)."
"I freaking loved this. Did not see the end coming, which I usually do. Found it very affecting.

It was great!"
"This may be my second favorite Dublin Murder Squad book after The Likeness. Maybe it's not a coincidence that these are the two books featuring a female lead.

Detective Antoinette Conway has a chip on her shoulder she can't stop picking at. She faces harassment at work and is convinced that everyone on the squad wants to see her fail. She's even quick to suspect her loyal partner, Detective Steve Moran, of turning on her. She is a prickly, angry, porcupine of a person.

But her latest case finally makes her see that the stories she has been telling herself for years are not the stark truth but a narrative she has woven for protection. Conway and Moran are assigned a murder that is supposed to be simple and straightforward - domestic violence, likely a boyfriend who got mad. But it turns out that it's far more complex and could finally be the thing that destroys Conway's career.

Conway is not a likeable protagonist for the majority of the novel, but unlike Rob Ryan in In the Woods, she evolves and grows. And French is brilliant at creating fully-fleshed, human characters. Even when I did not like Conway, I respected and understood her.

The climax of the book was also a full-force punch straight to the heart. It is a slow, thoughtful march to that point - this book is nearly 500 pages - but it is absolutely worth it for the payoff."
"This is my first Tana French novel. It will not be my last. I was hooked from the start and the story had me guessing all the way to the end.
I love when a story makes me question everything. Just when I thought I had it all worked out, there was another twist to turn everything upside down! Brilliant!

Definitely a ‘must read’!"
"Many words can be used to describe the works of writer Tana French: complex, riveting, suspenseful, powerful and real. But there is one word that can truly describe all six of her books in the Dublin Murder Squad series: consistent. They are consistently well written with startling reveals, compellingly human main characters, and answers that are never simple or happily ever after. Some readers may quibble the fact she has a different main character each book or contend the point some of her stories do not have an easy or concrete ending. But all will agree she is one of the best detective mystery writers we are privileged to read.

The Trespasser is a perfect example of what makes French’s writing so worthwhile. As she has done in the past, she has switched out the main character from the last book with the detective’s partner. Stephen Moran told the story in The Secret Place while his partner, Antoinette Conway rode shotgun. In this book, Conway is running the show and I loved it. Conway is tough, smart, abrasive, and sometimes overly paranoid but only because she has to wear her bitchpants to work in a squad of men who have trouble accepting her presence. Shields definitely go up when you find someone has urinated in your locker or put your cell in your coffee or maybe even spit in it. It's amazing the woman doesn’t go postal on her coworkers; I would have applauded. But it’s not because she���s a wimp, she just knows the code: make a complaint and you move to the back of the line.

When Conway and Moran get what appears to be a cut-and-dried domestic homicide case they feel there has to be more to the story than an angry boyfriend. Too circumstantial and too many missing pieces, they hold out on an arrest much to the annoyance of other members of the squad. Then things get really really complicated. Conway knows the victim from her past. Someone is casing Conway’s house. There is an encrypted file on the victim’s laptop. Conway’s paranoia concerning her fellow detectives kicks into high gear and threatens her position in the squad. And when Conway and Moran finally put all the pieces into place, the answer is even more complicated and destructive than they ever imagined.

That’s the beauty of French’s novels: the answer is never simple, never straightforward. And the main characters are always in danger, more times than not, mostly from themselves. Her writing is beautiful with indelible imagery. Her characters are deeply flawed. Conway may irritate some readers but that’s why I liked her. She reminded me of Frank Mackey or Scorcher Kennedy from earlier novels and those two were prickly but powerful characters.

I don’t know who will lead in the next book, I would love to see more of Conway and Moran, but if French follows her usual recipe, they will be new and bold and memorable. Hopefully Conway will make a cameo and create some havoc."
"Tana French's books have won books the Edgar, Anthony, Macavity, and Barry awards, the Los Angeles Times Award for Best Mystery/Thriller, and the Irish Book Award for Crime Fiction. But I only discovered her when I read her previous book, The Secret Place. It was a fantastic read and French is now on my must read list.

Her newest book is The Trespasser - the 6th entry in her Dublin Murder Squad series. It too is a fantastic read, better than The Secret Place in my opinion.

Detective Antoinette Conway set the Murder Squad as her goal when she joined the Dublin police force. She's made it there - but it's not what she had hoped. She's the 'odd man out' and by default so is her partner Stephen Moran. The rest of the squad seems to be hell bent on driving her out of the unit. Conway and Moran's cases are mostly domestics and their hope is for something bigger, one to make their mark.

They're sent to a death - at first glance it looks like another domestic. But when the higher ups send along another Detective to 'help' them, Conway wonders why. And when the pressure mounts to solve the case quickly, Conway digs in her heels.

I love Conway as a character - she's unbelievably tough, tenacious, fearless and smart. But this unrelenting harassment is beginning to chip away at her - there are some chinks in her armour. Moran is just as well drawn - there is more to him that what he presents to the world. He was the narrator in The Secret Place, so he was a character I already knew and liked. The dynamic between the two is evolving, unpredictable and addicting to follow.

The plotting is simply unbelievable - intricate and evolving as the book progresses. At no time did I ever think I could predict where things were going to go. Instead, I felt like I was there with Conway and Moran as they try to puzzle out the latest lead or brainstorm a theory. The procedural details ring very true. What's not as clear are the undercurrents and the unspoken. Everyone lies. Everyone has their own agenda. Who can Conway and Moran trust?

French's settings and descriptions are rich and detailed. I felt like I was walking the cold, damp streets with an eye on the alleyways. French makes her home in Dublin and that personal knowledge enhances time and place.

Dark and gritty, this is mystery writing at it's best. I'm really looking forward to the next in this series - and who will be the narrator. I'm invested in French's characters and intrigued by the cases she imagines. This series is definitely recommended!"
"I stayed up way too late last night because I had to finish this book. This is the best of the Dublin Murder Squad series if you want a strong focus on the police investigation focused mainly within the walls of the Incident Room. I also especially appreciated the tangible clues and evidence without any of the creepy, borderline paranormal leanings of some of the earlier books in this series. We focus on the new partnership of Murder Detectives Conway and Moran who were in the previous novel, The Secret Place. Their chemistry as partners is brilliant, sharp and witty. Aislinn Murray was obsessed with finding out what happened to her father who disappeared when she was nine, turning her world upside down. Her mother never recovered from the loss and died young and Aislinn lived in a bubble of grief and caring for her mother, which left her ill-prepared for life in the real world. While smart, she is naive and lives inside her self-made fairy tales that became her coping mechanism. Then she decides that she is going to find out once and for all what happened to her father. Then she ends up dead. Who killed her? Was it her father or someone who didn’t want he looking for him? Did he have mob connections that required him to flea the country? Aislinn’s quest leads her to change her appearance, losing weight and wearing cloths and make up sure to turn heads, so she can snag the lead detective on her father’s missing persons case, now Murder Detective McCann. She plays on his ego and feigns hero worship to get him to spill stories about he past cases. Eventually he tells the story of her father, how they found him in England with his younger lover, but that he didn’t tell the wife because she was too delicate and he saved her from the blow of knowing the truth. Aislinn is furious that a cop could hold that much power and make a decision that changed the trajectory of her and her mother’s lives so callously. She decides to seduce him, get him to leave his wife and family, and then dump him - ruining his life like he did hers. But she wasn’t counting on meeting someone else, Rory. While she is preparing for a visit from Rory, McCann drops by unexpectedly and is surprised to hear her tell him that it is over. In anger, he hits her, she falls and fractures her skull. Then he and his partner, Breslin, begin the cover up by lying to their boss, getting Breslin assigned to the case where he tries to lead Conway and Moran down dead ends. I highly recommend this one to those who love police procedurals."
"Man, I love Tana French.

I'm not a huge mystery fan overall, but when I do delve into mysteries, I like them dark and gritty and real, and French definitely delivers there. I remember picking up Into the Woods on a whim, and being absolutely blown away. Then, last year, during an audiobook draught, The Secret Place called out to me. When I saw The Tresspasser galley was available, I knew I needed to get my hands on it.

The most exciting part about The Tresspasser initially is the return of Steven Moran, who was the protagonist of The Secret Place. I adored him then, and I adore him still. It was exciting to have him present, but to see things through the eyes of his partner, Antionette Conway, who was also his partner in The Secret Place. Conway was a bit of an enigma in the last book, and clearly struggling against some of the members of the murder squad, so it was nice to get into her head for this one.

I feel like The Tresspasser was just so perfectly executed. It wasn't a fast-paced thriller, but the more leisurely pace I think actually served the book really well. The slower pace reflected Conway and Moran's struggles to make sense of the case -- even though they could sense something off from the start, it took them awhile (and numerous theories) to figure out what. It was great to see the puzzle pieces click into place, first very slowly, and then much more quickly towards the end.

Getting the story from Conway's perpsective also made for a unique read. This book was so much about the stories people tell themselves, and Conway herself is not immune to that. She finds herself at a crossroads of sorts, and there were certainly times that she felt unreliable as a narrator. It was clear to me, the reader, that things couldn't possibly be the way Conway herself was imagining them at times, and yet.... Conway's perspective was what we had.

I just think French is brilliant, and I just loved the story from beginning to end. The end brought things so beautifully full circle, and was immensely satisfying. The Tresspasser solidified French as one of my favorite authors."
"This is the sixth novel by Tana French about the Dublin Murder Squad, and it is a very good one. Antoinette Conway, the only woman on the squad, is constantly being harassed by her fellow squad members, and she has developed a tough outer demeanor as well as somewhat of a chip on her shoulder. And then the squad leader comes in just as she is finishing a report late at night and drops another apparent domestic violence murder case on her desk. Only this time, there is no open and shut answer as to what happened to young Aislinn Murray, reported as in need of an ambulance, by a mysterious caller. It turns out that Aislinn is dead, her body found in her home, appearing as if she fell, hitting her head (until the investigators find that she had been punched extremely hard in the jaw area). Antoinette and her partner, Stephen Moran, start to think that perhaps Aislinn had a secret romance with a gangland criminal due to the true crime and books about gangland murders on her bookshelf. Other than this, Aislinn is an enigma. There is very little in her home that tells an observer anything at all about her personality, family, passions, etc. In fact it appears that she was inventing herself day by day. Antoinette has a very sharp memory, and she recognizes Aislinn from somewhere in her past. It is that recognition that begins to turn the key to open the door as to what really happened to this young woman."
"Tana French has drawn an excellent character in Antoinette Conway. She is a very tough detective on the Dublin murder squad but through harassment from the other male squad members she is becoming very paranoid. Along with her partner, Steve Moran, she struggles to find the solution to the murder of Aislinn Murray. French writes with such detail she gives us an opportunity to see and feel what it's like to be a member of the murder squad. Her writing is excellent and she does get wordy but she takes you on a complex, emotional and suspenseful ride like no other. This is the 6th book in the series and in order to get the full impact of her characters, it's best to start with the 1st book, In The Woods, and see how her writing progresses. I'm looking forward to her next book and I would highly recommend this series to those people who like complex murder mysteries.
4.5 stars"
"This book really resonated with me due to the story of the protagonist which was relatable, authentic and hit close to home.

I was very surprised to find myself liking our protagonist Conway after I already put the label ""Annoying"" on her (she was introduced as a side character in ""The Secret Place""). However, now I think she's one of my favorite book characters I've read so far. Her decline to become a paranoid pessimist felt believable and a lot of the problems she's facing at the workplace can be projected to ""real life"". Her Interactions with other characters were hilarious and very uncomfortable at the same time... I couldn't get enough of it.

Speaking of other characters: They were intriguing as expected from Tana French. The mystery was good too and distinct from the previous novels in the series.

A thoroughly enjoyable read!"
"Tana French is a master. She delves into people's personalities, observations, motives and imperfections. And, she wraps it all into police procedurals and mysteries. Each book unfolds until you don't know what to think and this book is no different. Antoinette Conway, the lead in this book, is so complex and so competent and yet you see her flaws. French just gets better with every book
(although I wasn't a fan of Secret Place since whinging, angsty high school girls are so not my thing) and I love the loose interconnectedness throughout the series. I need to make the time to do a re-read of her earlier works since I read each as they were published."
"Absolutely my favorite of the DMS series. Antoinette and Stephen are perfect— they had me in stitches half the time and in tears the other half. The case is unbelievably complicated and dense, but in classic Tana French style, the moment the answer is revealed it feels inevitable. I loved Aislinn and Lucy and the glimpses we get of their friendship. It honestly feels like everything from In The Woods onward was leading to this, especially comparing Rob and Cassie as partners to Antoinette and Stephen. It feels right that it ended like this. And if Tana ends up writing more A+S as The Best Murder D’s The World Has Ever Seen... I’m not complaining. "
"Duet Conway - Steve mungkin yang paling likeable dari semua karakter di seri ini (tapi Cooper is still my #1 ^^). Duet mereka berlanjut setelah The Secret Place dan meski kali ini Conway yang leading, she didn't overshadowing Steve's character.

Kasusnya... ini yang paling gemes, karena meski semua teori, analisa, kesaksian sudah menunjuk ke pelaku tapi tetap bisa dipatahkan karena tidak ada hard evidence dan pengakuan. Dan perang psikologi di bagian akhirnya itu so intense!
"
"Peerless
Tana French is in a class of her own. Her characters are fully fleshed out individuals with flaws and fears that avoid the usual police procedural/detective cliches yet also serve to make them highly relatable. Throughout the Murder Squad series, French effortlessly conveys the rich interior lives of her main protagonists and this offering is no exception. Her use of language creates a rhythm that plays out with both beauty and tension. A true literary crime thriller. Superb."
"I can't believe it, but I think it beat out The Likeness for my favourite of the series. It's a lot more difficult to read than The Likeness, it might be even more complex than Broken Harbour. I'm sure a lot of people are going to say (or have said) that Antoinette is unlikable, but whatever."
"Książka idealna dla tych, którzy nadają na tych samych falach co Tana French. To znaczy, że jest w niej jeszcze więcej gdybania, gadania, zastanawiania się i rozważania opcji niż w poprzednich książkach. Nie znajdziecie tu pościgów, strzelania i seryjnych morderców, a i tak będziecie obgryzac paznokcie z emocji."
"May be Tana French's best book yet. I did not want to put this down!! Listen to the audio for the brogue but don't kid yourself, you'll need the kindle / hardcover, too. There is not a better rogue cop writer out there. This genre just doesn't get any better! Plus, Dublin Murder Squad. "
"Tana French is one of my favorite writers. I love her stories, even as they twist me up in anxiety. That said, this was the first time when I really hated a character. However, I chose to trust French and pushed through--and I'm glad that I did."
I do not know if she is getting better or I am growing to appreciate her more. She has become one of my new favorites. This one kept me guessing until almost the very end. Hope she keeps writing. Makes the loss of P.D. and Ruth a bit easier to handle.
"

My second favorite in the series. I enjoyed it almost as much as the first book."
"This was one of the most satisfying Dublin Murder Squad books I've read. The character interactions are awesome, the twists are fantastic, and it's a great balance between far-fetched and throughly planned out."
"Conway and Steve were a great combination and the Murder Squad is alive and well. Nice to revisit this pair, Antoinette and Steve. The squad who always has your back, or does it? And a sweet innocent girl, Aislinn. Or is she?"
Absolutely brilliant. Getting the arc for this title was the treat of my week. So many twists and turns - might be my favorite so far.
"Excellent, as always. Review coming."
Come for the intriguing mystery and the excellent character development; stay for the pervasive paranoia and the revenge fantasies. 
Another enjoyable mystery by Tana French. Full review here: http://spooklights.blogspot.com/2016/...
couldn't stop reading it. well written. reasonably twisty. made me feel emotionally icky.
"Simply brilliant. Had no idea how she would wrap it up, and didn’t see the ending coming, French at the top of her game."
"I knew Conway, to see anyway before she was famous. Back in training college, she was two years behind me. Tall girl, hair scraped back hard. Built like a runner, long limbs, long muscles. Chin always high, shoulders always back. A lot of guys buzzed round Conway, her first week: just trying to help her settle in, nice to be friendly, nice to be nice, just coincidence that the girls who didn’t look the same didn’t get the same. Whatever she said to the boys, after the first week they stopped giving her come-ons. They gave her shite instead.


That, right there is the first thing we hear about Antoinette Conway. From the very start you know, she’s a badass. She will not be taking anyone’s shite. She’s there to work. Not to cuddle or make friends.

I have to say, I was a bit let down by the last book, The Secret Place . A lot didn’t work for me. What did work for me were the detectives, Antoinette Conway, and Stephen Moran. Going into this book, knowing that I was going to have 464 pages inside Conway was a delight.

And boy, does Tana French Deliver!
You get your in-depth character study of Conway. You get what makes her click. Her demons. Why she has put on the tough woman persona. You get all that as well as a nut crushing murder mystery.

I’m telling you! There are so MANY ways this could have gone wrong. French could have really gone overboard with Feminism and turned Conway into an actual Man-hating bitch. This book could have so easily been about the evil men of murder squad going after Antoinette Conway. And her glories heroine’s journey overcoming all those sexist evil men. Instead, we’re shown a human side into her psyche. French shows us that the world doesn’t tick as Antoinette sees it. There aren’t Men hiding in bushes waiting to have the jump on her.

It took me only 5 days. And I don’t have to tell you that 464 pages are a lot. I usually try to avoid long books. Not everyone can keep the reader hooked and not turn the book into a drag.
The Trespasser had me hooked. From the moment Conway and Moran walk into that crime scene. I was ready to spend my whole day reading this. The plot flows very smoothly. I really can’t remember a single part where I was bored or I was going, Yeah, can we please go back to that other stuff? I was invested in Conway as much as I was invested in the Victim’s story.
There are long scenes of characters standing and just talking. Arguing. Interviewing. I didn’t find a single one of them dull or boring. Writing convincing dialogue and interactions is not EASY!

I wonder what makes a book, good? That secret ingredient. What is it? What made this book click so well for me?

It really never stops to amaze me how French is able to create so many complex and unique characters in each book. The Trespasser is the sixth book in her series. By book six, even I was expecting something familiar. Something on the lines of what we have already seen. A formulaic approach perhaps. Some variation of a previous detective recycled into someone new. But, NO! Rob, Cassie, Frank, Scorcher, Stephen, and Antoinette are six very different characters. With different motivations and demons.



I’m no newbie reader. I have read before there was ever a murder squad and I will be reading after it. There are only a number of reasons why an author actually ever bothers to write. Some do it to make a buck, some do it because well, it’s their job, some do it to keep their brand alive, some do it to meet a deadline. AND some do it because they actually want to SAY something with their words. Some do it because they actually want to tell A goddamn story.


French takes her time with her books. In the woods came out in 2007 or something, She has published a book every 2-3 years ever since. No short stories. Or let’s rush the next book, while this one still hot . NO!

One thing French does in this book which I absolutely loved, was putting very subtle references to her previous books. Nothing to take you out of the story. You won’t even notice it unless you have been with her from the very start. Like Conway mentions,

The rumours say I got this gig because O’Kelly needed to tick the token boxes and I tick two for the price of one – and those are the nice rumours. All of them are bullshit. When the gaffer brought me on board, he was down a D – one of his top guys had just put in his papers early – and I was Missing Persons’ shining star, waving a sheaf of fancy high-profile solves in each hand.

Which is a clear reference to Scorcher Kennedy from book Five. Sam and Frank were also referenced.

As of now, this is the last Murder Squad book. And considering that the next book, The Witch Elm, is standalone. I really wonder if this going be to it.
I would like the next one to be about O’Kelly. The gaffer who has run the Murder Squad for 20 something years. It would be interesting.

"
"And I'm done. I have just finished this book, after sitting on the couch for a few hours being glued to the page. I was very much looking forward to reading The Trespasser because I absolutely loved the way that Moran and Conway worked together in The Secret Place. Needless to say, I really freaking loved The Trespasser.
As always, I find that Tana French writes a really interesting movie, while also diving deep into the main character's head and the book becomes this psychological police procedure and I really do love those. So, I felt like I had to take my time with this book because it just felt so intense. You're in Conway's head this time and there is so much going on in there, and I also felt that so many of the characters in this book were focused around building stories and spending a lot of time inside their own heads which is something I enjoy doing so I felt myself really connecting with one of the suspects just because I really connected with him and I hoped that he wasn't the guy.
The mystery of this one kept me hanging on the edge of my seat right up until the last 3/4 of the book when things started to slide into place, and I was so blown away and a little shocked by how everything went down. I don't know that I have much else to say at this point, because having just finished the book, I'm still processing my feelings for this book.
But I do know that I love The Trespasser. That being said, Broken Harbour is still my favourite book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I genuinely hope that Tana French goes back to the Dublin Murder Squad series because the way that things ended in The Trespasser has me wanting to know more about what happens to the squad next."
"Welp, that was a fast twelve hours. On a Monday night. That's how good this is. I haven't read 450 pages in a single day...ever, maybe, and even for this author, haven't been kept up half the night reading since In the Woods. Against stiff competition, this might be her best book, though I'm not sure my loyalty to the beauty that is In the Woods will ever totally shift.

Conway and Moran. I knew this partnership was going to be good, and it was. I'm already excited to reread the book--all of Tana French's books stand up incredibly well to rereading--and the little bits and bobs of this relationship I know will emerge is a big reason why. Stephen Moran is a character best located by triangulation, I think. He was a fascinating minor character in Faithful Place, but I was not very satisfied with what we learned about him as the narrator of The Secret Place; he is a reserved character, even when we're inside his head. I feel like we get more of him through Conway's eyes, and through his own reactions to what happens in this book, than we got in his own book. French could probably keep writing about him and he would continue to evolve and be revealed, but she won't, because that's not her M.O. FINE. In a related story, where's my Sam O'Neill book?? ::waves at Sam during his fleeting appearance in the background of the squad room::

I don't know how French does it, but she creates a whole environment of fun-house mirrors and shoves you in there with Conway, baffled as to what is real and what is your own imagination, and terrified that you might have to give up because you'll never figure it out. Part of it might be that a friend recently pointed out a concrete example I had missed (in no less than probably a dozen readings!) of Rob Ryan being an unreliable narrator in In the Woods, and it made me trust myself less as a reader--plus I was definitely skimming this one in parts, so I knew I might be missing things. Nevertheless, the skill with which French has Conway weave her own web of confusion is incredible to behold. There is no way out of this book but through--hence, my do-not-pass-into-sleep reading of it.

There are some aspects of Conway that stick out funny, but I've never met a character that cares less. Calling up her mom and talking over case details, given her history with her mother: huh? A character from the past appears and Conway shrugs and sends them away: really? She knows exactly what she's going to decide in any one moment, and is unapologetic about her actions--and it might be that, there, that ultimately gets her caught in her own mind, and the recognition of it that lets her get out. She's a wicked smart one. There was a chunk of this book where I thought I had read her totally wrong in The Secret Place, but I think I got her right in the end.

There are not as many strong female archetypes in fiction as I wish there were, or I should say that a lot of strong female characters feel like they fall into a similar mold. While both Cassie Maddox (from The Likeness) and Conway are strong characters, they are quite different from each other, and from what you usually get in female narrators. Cassie is as steel as Conway, but far more socially adept and comfortable with it. They'd either get along like a house on fire, or not at all. Even some of her secondary female characters, Sophie the tech (In the Woods and this one) and Abby Stone (The Likeness), are strong in a fictionally atypical way.

I loved - LOVED - how French handled, or didn't handle, Conway's romantic life. She's always written emotionally intense and physically vague romance scenes, when she writes them at all, which I find perfect. We find out very, very little about Conway's personal life, and who she lets in. 
I thought there was a hint of a history with Sophie, as well as one with Fleas. There might've been more there that I missed in my sprint through this book, and I hope there is, but even if there isn't, I'm satisfied with what I learned. Most single women in literature have to be defined in how they feel and about whom, but Conway gets to keep that for herself. The more I think about this aspect of the character, the more I love how it was done. Bravo.

Extreme amounts of Irish slang here, and spelling craic as ""crack"" drove me a little batty, though the interwebs tell me it can go either way-- craic being the proper Irish spelling of a term that was originally English, per that unimpeachable source, Wikipedia. American editors, we the people can figure out craic in a book set in Ireland, so don't translate down to us. It's like when they temporarily changed ""Mum"" to ""Mom"" in the Harry Potter books. You can take the ""u"" out of ""ou"" words, but don't touch the proper names and untranslatable terms, because then everything rings false. There's a line. Stay on that side. (Why yes, I AM a Virgo grammar/language nerd! Sure to make mistakes, but will stand stubbornly on what I know anyway.)

O'Kelly! I forgot about this. It was another shining subplot of the book. We've been hearing for books upon books that O'Kelly is smarter and more perceptive than he presents himself, and never has that been more obvious than here. Beginning authors, this is how you write erstwhile minor characters with serious depth.

I so want the next book to be about Fleas. I heard a podcast interview with her, and I'm sorry to say she sounded a little unsure about her next book. It sounded like she was really trying to make it work as narrated by a witness to a crime. Don't do it, girl. Fleas wants to narrate!

Good lord, I could keep writing for paragraphs on the various aspects of this book. But I won't--there's plenty of great reviews on here and everyone has covered a bit for themselves, so in the end all the layers get looked at."
"French's best since Faithful Place. Conway and Morin, whom we met in The Secret Place, catch the murder of a young woman who recently did a radical makeover of her life. Why? Why does the detective assigned to assist them so badly want it to be an open-and-shut case of a new boyfriend getting too intense too fast? And does her murder have anything to do with her father's disappearance twenty years ago?

Conway is the narrator, and she learns as much about herself as she does about the victim, the killer, and his friends. Her own transformation -- and Morin's, to a lesser degree -- are as interesting as the main plot.

Like Faithful Place, The Trespasser is well-plotted, though there aren't a lot of theories or suspects -- turns out that isn't necessary, if the ones we're given are good ones. (I'll confess to having never quite understood what happened in French's Broken Harbor, or why.) The setting is strong and the atmosphere believable. I listened to the audio, and although there were a few times when the change in who was speaking wasn't immediately obvious, I believed this narrator *was* Antonette Conway. Highly recommended."
"Reading Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books satisfies my every need for a great storytelling, psychological thrills, and characters who have to face and work through emotional baggage to get to the bottom of the murder case they are tasked with solving. ""The Trespasser"" features French's driving internal psychological explorations again, this time in Detective Antoinette Conway, who is tasked with solving a seemingly cut-and-dried domestic murder case with her new partner, Steven Moran. As with every book in this series, the case drove my compulsion to race through the book, but the best writing in my book appears Conway plumbs the depths of her own psychological damage and starts to crack her home-grown hard-boiled protective shell. Conways relationship with Moran feels honest and hopeful, even as she becomes increasingly overwhelmed by her sense of being ostracized by the rest of the squad. ""The Trespasser"" calls on us to examine the stories we tell ourselves and others and peel back the affect to see that sometimes life isn't as complicated as we build it up to be."
"This is a solid entry in the Dublin Murder Squad series, although still nothing competes with my beloved Faithful Place, which I personally feel is the best in the series. (I know that is not the popular opinion.) But this was classic French, great description and ambient details, fully fleshed out conversations, and an interior monologue for our main character that really fleshes out her story.

I know French has a theater background, and you can really see that in her writing. She is dressing the set with all of the right elements and weaving them into the story. She captures dialect perfectly, and I realized with this book that she lets the whole scene play out. She's not leaving out aspects of the scene for brevity. You get the whole scene, moment to moment.

I know some of her non-murder squad books have been met with mixed reviews, but I for one am going to have to read those, too. I can see why she would want to do something different, while at the same time I'm sad that this is the last in the series. I do hope we get more."
"I'm still thinking about this one, but I think it's my current fave of the six thus far in the series. Antoinette reminds me of a harder-edged Cass, for starters, and the way her character is developed in this one makes me mourn anew the opportunities missed in The Secret Place. There were a few places where the pace perhaps dragged a little (isn't there always in these books?), but—unlike in some of the other books—I feel like those slower spots were necessary for character development. French's books are always a master class, I think, in developing and deconstructing characters, but this one felt like a step up even compared to the others.

[5 stars for the inherent need to devour the story (I read it in a day, when I should have been working), for the development and deconstruction of her characters, and for this suspicion I'll re-read it before returning it to the library—both because I want to and to get a better sense for how some of the pieces work.]"
"And just like that, the Dublin Murder Squad comes to an end. There is a part of me that wishes I could feel angry or let down but the ending was perfect. I feel I know every character like they were old friends, some I didn't even like but couldn't help but love. The Trespasser brought me closer to Steve and Antonette and unlike some of French's stories, I feel like they were better off at the end than the start. This one really examined perspective and how that feeds or hinders relationships. It kept me guessing and wouldn't let me trust a single character. It was compelling and poignant to the very end."
"Inside out

Antoinette Conway and her partner on the Murder Squad, Steve Moran have a wild ride in solving a murder. Most of the action takes place in their dialogue: his is mostly external, hers is both external and internal. It is all about what is really true, and what is biased by perception. In this, Conway is able to grow, revealing her strength as a person, as a Guarda. A solid read."
"Tana back in my good books. This and Faithful are top shite. Step above all others for me, absolutely gorgeous. Spent about 1.5hrs just crushing to see the end. And I might have wanted to see it all blow up, but she leaves some things for imagination. Anyhow, grand book, might even grab what else she has there."
"I read and loved the rest of this series a few years ago, well before I started this account. I would probably read more mysteries if more mysteries were like this one: less about the whodunit details and more about the human psyche. Couldn’t put it down."
THIS WAS SO GOOD.
"The audio book is AMAZING. Get it, get it now."
LOVED this! Tana French is the best! Cannot wait for her next. 
My favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries! Excellent! 
Loved this - was truly interested in the mystery. 
How does Ms. French do this?I went down a dozen rabbit holes happily misjudged all the major players and at the end it all seemed the one and only ending... a complete surprise!!!Always looking to the next Tana French novel for a unique and riveting reading experience! 
"I gave this one a 4.5 star rating, but that's only because it has the misfortune of being compared to other books in this series. Individually, they're all 5 stars apiece and I'm heartbroken to be done."
4.5 stars
This is an impressive author. Each time I read one of her books I am impressed all over again. Her vocabulary is colorful land her plots are complex. They are however so well constructed that I never lose the storyline. Her characters are well developed and jump off the page at you. I didn’t mean to start with the last book in the series but the offer on Bookbub was too attractive to turn down.
"4.5 Stars

Tana French did it again."
"Tana French has really cracked the code for series books by alternating first person singular main characters. The basic Dublin squad can change, the perspective can change with a fresh viewpoint and character for each new entry in the series. In this one Antoinette Conway provides a different view of life indeed."
"Working in Dublin's murder squad is not as glamorous as Antoinette Conway anticipated. Instead of getting intriguing murder cases, she is working the late night shift where the cases are mainly domestics and drunks. To top it off the squad is close minded and they are not happy with having a black female on their squad. Early one morning, Antoinette is handed the murder case of Aislinn Murray and everything changes. French takes the reader on a wild ride with several red herrings. The Irish jargon and slang is off putting, but French's mystery is worth being drawn into. "
So well written and engaging I don't mind in the least I did absolutely nothing but read all weekend. I want more...
"LOVED this detective and her biting wit. The narration was superb. The story was engaging and interesting. Writing was refreshing. I cannot wait to read more from Tana French and more of the Dublin Murder Squad.
This was my first read of the Dublin Murder Squad and about half way through I discovered it was book 6 of a series. I would never have guessed. It could be a stand alone."
"Loved it. The pacing seemed strange at first because of the nature of the case, but then it came together in a way that was SO satisfying. Once again, very impressed with Tana French."
I'll miss you toni
I really enjoyed this one.
"As always, Tana French puts together a great read. Totally hooked. Loved the main character so strong, love how she talks to her mother. Great dialogue. It was Grand."
"I find it kind of ironic that I built it up in my mind that this was going to be one of my less favorite Tana French books, because it ended up being one of my favorites, and that’s kind of the whole theme of the book. Anyways, Tana French writes melancholy so well that I don’t want to do anything now that I’ve finished this.

(Also I like that this is probably the last Dublin Murder Squad book because it feels so reminiscent of In The Woods with the two main characters/ their working relationship.)"
"The Dublin Murder Squad is a fantastic series, and The Trespasser is one of the best installments. It's stellar from start to finish. I devoured it, and now I'm just sad because it's over. It's that great.

One reason I'm sad to be finished with The Trespasser is because I loved the narrator so much. Antoinette Conway is the star of this book. We met her in The Secret Place, where she was teamed up with Stephen Moran. (
I love them together. I can't even.) Now it's time for Antoinette's story. Antoinette is tough-as-nails; she takes no shit. And it's a good thing she's like that, because aside from the usual struggles of being a Murder detective, as a woman of color on an all-male squad, she deals with a constant barrage of racism and misogyny. The harassment from her co-workers is so bad that she's thinking of quitting the job she always dreamed of. At work, her partner Stephen is the only one who has her back. They're the dream team; he's easy-going and charming to balance out her no-nonsense attitude. Their partnership is very realistic compared to some pairings (*cough* Rob and Cassie *cough*). I love Antoinette because she's a total BAMF; I wish I could be like her. I felt her struggle like, I see you, Antoinette. I feel you. And I love Stephen because he's a ray of sunshine but he also has hidden depths, and I've been rooting for him since Faithful Place. And together? Antoinette and Stephen's dynamic blows me away. If any characters from this series deserve a TV show, it's these two. It would just work so well.

The Trespasser revolves around around a case that should have been a slam-dunk for Antoinette and Stephen. It's seems to be a domestic, the only kind of case they ever pull, because God forbid Antoinette, the squad pariah, get a high-profile or exciting case. Aislinn (pronounced Ash-lynn, which I totally mispronounced in my head for two-thirds of the book until a character referred to her as Ash and I looked up a pronunciation video—there I saved you the trouble) Murray has been found murdered in her home. The victim is dolled up like Barbie and her apartment was set up for a dinner date with her new boyfriend. Said boyfriend must be the perp—right? Instead of finding easy answers, Antoinette and Stephen uncover a spiral of conspiracy, revenge, and false appearances during their investigation. And things get personal when Antoinette realizes she has a stalker and someone's out to get her more relentlessly than before.

This is a twisty-turny mystery that will keep you turning the pages until you hurtle to the conclusion. I will brag that at 50% through the book, my status was: ""Think I just figured out the whole book. We'll see if I'm right!"" I was totally right. I'm a good guesser. But reading a Tana French novel is still infinitely enjoyable to me even if I guess the ending. The journey is so great—I love the procedural details and seeing how the leads arrive at their conclusions. The process fascinates me and The Trespasser is a helluva ride. The writing is also beautiful, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and sometimes poignantly sad. The Trespasser is a novel of thematic heft, with several beautifully explored themes. And as always, Tana French has an uncanny knack for revealing the many facets of human nature. I said earlier how I want an Antoinette/Stephen show. The Tresspasser also felt very cinematic. I could see this one as a film.

Read all of the Dublin Murder Squad if you haven't. Then read this superb installment. Then we can all fangirl/fanboy over the awesomeness that is this series. Man oh man, I loved this one so much. Tana French is my queen.

Also: 
I know this would break with the format of the series (new hero/heroine for each installment) but I totally wish Tana French would just continue the adventures of Antoinette and Stephen. They are the most beloved of her detectives for me, and it would be a shame for this to be the end of reading about their baller partnership. So please, Ms. French: just alternate books between Antoinette and Stephen's POVs. Then they can have that TV series about them."
This booked picked me up and wouldn't put me down!
Maybe more like 4.5? Incredible mystery but could have been 100 pages shorter. Great writing. 
"dang, tana! I liked this a lot more than The Secret Place. Also, why has her next book not even been announced? For some reason I always end up reading these awhile after they come out, yet I'm still mad that the next one is nowhere in sight. I can't even properly explain the way her writing makes me feel. She is the best at portraying the angst that lies just below the surface of life that is so difficult to put into words. "
"Another brilliant book in the series, up there with my favourites, The Likeness and Faithful Place. French's writing is fantastic, and I'm gutted that this appears to be the last in the series."
"Full disclosure--I read this in less than 24 hours while on vacation and hated that it was over so soon. Every Tana French book I pick up--every single one--I begin it thinking I can't possibly be as interested in her new POV character as the previous one. And every single time she proves me wrong. Antoinette Conway, lead detective on what appears to be a simple domestic violence murder, is perhaps French's finest creation since Cassie Maddox and Rob Ryan. In fact, to assuage my desire for more, I've picked up Cassie's book, The Likeness, to read again."
"Tana French is a fantastic writer. She's strong on atmosphere, threat and place. She pulls you into the plot and then challenges you to get it right. In each book - and this is the sixth that I've read but the first I've reviewed - she creates a claustrophobic sense of events before the connections are finally made. This book is true to form. Recommended.
"
"Just because Antoinette is paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get her. We first met this novel’s protagonist, Antoinette Conway, in Tana French’s most recent book, The Secret Place where she and her now partner Stephen Moran, were investigating a murder at an all-girls school. Most of the action in that book happened in the course of one day “on location” at the school, but this novel’s action takes place over a number of days, and largely in and around the Murder Squad’s office in Dublin Castle. In that setting, we see the subtle and not as subtle sexism and acts of sabotage that Antoinette has been facing during her tenure in the Murder Squad. People are taking parts of her witness statements, hampering her cases and causing tons of unnecessary re-work. People are making snide remarks, peeing in her locker, and she can’t ever leave her coffee on her desk for fear of what will end up in it. This is awful, and yet, completely believable.

In this setting, this environment where the only person Conway can trust is her partner Moran, all of the action is coming from Conway’s perspective. That is exhausting. It is truly a lot of work to be so suspicious of so many people all the time. That is a full time job, in addition to, you know, solving murders. It is so well done, Antoinette is a real person. And as a bonus, reading from Conway’s perspective is so funny, as she has a sense of humor in her own head, even if she doesn’t let it show. Her internal monologue had me smiling along, but maybe I can identify with her more than prior protagonists in this series.

Then there is the paranoia. Is the senior detective, Breslin, who has also been put on this case because he’s “good with witnesses” trying to help them along for their own good? Or does he have his own agenda? Are they being steered towards the boyfriend because he’s guilty? Or because something else is going on? Why did they get assigned this case in the first place – at the very end of their shift, when they should actually have been heading out for a pint? I can’t say much more without getting into spoiler territory, so you’ll have to read it. Yes, go get a copy, and read it. What are you waiting for? Or listen to it, as the audiobook is quite good.

I’ve enjoyed all of Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad mysteries, but this one is my favorite. I’ve read most of them in audiobook, including this one, and although the books are all great, they are long. Sometimes my mind wanders and I need to go back and catch up. That didn’t happen once in this book, even though the book is almost 500 pages and the audiobook 21 hours. I’m actually re-listening to the last chapter now, just for more details. It’s that good.

"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I could use this book for one of the prompts in the 2017 PopSugar Reading Challenge (a book with a red spine), so I was able to check off one more category when I finished this one. I absolutely love this series, which is more like a set of stand-alone novels featuring a different member of the Dublin Murder Squad. Some characters appear in multiple books, but you can easily pick up any of them and start anywhere in the series. This one focuses on Detective Antoinette Conway, who is an outsider on the old boys' network-like squad and is seriously considering leaving to pursue other career options. Closing one last case is what she believes she needs to do to make that change. The case she is assigned deals with a striking young woman, Aislinn Murray, who is found murdered in her home. Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran (who was the detective featured in The Secret Place), are assigned the case, with Conway being the lead. She cannot shake the feeling that she has seen the victim before, though. A more senior detective offers his services to help the two close the case, which is receiving a great deal of press coverage and pressure to quickly close the case. As Conway and Moran investigate, it soon becomes clear that a dangerous game of cat and mouse is underway. Do these two outsiders have what it takes to outwit the forces working against them, or will they have to compromise themselves to bring closure to this case?

As is the case with other books in this series, the psychological tension is palpable and the reader is left wondering just as much as Conway who can be trusted and what really happened the night Aislinn was killed. The author's plotting and writing are exquisite and masterful. The characters are always richly drawn, complex, and flawed -- and deeply human; the storylines riveting. While much of the violence happens offscreen, the stories tend to be gritty, as would be expected with a series centering on a police unit investigating murders. However, the stories are more about the relationships of the detectives at their core and complexities of when personal and professional lives collide. Each new offering in the series never fails to hold my attention from the moment I pick up the book until I close the cover as I finish the last page. I continue to be blown away by this series, and look forward to each new offering, being left simultaneously satisfied and wanting more when I finish the novel."
"This one may be the best of the series. Ms. French's depth of character is never better than in exploring both the victim's pathology and that of the police woman trying to solve the murder. Antoinette Conway is her most complicated character since Rob Ryan in the first book. Her partner, Stephen, who I loved in the previous book, again comes off as one of my favorite characters in the series. Conway is the ""I"" on this book, though, and seeing things through her eyes leaves us wondering how she's going to survive in the pressure cooker of the Murder Squad as an outcast, a black woman who is routinely harassed by her fellow detectives. Or is she? This is a wonderful book with some of the most insightful interrogation scenes I've ever experienced and a great exploration of professional relationships."
"2016 was a shit year, no doubt about it. But perhaps the least shitty thing to come out of it was my love of Tana French. I won’t even apologize for gushing about her so much guys. If you haven’t read her books, you can’t understand. I read her first book way back in January and finished up her last one in December. It’s a tough call, but The Trespasser is the best of the bunch and that’s really saying something. Reallllllly saying something. I don’t give out a lot of true 5 star ratings, but this one deserved it.

The Trespasser revisits detective Antoinette Conway with a mystery that will keep you guessing right up until the end. We learned in The Secret Place that Conway is a bit prickly with a chip on her shoulder. To be fair, her attitude and outlook on life is understandable. It’s not easy growing up mixed race in Ireland and being the only woman on the Murder Squad. She’s a great detective who rose through the ranks quickly, but she just can’t catch a break as a murder detective. At least she finally got a partner she likes and works well with, Stephen Moran.

The two of them work a lot of night shifts and get a lot of domestic murders as the youngest detectives on the squad. They’ve just worked a long night and are about to head home when they’re given another murder that looks like another run of the mill domestic squabble gone bad. Aislinn Murray is a pretty blonde found dead in her apartment. The place was set for a romantic dinner for two so the murder must have been committed by the boyfriend right? Unfortunately things don’t fall so neatly into place. The two of them have been assigned a seasoned detective to “help” them with the case and he’s pushing to have the boyfriend charged, but Conway and Moran aren’t so sure the facts fit. They’re already on the outs with the rest of the squad so relationships start to turn sour when they push back.

French made Conway her most fascinating character yet. Conway has reason to be paranoid but the case and her relationships with the other detectives take the paranoia up a couple of notches. She’s an unreliable narrator and you can’t quite tell if she’s being reasonable or if the paranoia is unwarranted.

The Trespasser is everything I ever wanted in a mystery and I have serious doubts that anyone, even French herself, can top this one."
"When Irish Crime/Thriller author Tana French emerged on the scene with her first novel, IN THE WOODS, she instantly became an international sensation.

She has written 5 other novels since that one and the latest is THE TRESPASSER. My personal favorite of hers is the unbearably suspenseful THE LIKENESS which should be made into a film. Each one of her novels features different Detectives from the Dublin Murder Squad. THE TRESPASSER is all about the fairly new Detective duo of Antoinette Conway and Stephan Moran.

They have the opportunity to sink or swim with a real puzzler of a murder case. A young and very attractive woman named Aislinn Murray is found beaten to death in her own kitchen. There are not a lot of suspects so the focus immediately falls on her new boyfriend, the somewhat twitchy book store owner, Rory Fallon.

The more senior Detectives are putting a lot of pressure on Conway and Moran to close this case and one of them, the overbearing Detective Breslin, even inserts himself into the various interrogations of Rory Fallon. Even though no other suspect is found, Conway and Moran cannot bring themselves to laying the crime on Fallon as they are unable to find any motive other than his time-line for the life of Aislinn's murder being a bit off.

This is where Tana French and her masterful use of plotting and prose take over as the final third of this novel is a roller-coaster ride with one mind-blowing revelation after another. I cannot remember the last time I have been so glued to my seat when reading the depiction of a suspects interrogation as I have in this one. It reminded me of an episode of one of my all-time favorite crime shows, ""Homicide"". Tana French is always essential reading for me and whenever she releases a new book it immediately becomes the 'next' book on my to be read pile. If you have not yet gotten the chance to enjoy her do yourself a favor and pick up IN THE WOODS and read your way through to THE TRESPASSER. You won't regret it!"
"I was glad to see more of Antoinette and Stephen. I liked their partnership in the last book, and getting to see her story was very interesting. You can sort of tell that she's getting a bit paranoid, but from her viewpoint it seems there is good reason. But she spends more time on her cases then on trying to figure out how to work with her squad, and so it's maybe not surprising that she misses a lot of social dynamics. She's combative and defensive and distant and I liked her anyway. Probably because of her soft spot for Stephen, even though she seems to have misjudged him a bit, too.

Antoinette makes some strange decisions throughout the book. Not confronting or reporting her harassers. Her strange confrontation with a man stalking her house. Her interaction with Fleas. Going to talk to a reporter before she talks to her boss. Her decisions to talk to or avoid Breslin at various times. She is back and forth between being willing to explore 'what ifs' in investigations and her personal life and then shutting those down completely. And her nonexistant personal life, for that matter.

The whole murder of Aislinn story is a weird one. Not only because it isn't the open and shut case they think it is in the beginning (which we know it won't be if it's going to fill a whole book!). And in the beginning they see her as a Barbie doll with a Martha Stewart home. But Aislinn's backstory is convoluted and her motivation for her personal change is bizarre. As are her very limited relationships.

The investigation does seem like it drags out, but really, the whole things takes place over a few days. There isn't a lot of lost time that gets skipped over, and I kind of like that we see it playing out in nearly real time.

There are a lot of strange things going on in the book. But I'm not a big fan of traditional mysteries, so I was willing to overlook a few things to get a mystery book that I enjoy. And I almost always enjoy Tana French. Although I do need my sleep, I'm always glad to pick up a book that I don't want to put down."
"Tana French is true to form in this wonderfully riveting 6th book in the Dublin murder series. Featuring Antoinette Conway (a character that first appeared in the previous book ""The Secret Place"") as the main protagonist along with Stephen Moran as her partner, ""The Trespasser"" encapsulates the idea about the stories we choose to try and write for ourselves and the potential deadly consequences of doing so. I was so happy to see French back on her A game as I felt ""The Secret Place"" suffered a bit from having an alternating chapter side story that didn't quite grab my attention. Conway is a fascinating character, and I enjoyed learning more about her. Moran serves as the perfect partner for her, as the two are so opposite yet are able to come together as a whole in solving crimes, making them the ""odd power couple"" in a non romantic way. I was equally as glad to see minor characters from previous books make appearances. O'Kelly, the head honcho of the Murder squad, returns bringing his old school no-sense classical detective persona to the mix, which I always love. And Cooper, the pathologist with a dedication to work perfection who everybody has to walk on eggshells for while finding extremely difficult to work with is back as well. I adore Cooper and hope French adds him to the next story in ever greater detail. Tana French is my new favorite writer, and I feel with her attention to detail and superior characterisation of even the littlest of characters to the story sets her apart in the detective genre. By the time I finished the last few pages I had a grand smile on my face and goosebumps on my arms, a duo telling me I had such a fun time with each page. Now comes the two year wait for her next book!"
"Tana French has written five previous novels including In the Woods, The Likeness, Faithful Place, Broken Harbor, and the Secret Place. I have read them all and loved them. Her latest tells the story of Antoinette Conway, a detective for the Murder Squad in Dublin. She is feeling that the rest of the officers don't like her. he one exception is her partner Stephen Moran. he rest of her working life is a stream of vicious pranks, harassment, and thankless cases. heir latest case seems to be a lovers' quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is pretty, blonde. well-groomed and dead in her living room ext to a table set for a romantic dinner. Antoinette has seen her somewhere before, but can't remember where. Rory was Aislinn's boyfriend and he is brought in and questioned. he other detectives want his arrested, but Antoinette and Steve resist. Aislinn's best friend is hinting that she knew her friend was in danger and everything they find out about the murder victim takes her further from the passive person she seemed to be.
Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can't tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad. or is someone among the officers guilty of murder? French has some of the best back and forth interrogation scenes that i have read. At one point, French describes Conway as a complex companion, both bruising;y misanthropic: ''If he's not our guy, he's such a godawful damp weenie, the kind who needs regular slaps across the back of the head just to keep him from vanishing up his own hole''.
The novel is not an easy read and 450 pages of mostly dialog. But, it is a great read that I highly recommend."
"I found this story utterly captivating - thank goodness because at over 400 pages it would have been a daunting read otherwise. I loved how the author illustrates shifting perceptions and opinions so effortlessly as a murder team investigates the death of an attractive young woman. It matters that she's attractive.
One of the investigators remarks on how her appearance and home look like they've been bought from a catalogue. I kind of skipped over this thinking it was just a way of conveying a lack of imagination. Aaaah, that's probably why I'm not a detective, then.
I have read an earlier book in the Dublin Murder Squad series but didn't think I missed anything by having the gap (there had to be a gap because the book club chose this one as our next read). I remember the earlier one as a good read but this, the sixth book demonstrates an author at the top of her game.
There were passages about the stories we tell ourselves and each other that I thought were breathtaking. On page 387 I read:
""...I sit there running the heat to try and thaw my feet after Lucy's flat, and watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming , and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.""
And that's why, even though I found the central character to be aggressively troublesome, I couldn't put the book down."
"I can't say enough good things about Tana French...this is my third book to read of hers (first time with an audiobook) and each one has been fantastic. Not your typical mysteries, there is something deeper and meatier. Something you won't forget and won't want to end. Something....Human.

I read the first 2 in the Dublin Murder Squad series spaced over a period of time and skipped to this one (#6) when I saw I could get it on audio through Overdrive from my library. I have a couple of the others in the series on my shelf, but love her so much I was ""reserving"" them to read when I could really enjoy. I had not yet read the book that introduces us to Antoinette Conway, the main character in this one. (There were a few familiar faces here though for me.) so I started this with no previous ideas about her. Conway is a tough cookie, and has had to be so from a young age. She deals with drama everyday from her male coworkers, and she doesn't take crap off them. Luckily her partner is supportive, if not a bit of a pushover at times. They get assigned a ""straightforward"" case that is anything but. There are of course twists and turns here with a splash of personal drama intertwined. No spoilers, just my recommendation as a must-read!

Side note--I think I prefer the reading experience of her books over audio. Loved listening to this one, and the reader was great with an incredible Irish accent, but really love savoring a ""hard"" copy."
"Tana French’s new novel returns her to the storytelling of the first books in the Dublin Murder Squad series. From the title echoing that of the only other book focused on a woman detective, to the dynamic of the first novel, centered around a partnership, this is French at her very best.

Antoinette Conway worked hard to earn a spot on the murder squad, but just two years in, she’s seriously considering leaving for a job with a private security firm. Her co-workers are openly hostile and she’s stuck on the night shift with the newest detective, fielding domestics and bar brawls. It’s not what she signed up for. Then, she and Moran are given what at first looks like another routine domestic murder, except they’ve been called in just as their shift ended and their gaffer has assigned a senior detective to assist them. From there, it only gets messier and before long, Conway has to question everything from the too-convenient suspect of the boyfriend to the actions of her fellow detectives.

This one never loses momentum or lets the reader come up for air. French does her best writing with the rote tasks of police work, and with the complex relationship that exists between two detectives working well together. French is writing something quite a bit more substantial than a simple police procedural and I was with her every step of the way.

And now I’m left to wait for the next in the series."
"Antoinette Conway has had a hard time since she joined the Murder Squad. She strongly believes the rest of the squad hates her and is trying to push her out. The only person she trusts is her partner, Stephen Moran - he's also a newbie on the squad, and he has not buddied up with the other detectives against her. When the pull a seemingly standard domestic murder case at the end of a night shift, and their boss sends a third detective along with them, seemingly to babysit them. He is pushing them for an open-and-shut arrest - the boyfriend did it - but Conway and Moran can't shake the feeling that something else is going on. With their squad putting on the pressure for them to make the obvious arrest, and their rabbit hole getting wilder and weirder, and Conway getting so far into her head that she isn't even sure she trusts herself anymore, the tension is obviously palpable.

The is now my second-favorite book in the series (In the Woods has my heart, I suspect forever). Conway is not an especially likable character, but she's interesting. I love how the story is all up in the psychology of the Murder Squad - not just the main character telling the story, but the squad as a whole. It kept me guessing the whole time, even after I found out who the killer was (because the resolution was a little up in the air for a while). Loved it!"
"Antoinette Conway, of the Dublin Murder Squad, has returned. She and her partner, Stephen Moran, were given yet another domestic – the murder of Aislinn Murray – and Conway hates domestics. How she wishes that they would be given a nice, juicy high-profile murder. Be careful what you wish for, Antoinette!

We follow Conway and Moran as they try to sort out what happened to Murray and who killed her. We are drawn into the sometimes seedy world of the murder detective. Not only do Conway and Moran have to outthink and outwit the bad guys, but Dublin Murder Squad’s only female detective must do this dance with her own colleagues. Has hazing turned to harassment? Is anyone other than Moran in her corner? Wait…is Moran even in her corner?

We are caught up in these squad squabbles with Conway and can feel her reaching her breaking point. These simmer – then boil – beneath the murder investigation.

Although we suspect from the beginning that the “domestic” answer to Murray’s murder is not the correct answer, it is nonetheless masterful to watch how Conway and Moran work their way to the correct answer.

The Trespasser, like French’s previous novels, is a work woven from the exquisite, extraordinary character development for which she is known. It is, quite simply, another Tana French masterpiece!
"
"I have been WAITING for this book. I was hoping that Tana French would, at some point in this series, address 
bent cops and police brutality. She didn't disappoint. I'll admit, I struggled to get started with this one, much more than any of the others. Conway is a difficult character for me, and I honestly wasn't all that anxious to hear more about this murder when it was initially laid out. But of course, there's always that hook. It's so deftly done that I can never quite pinpoint when it happened or what it even was, and this adds all the more to its brilliance.

I flip-flopped for the entirety of the book on my opinion of Conway and her actions, her attitudes, and her beliefs. I'm sure this was French's intention. As the (presumably) sole woman on the squad, she receives abuse from the rest of her colleagues, and as someone who was already thick-skinned and blunt, she puts up all her defenses. Conway is, let's face it, mean. She's brash and at times arrogant, harsh and often unnecessarily cruel. But is it without reason? The reader is meant to question this, I think, and a less savvy reader might simply peg Conway as the defensive feminist and move on. But hopefully, French's treatment of the character and her reasoning comes through. All in all, this one wound up being just as amazing as all the others and I hope we're getting a new one soon."
"Irish author French has written a brilliant murder mystery with language that moves from street smart to lyrical. This is the kind of police procedural I love and am delighted to have found this Edgar-Award winning author at last. Hilda Fay, the narrator for the audiobook version, does an excellent job of transporting the reader to the streets of Dublin with her heavy Irish brogue.
The plot centers on Murder Squad partners Detective Antoinette Conway and Detective Stephen Moran’s efforts to solve a murder that at first glance looks like a domestic altercation turned violent. They are newbies on the Squad and have been delegated the boring task of handling ‘domestics’. The death of Aislinn Murray certainly fits the profile—but evidence soon points to murder. There are plenty of twists and turns as the facts of the case lead in different directions.
The first person narration is from the point-of-view of Antoinette and she is one, tough character. The Squad does not want her and they proceed to hassle her with disgusting pranks that cause her to become paranoid. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the exception and he is ‘charmer’ of the team. But both of them are relentless in following every lead. Highly recommend.
"
"All I want in life is to sit and read Tana French books. They're transporting and magical like no other fiction on the market today. This one kept me up till 1 AM on a work night two nights in a row -- I found the mystery twistier/more intriguing than that in ""Secret Place,"" and liked French's decision to 
reveal the killer 2/3s of the way through, so that the end of the book was consumed more with the emotional run-out of events ... probably my favorite part of French, anyway. The 
McCann/O'Kelly scene; godDAMN. The ""go out as a scumbag, or be a D one last time,"" is one of those lines that shouldn't work, but was so F'ING AWESOME in context I wanted to fist pump. I also really, really liked Antoinette's character, and the way her perceptions of the world were interrogated over the course of the action; the lesson she learned didn't feel facile or cheap, but relevant and smart. We might all think more about what role we play in the social dynamics that surround us.

HOW WILL I WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!?

For the record, my Tana hit list is now: In the Woods / Broken Harbor / The Likeness & Trespasser, tied for third favorite."
"With every novel, I am more in awe of Tana French. It's not just one thing, it's the whole package: It's that her books are smart and literary on a par with such writers as Donna Tartt; but their psychological intensity is alleviated by profane humor and wit, and the mystery itself is always intriguingly complex and wallow-able. It's that her characters are so spot-on and so fully realized that you would recognize them instantly if you ran into them in your corner café (and invite them for a cuppa or a pint, if you weren't too intimidated by them), and her scene-setting and description puts you right in the moment, in the room, in the town, in the weather and on the cobblestones of the damp streets of Dublin. Every time I read one, I can't put it down, but I also purposely delay finishing by an afternoon or a day by distracting myself with other things, because I know when I'm done I'll have a while to wait before I have another pleasure this good. Thank you, Tana French, for not taking 10 years to write a book like Donna Tartt does!"
"I really enjoy the way Tana French writes. Had anyone handed me the book without the author's name on it, I would have guessed it was her after the first few chapters. During this murder mystery, there were chapters I was reading and said aloud ""Yep, this is the Tana French we all know and love"". She keeps the suspense going right up until the very end and I had almost panicked because it looked like the perp was not going to confess and at least 3 suspects were tagged. I DID NOT want to be left hanging and I wasn't. There were a couple of other novels Tana has written that made me feel like I had to guess or provide my own theories and didn't have the answer as to right or wrong about the murder. Leaving me feeling hanged, lost, and frustrated sometimes. This novel did not disappoint. Brilliant plot, creatively written, and just the right kind of mystery all around. Bravo Tana French! Can't wait for the next book. "
"Tana French somehow gets better and better. Antoinette Conway is one tough murder detective. I found the look inside the Dublin Murder Squad to be extremely authentic and French places you firmly in the setting. Her dialogue and language makes you feel like you are right in the thick of the story. Murder Squad in the Dublin Castle -- I want to visit!

I speed read this one because I had to know how it was going to turn out and my hunch was completely wrong. This might be one that I go back and re-read because I'm sure I would pick up on more clues that French cleverly puts in and the reader is none the wiser. I was completely drawn into the murder investigation and it did not drag at all for me.

I was appalled at how much abuse a female detective takes within her own squad. I'm sure this is very realistic, just horrifying.

Keep these amazing books coming Tana French! I can't wait to see what you've got cooked up for us next."
"I had stopped with Tana French for gore, but this had so much buzz I gave it a try and was happy to find an engrossing page-turner that did not make me catch my breath but rather pulled me along, even though I guessed where it was going (but a got a few tables-turned surprises I hadn't seen coming). Police corruption gets its comeuppance; we all expect this early on. The surprise is the fine writing and the style of re-telling the story over and over without being repetitious, not leaping from mountaintop of terror to mountaintop of fear, but keeping the reader turning pages. Yes, Conway and Moran are up against it, Antoinette more than anyone as the sole (new) female cop on the Murder Squad, mercilessly hassled as we know women, high profile or low, to be. The Irish slang lowers the impact of her filthy mouth, but she is a cop among guys and this must be part of toughness. The plot is a thoughtful one, resting on moral choices and the nature of leadership. Loved it."
"There are several different storylines to The Trespasser, and it took about the first fifty pages to set up all the premises. Once Ms. French got going, the story took off. She was able to create the most intricate characters as well as the office politics of a police squad, all of it very convincing. I enjoyed the lead detective, tough Antoinette, and her partner, Steve, with the very realistic ups and downs of their partnership. I’m not so sure I enjoyed Antoinette’s everyone-is-out-to-get-me attitude, but even that was cleared up at the end. I enjoyed the development of the victim, Aislinn, who was naïve, yet determined with her Plan. There were many unexpected twists as the story was told, all complex but believable. I can usually figure out the ‘bad guy’ early but didn’t see the ending coming on this one until near the finish. This is Ms. French’s sixth novel. I’ve read them all and can easily say that she gets better with each one. I thoroughly enjoyed The Trespasser."
"Some books are like a quiet cup of tea, soothing and calm. Some books are like a cup of coffee with a friend, some good things to think about and an interesting story. Some books are like champagne, fizzy and exhilarating. Tana French writes books that are like extremely well-crafted bar drinks you find at an almost-trendy neighborhood bar with comfortable chairs and St. Germaine featured in its cocktails. . Each one is unique and they are all cravable, delicious, and leave you feeling goooooood.

The Trespasser is well written, finely-crafted storytelling, and character development with a punch. It instantly rocketed to my second favorite French novel (nothing tops The Likeness, which I went back and read immediately after finishing this). Antoinette is beautifully flawed and her partner is not a stereotype. The story has some lovely twists, but overall it is the writing that carries this book. Having read the library's copy, I will now go buy my own so I can reread this at will."
"Tana French is just one of the best wordsmiths working today, and I think this book is more than enough to keep her at that level. I can imagine some fans maybe being a little concerned at the sixth book in this series becoming a little formulaic, but to me the biggest thing was just getting to see a master at work. If you come to Tana French to worry strictly about the plot, it's like going to the Louvre and complaining that the croissants in the cafe aren't the best.

It also helped that I really, really wanted to see the inside of Antoinette Conway's head. She really is a prickly and difficult person, but I love her, and I am just a little bit sad we probably won't get another book narrated by her. On the other hand, I think I know who the next narrator IS likely to be, and I am super looking forward to THAT."
"I thought this was excellent. Very well written with great characters especially Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran. She has worked in the murder squad for two years but the rest of the team dislike her and want her gone. She is subject to a continuing campaign of harassment and sabotage which causes her to become increasingly paranoid. In fact this is one of the best descriptions of mounting paranoia that I can recall and very well described.

The story is relatively simple. A girl is murdered and the boyfriend is the suspect. Some of the interview scenes are, although very lengthy, brilliantly done with the tension rising to an almost unbearable level at times.

I have liked all of Tana French's books but this may be the best and certainly the best written. All good including a brilliant ending!"
"This is a helluva book in a helluva series. I have read all of them. This one, to me, was by far the best. This author has to be the best at introducing and fleshing out characters as I have ever seen. I feel as though I know Antoinette Conway so well, who is the narrator/detective in this book. She is tough, hardened, intuitive, and damaged. I also feel as though I know the murder victim, who is dead as the book begins, but the author is a master at peeling layer after layer after layer. I do not know how Tana French does it-a true storyteller.

If you are looking for action-packed gore, chases, plots, etc, this is not your author, but for a superb series involving the Murder Squad detectives in Dublin that is intelligent, well written, entertaining and seemingly realistic—you have found it in Tana French!"
"4+. french is on my short list of authors who can do no wrong. at first was disappointed not to get this from moran's POV but her character development is just so, so good. i love many a murder mystery, but it's a testament to the writer when the case is pretty cut and dry but was still engrossed. i'm sure i've said it before but my favorite format for a detective novel is when the reader is on the case with them, with no special knowledge. french is a master at taking us along the investigation and it feeling real -- logical procedure, realistic timelines (no CSI lab doing crazy experiments in 30 minutes), bureaucracy, no unexplained aha moments that don't make sense. i realize that sounds boring but it makes me more invested.

wasn't as magic as secret place, but still excellent."
"Antoinette Conway has always dreamed of being part of the Murder Squad: the glamor, the comradery, the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of the solve. Instead, she finds herself the butt of cruel pranks and jokes, ostracized from the all male squad, chasing domestic cases. It changes when Aislynn Murray turns up dead on her living room hearth. Conway is pushed toward the slam dunk solve of arresting the boyfriend, but that doesn't ring true to her. It's too neat; there are too many loose ends. Tana French continues with another tightly written mystery. Her characters are so beautifully drawn and her plots are somehow straight forward and twisting at the same time. I found myself not wanting to put the book down and not wanting it to end at the same time. "
"My second Tana French novel and I just love her style and characterisation and attention to detail. While my initial theory about whodunnit proved right in the end I still loved following stroppy Detective Conway and her very sympathetic partner Moran through to the end. Especially the interviews with witnesses and suspects gripped me. This type of procedural crime novel might be too slow moving and drawn out for some but I thoroughly enjoyed it, last but not least for the palpable contemporary Dublin atmosphere. Fully recommend!"
"I love Tana French and have been really enjoying her work for the past few months. I find her to be an excellent crime writer, with just the right amount of detail into the investigation process and procedure and the crime itself.
I thought that nothing would top Broken Harbor for me but this one has proven me wrong. I need more!"
"This was Tana French's most complicated mystery in the series. I'm so glad that I read them in order because it made this book all the richer. All of the books build on each other, layer by layer, flavor by flavor, until you're left with the whole world of the Dublin Murder Squad. I don't want that world or this series to end. I highly recommend to everyone to start with In the Woods and read all of them in order right through to this latest (I hope latest, not last) mystery."
"Tana French writes excellent mysteries. Her characters are dense and layered. This one features the same two folks who were in the preceding volume, which is unusual. there are moments when Antoinette Conway really annoyed me, but I think it is meant to be that way. Anyway, this is an excellent read. At some point it would surely be worth reading the whole series closer together to see how the different figures weave in and out. "
"I love this pair. One of the most appealing duos since the first book. I think it was really effective to have heard Steve’s experience first (in the previous book) before seeing it from Conroy’s side. It was an interesting exploration of bullying and paranoia and personal paradigm.

I think the detectives relationship played really well with the mystery story. Great red herrings. Not an exciting surprise reveal but one with heaps of meat and crunch."
"Another dark delight that I had to tear myself away from to sleep, eat, etc and yet I still finished it within about 40 hours. Every now and then I pause while reading a Dublin Murder Squad and wonder if the propulsive plot and stellar writing would hold up on a second read - and I bet it would, but I feel so at ease in French's storytelling that I just go along for the ride. The fathers in this story were a bit much for me but I still loved this book."
"Super excited to get this book. Love Tana French. She oozes smarts. Her dialogue is very un-tv-police procedural. The scenes are authentic and capture all the nitty gritty, all the ups and downs. I couldn't put the book down with about a third of the book left. There's lots of nuance, lots of insider twists. A definite must for crime fiction fans."
"I rarely read police procedural novels, though they are evidently quite popular. A friend recommended The Trespasser, though, and its prose, characterization, and pacing are all excellent. What more could one ask?"
"(4.5) A return to form for Tana French after The Secret Place, which was widely panned. Aside from that one, I'm one of her biggest fans and this might be my favorite of hers since The Likeness (it's a much better mystery too). Tightly plotted and suspenseful, with her typical quality lead characters. You see the ending coming but it's devastating all the same. "
"I guess I need more and more murdered in Dublin...

Love, love, love... Antoinette Conway. Long tall body, Like a wrecking ball... and Steve. Freckles distinguish the man. Kudos, to Tana French"
"Given that the preceding book in this series, The Secret Place, is about friendship (""Once you have mates who know you, right down under the this-and-that you decide people want to see today, then there's no room left for the someday person who'll magic you into being all your finest dreams""), it only stands to reason the peerless Tana French would next take a deeper -- and darker -- look at the role the people in our lives play in affecting the course of our lives:


No one needs a relationship. What you need is the basic cop-on to figure that out, in the face of all the media bulls**t screaming that you're nothing on your own and you're a dangerous freak if you disagree. The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all. And that doesn't just go for romance. I love my ma, I love my friends, I love the bones of them. If any of them wanted me to donate a kidney or crack a few heads, I'd do it, no questions asked. And if they all waved good-bye and walked out of my life tomorrow, I'd still be the same person I am today.

- Tana French, The Trespasser, (New York: Viking, 2016), 141


Right... but would you, though? That's French's existential preoccupation in The Trespasser, after previously exploring the themes of memory (In the Woods), identity (The Likeness), family (Faithful Place), order (Broken Harbor), and friendship (The Secret Place). It's a story about how the people who come into our orbit, whether by deliberate invitation or circumstantial happenstance, shape our very life experience: They create our reality -- sometimes deliberately, sometimes inadvertently; sometimes malignantly, sometimes benignly; sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, often a good bit of both -- regardless of the fanciful visions (the ""finest dreams,"" to quote French) we harbor about who we are and how things will be. I'm reminded of Sean Penn's elegiac soliloquy on the very subject in the (mostly forgotten) Irish mob movie State of Grace (1990):


But it was only an idea. Had nothin' to do with the truth, it's just... a f**kin' idea, like... you believe in angels, or the saints, or that there's such a thing as a state of grace. And you believe it. But it's got nothin' to do with reality. It's just an idea. I mean, you got your ideas and you got reality. They're all... they're all f**ked up.

- Screenplay by Dennis McIntyre (with uncredited contributions from David Rabe)


After experimenting in The Secret Place with the linear structure and exclusively first-person presentational style characteristic of the earlier Dublin Murder Squad books, French recommits in this installment to the series' more conventional mode of narrativity as POV protagonist Antoinette Conway (introduced in Secret Place) and partner Stephen Moran (narrator of Secret Place) investigate the break-in murder of a young woman Conway appraises as ""Dream Date Barbie""... and the more they uncover about the case, the less certain Conway is as to whom she can trust -- 
even (and especially) the very detectives on her squad (Moran included).

As we've come to expect (perhaps even take for granted by now), French's sense of pacing, ear for dialogue, eye for behavioral and atmospheric detail, and preternatural gift for characterization are firing on all cylinders here -- to say nothing of her skill at employing every turn of phrase and turn of plot in service to her theme. I am in no way a religious man, but in trying to ""shake this book off"" in the days following its completion -- because French's crime fiction always sticks to you somewhat uncomfortably (a high compliment, to be sure) -- I couldn't help but recall (and appreciate anew) the Lord's Prayer from my own Irish Catholic upbringing:

And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

Amen. And cheers to you, Ms. French; your characters and the world they inhabit are always a welcome addition to my own life experience."
"Officially I've read all TF books and I *need* more! How does she come up with such humor, memorable characters and incredible stories? I started thinking about making a trip to Dublin to meet her, shit you not."
"Plus two more stars! Complex, moody, and wonderfully written. I read it in a single day. WRITE FASTER, MS. FRENCH!"
I generally like something about every Tana French book - but I think I particularly like when she chooses a woman detective as her protagonist. 
"Stephen King recommended author. He says: ""I am increasingly in awe of French's narrative talents."""
"This might be my favorite Tana French book. Good main character, interesting mystery, and no supernatural components, which detracts a bit for me from some of the other books."
"I couldn't stop listening to this one (on audio). The twists and turns, and the intensity of the interviews, are amazing."
I've enjoyed every book by this writer.
I read this in exactly 24 hours. Unputdownable. I love Tana French.
I am a fan of this author. I may watch the the series on SBS. 
"Another re-read because I can't get enough of Tana French. I love the Dublin series and the recurring theme of partnership. A very compelling novel, with a terrific narrator in Conway."
"A young woman has been found dead in her flat after an anonymous call into a Dublin precinct in the wee hours before dawn. Detectives Antionette Conway and her partner Steve Moran are nearing the end of their night shift when they’re assigned the case. This book is narrated by Detective Conway.

When Conway and Moran arrive at the flat, they find the victim, Aislinn Murray, lying on the floor in a pool of blood from a head injury. Clearly, she was expecting company. She was wearing a pretty dress and heels, her makeup and hair had been done, and the table was set for a romantic dinner. This appears to be an open and shut case of a lovers’ quarrel gone wrong.

Not wasting any time, Conway and Moran interview the victim’s best friend. She tells them she knew Aislinn had a date the evening before with Rory Fallon, a guy she’d recently started seeing. But when Rory is interviewed, he says when he arrived at her flat, she didn’t answer her door or her phone, so he went back home, assuming she'd stood him up. He appears devastated when he learns Aislinn is dead, but the circumstantial evidence seems to be piling up against him.

Pressure is put on Conway and Moran to wrap the case up and arrest Rory. But a couple things are bothering them. When the detectives interviewed Aislinn’s best friend, she said that Aislinn had, until recently, been discreetly dating a married man, but after she met Rory, she was trying to break it off. The friend claimed she didn’t know who this gentleman was, but she seemed nervous talking about him. The detectives think she's holding something back. Can Conway and Moran keep the case open long enough to be sure they’re arresting the right person? The reader has to get to the very end to find out. And it's a very satisfying ending.

I don’t read “police procedural” novels as a rule. Nor do I read serial books. As a rule. But I’ve been a fan of Tana French since I read ""In the Wood"", the first book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Tana French isn’t for everybody. Many will find her books way too slow and detailed. Those who are in a hurry to find out “who done it” will become impatient with all her red herrings, her lengthy dialogues, and the minutia describing the surroundings. But when I read a Tana French book, I feel like a fly on the wall. I’m seeing what they’re seeing and hearing what they’re hearing. The characters become real flesh and blood. And I really hate them to leave when the book ends.

For anyone who might enjoy a leisurely seven course meal, ""The Trespasser"" might be a good selection. For those preferring a quick trip to Dairy Queen for a Blizzard, it might not. Just sayin’."
"JANUARY 2024
The more I think about it, the more Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway's friendship is one of my favorite character relationships of all time. And this book is a perfect encapsulation of it. Their trust in each other—and how easily it is shaken—is beautifully done. I want to go back and savor 
their explosive fight and Antoinette's eventual decision to trust Steve wholeheartedly just days later over and over again. And the way it so perfectly parallels and builds on the relationship we see them develop earlier in the book. This is Tana French at her most genius. Just a sheer masterclass in character writing.

JULY 2018
God I love the Dublin Murder Squad. I have never connected to a book more in my life. In The Trespasser, Tana French gave me the female character I've looked for my whole life but never found: Antoinette Conway. When you're a brown girl who grew up with a single mother, it's really difficult to find yourself depicted as the protagonist in crime fiction. It's even harder to find a woman who is unapologetically herself, not super feminine, a little bit angry, and okay with it. Antoinette Conway is all of these things. She is so comfortable in her own skin, she doesn't really care what other people think of her, and she isn't afraid to say what she wants to say. She's complex and she's real and she's so, so human. I didn't always agree with her, and I didn't always like her, but I love her.

Everyone in every Tana French novel is so complex. My favorite novels of hers, In The Woods, Broken Harbor, and this one, always suck the reader into the narrator's point of view. Of course Rob should lie to O'Kelly to work the Knocknaree case; of course every crime is black-and-white and you should follow the rules to the tee, just like Scorcher; of course everyone's out to get Conway. Of course you accept the way these narrators tell the story, even if it isn't the way you'd tell it, because it just makes so much sense, both emotionally and logically.

Because of that, there are honestly so many people I want to talk about in this novel. I really feel that The Secret Place didn't do justice to Steve Moran, who's Conway's partner in this novel. Steve and Conway are so great together. I honestly want a whole series about their adventures, because they fit so well together and they're perfect friends for each other. They don't get each other all the time, but they (usually) accept each other, and they've got each other pretty well figured out for partners that have only been working together six months.

And Aislinn. The murder victim. I don't know how she does it, but French always manages to make you see the victims as real human beings, which not every mystery writer can do. By the end of the novel, I usually end up knowing the murder victim just as well as I know the Murder Detective. I can't say anything without spoiling it, but Aislinn was NOT what I expected when I opened the novel. I think it's fair to say without giving too much away that Conway isn't a fan of Aislinn, but French uses Aislinn and Conway and the unexpected parallels between them to validate women of all sorts. And I loved the themes about women and womanhood in this novel. There aren't that many women in this book, and I think that's actually a good thing. I love diversity and representation, and usually I want more women in my books, but I sometimes think it's necessary to accurately reflect the real world in order to understand it in literature. The fact that Conway is the only woman on the squad, we don't really see her close female friends, and she spends a large majority of her time with men is not only reflective of the real world but necessary to her character and her story.

The one thing I wanted done better in this novel was the idea of Conway's race. We're told that Conway's mother is white but she's inherited her father's brown skin, which makes her stick out just about anywhere in Ireland, and especially on the Murder Squad. As a brown woman, I really thought French (who I believe is white) did a great job of not stereotyping brown women in her depiction of Conway's race. But I still think there could have been greater commentary on what Antoinette's life as a brown Irish woman is like. I did, however, love the fact that French wrote a book about a nonwhite character whose race isn't mentioned on every single page and whose entire arc isn't about the fact that she doesn't have white skin. Antoinette Conway is a human being before she's a person of color or a woman or a Murder Detective, which is something rare.

Spoilers for In The Woods and The Likeness ahead 
I know everyone's still looking for Cassie-Rob updates (well, at least I was), and I think Steve and Conway's friendship is helping me to let go. We do get a backhanded Cassie update here, though. Sam O'Neill, who she supposedly marries, is still on the Murder Squad, he's still a solid guy, albeit complicit in Conway's ""exile,"" and Cassie isn't there. Presumably, she's still in Domestic Violence, where we left her at the end of The Likeness, and I'm led to believe that they're still married because Conway mentions multiple times that most of the Murder Detectives are married, except for her and Steve. I'll always miss Rob and Cassie's relationship, but I think Steve and Conway take the cake for favorite Dublin Murder Squad friendship. Minor spoiler for Broken Harbor ahead 
It's also hinted that Conway is the replacement for Scorcher Kennedy from Broken Harbor, and I love that because they're complete opposites of each other and also two of my favorite characters in the whole series. French really draws on hints from the entire series to add more complexity to Conway, Moran, and the other characters in The Trespasser. The fact that Sophie Miller is Conway's favorite Bureau Tech links Antoinette to Rob; there are hints at where Cassie is; Frank Mackey is mentioned; there are references to Scorcher Kennedy; and of course, Moran is there all the way. The way French incorporates the rest of the Dublin Murder Squad series really rounds this book out and makes it even better.

I kind of want Tana French to keep writing more Dublin Murder Squad books, but I think this book is also the perfect conclusion to the series. You start off the series with In The Woods 
destroying your faith in an individual detective and you end with The Trespasser 
destroying your faith in the whole squad and seeing the end of O'Kelly, one of the few characters that ties the whole series together. The Trespasser and Antoinette Conway (and the appearance of Bureau Tech Sophie Miller, who hasn't really appeared since In The Woods!) really bring the series full-circle. I'd love to keep reading new Dublin Murder Squad books forever, but every series has to end somewhere, and to be honest, I think if DMS ends here, I wouldn't be upset.

I've rambled enough, so I'm going to end this review after saying this: everything about this book is so pitch-perfect. At this point, I'd read anything Tana French writes.

All the stars to The Trespasser."
"Antoinette Conway is possibly my favorite character of all time. Why? Her stream of consciousness observations:

“I’m amazed this guy manages to get out of bed in the morning without working himself into a panic attack over the chance that he might trip on the bath mat and stab himself in the eye socket with his toothbrush and be left with a permanent twitch that will ruin his chances of landing an airplane safely if the pilot has a heart attack and doom hundreds to a fiery death.”

This woman was born for the Dublin Murder Squad, a group of misogynistic asshats that demand loyalty to their mates above actually investigating crimes and seeking justice for the victims. Conway has been relegated to the night shift where she and her partner are assigned a never-ending rehash of domestic violence cases and drunken brawls.

“Me and my partner are finishing up another night shift, the kind I used to think wouldn’t exist on the Murder Squad: a massive scoop of boring and a bigger one of stupid, topped off with an avalanche of paperwork.”

Conway is an excellent detective held down by lousy assignments and “teammates” dedicated to keeping her from doing her job. She and her partner, Stephen Moran, are handed the case of Aislinn Murray, apparently a victim of manslaughter. If this is a simple case of a woman being knocked down in an argument with her boyfriend and hitting her head on the hearth, why do they need the supervision of department superstar Detective Breslin? And why is Breslin pushing so hard for them to reach a single conclusion, and quickly, without investigating other scenarios?

Conway and Moran are a tight team in spite of Breslin’s efforts to undermine their trust in each other. Questions about the guilt of the prime suspect multiply and red herrings are strewn in the detectives’ path by their erstwhile mentor. The author creates a complex and often contradictory web of evidence that keeps the tension level high from start to finish. The novel is exhausting and irresistible; I couldn’t put it down.

This is the type of story that French excels at. I highly recommend this book and the rest of the Dublin Murder Squad series to anyone who wants an intelligent and gripping murder mystery."
"Musím se přiznat, že jednak mám moc rád tuto sérii (Dublin Murder Squad - Vetřelec je zatím poslední díl této série) a druhak jsem nějakým nedopatřením přeskočil pátý díl. Každopádně pokud jste četli pátý díl, tak v tomto se opět setkáte s dvojicí detektivů Antoinette Conway (drsná slečna s arabskými kořeny) a Stephen Moran (kterého Antoinette do dublinské mordparty přivedla).  --- Těsně před koncem své noční směny dostane naše dvojice za úkol vyšetřit další z případů domácího násilí. Nedaleko svého bydliště najde Antoinette zavražděnou mladou ženu a zprvu to vypadá, že tento případ bude velmi jednoduchý. Ale to by nebyla pořádná detektivka ale nudná povídka, že? --- Hned při převzetí případu šéf přidělí našim detektivům jako dozor neoblíbeného zkušenějšího kolegu. Antoinette vede trošku boj s většinou svých kolegů a tak je i trošku paranoidní a to je vzhledem k tomu, že se lehce naštve, panují mezi ní a zbytkem kolektivu hodně napjaté vztahy. Aby to nebylo tak jednoduché, uvědomí si Antoinette, že se v minulosti se zavražděnou ženou někde setkala. Kdysi dávno, kdy ještě ani nepracovala na oddělení vražd. Vzpomene si odkud ji zná a dotáhne případ do zdárného konce? --- Vetřelec je také taková detektivka oldskoolovějšího střihu jako je série s Cormoranem Strikem. Zatímco Smrtící bílá mne hodně zklamala, tak Vetřelec se mi líbil hodně. Obrovský prostor v knize je věnován samotným výslechům svědků a obviněných. Každý výslech je dopodrobna rozepsán na mnoha stranách ale minimálně mne to vůbec nevadilo. Naopak jsem si tu dynamickou psychologickou hru na kočku a myš, kterou hráli policisté s vyslýchanými náramně užíval. Tana prostě pravítkuje. --- Občas mne hlavní hrdinka lezla na nervy ale většinu času jsem ji držel palce. Čtenář si užije i dosti dějových zvratů a kupodivu je nejsou odhadnutelné už od třetí kapitoly. Tempo vyprávění je místy celkem ostré, jindy je volnější ale zbytečné vaty zde moc nenajdete. Autorka dokázala, že skvělá detektivka se obejde i bez spousty brutality, téměř nerealistických akčních scén a spektakulárních sériových vrahů zanechávajících složité biblické vzkazy. Téměř došlo k přenesení klasické paní Agaty do 21. století. Jo a pokud to ještě nevyplynulo z kontextu: velké doporučení."
"The main protagonist in 'The Trespasser' Antoinette Conway is the only woman detective on the Murder Squad. She is tough as nails, takes no mess and has a chip on her shoulder the size of the Rock of Gibraltar. Her persecution complex, Daddy and Mommy issues and tendency to repress anything that smells like emotion actually make her a great detective, but it's also her Achilles heel. And this case, a case where a pretty young woman is found dead in her apartment, triggers all of Conway's weaknesses, even while it calls for her to draw on her greatest strengths to solve it. I was exasperated with her for much of the book, but enjoyed how her sharp edges and volatile temper were a foil for her much more laidback partner, Steve. I loved seeing the dynamics of the squad play out, with the various personalities and rivalries, the conflict and the competition, almost as much as I was engrossed in the mystery. And I have to say, this writer is so skilled, I found myself second-guessing every step of the way, even up to the last 20 pages, who might have done what and why.

This is only the second book of hers I've read, and I think I can already say that I'm now a dedicated Tana French fan. Painstaking development of characters, intricate and tight plots without a single loose end, or false note. This is mystery-suspense and police procedural done right, or at least, to my taste. What I think I admire most though, is that the writing is so, so good, never rushed, full of atmospheric details and mood. If you like mysteries and police procedurals, but are also a fan of literary fiction, her books will give you a taste of both. On the other hand, if you'd just like to get to the shock-and-awe stuff, and could do without the slow, layered unfolding of backstory as well as the primary narrative, this author might have you pulling your hair out. This is not rushed, cheap-thrill fiction. This is a master storyteller, who also happens to be a damned good writer as well."
"Tana French has finally done it — written a Dublin Murder Squad mystery that didn't make me want to throw the book across the room when I was done. (This is particularly appreciated because this was the first one I read as an audiobook, and that couldn't possibly have been good for my phone!) As with the previous books in the series, I did not want to put this one down. Her writing is just so good. I knew I was not going to be able to figure out the killer, and I was happy to go along for the ride. The characters feel real, so even when they're doing things that are a bit out there, it's believable. The audiobook narrator was excellent, and I enjoyed experiencing this one in the array of Irish accents that the characters have. French is committed to writing characters who sound Irish, even when their idioms might be incomprehensible to Americans, and so you get more of the intonation and meaning when they're read aloud.

Each of the Dublin Murder Squad books focuses on a different detective, and while they do reference events from earlier books, it's not necessary to read them in order. If you don't mind having an ending that's unresolved or where justice isn't fully served or the main character isn't someone you can root for, then by all means, start with the first book, In the Woods. But if you like your mysteries wrapped up at the end, with a narrator who isn't a horrible person, then your best bet is to read this one."
"Well, I accidentally read this book first. We're in the process in our library, of putting volume numbers on series. This one didn't have that yet. We got this book in and immediately it called to me. I got on overdrive, downloaded the audio version and proceeded to shut everything out while I listened to this wonderful tale.

It takes place in Ireland, which already is a great starting point. It's about a murder squad case, which is a second point scored. The main character, to hear her speak, was amazing. I'm really glad I listened to this one and didn't just read it.

Antoinette or ""Conway"" as she's known in the squad is a bright, damaged girl who is out to fit in with the squad, as the only female. She wants to shine, and solving cases is what she does best.

This one keeps you guessing until the end, and even then, the very end is another twisty turn. The politics she faces as a woman on a squad full of men is all too real, and reflects the current climate that women in this position face. It keeps the case open and living perhaps longer than it should have taken, but it speaks to reality, which also makes for a good story.

To call this book a thriller is to not give it it's due. It's so much more than that, and French is really able to bring her characters to life and give them great depth.

Will definitely be reading the first five books of this series."
"Wow! Wow! Wow!

Whatever I read next will feel lacking.

This series is superb and yet each book is a stand-alone jewel. Antoinette Conway is finding her time on the much-dreamed of Murder Squad pure ""shite."" Being the sole woman detective is not the only reason for the harassment from the other D's. Even members of the press seem out to get her.The situation has made her paranoid.

And then there are the cases her and her partner Steve are thrown. Domestic murders. No glory in those quick solves.

The latest murder is just another of the same. An obvious domestic. Or is it ....?

The investigation, which seems ordinary at first, slowly reveals more and more anomalies. Have Conway and Moran finally caught a break, or are Steve's fantasies just that.

Their investigation had me turning pages and mulling new information as if I, too, was part of the team. She is a great character even if she trusts no one.

The build to the climax was masterful and the twists and turns never seemed to end.

I'm considering going back and re-reading the whole series for pure enjoyment until the next one comes out."
"I just recently read the 5th book, The Secret Place, and when I finished it, I was hoping that Tana French had chosen to write this one from Antoinette Conway's POV - score! Conway has been one of the most interesting narrators so far, and it was nice to spend more time with her and Detective Stephen Moran, who narrated #5. It made this book almost like a continuation of the one before.

In The Trespasser, we learn quite a bit more about what has made Detective Conway so...prickly, and the main storyline follows Conway and Moran as they catch a case that turns out not to be the ""straightforward domestic"" they thought it would be. I was totally hooked as they worked this case, while trying to stay a step ahead of both a journalist and another detective who seem determined to sabotage the investigation.

I'd be happy to read an entire series with Conway as the main character, but unless French breaks form, the next book will focus on another character. Will it be someone mentioned in this book or someone she digs up from an earlier one?"
"An amazing police thriller with deep psychological insight.

Detective Antoinette Conway along with her partner, Stephen Moran, are the most recent members of Dublin's Murder Squad.
Conway is the only woman of the Squad. That, and being a newbie, has caused her to be a target for hazing and harassment. Other than Steve, she can't stand the rest of the detectives.
She's an in-your-face, take-no-crap cop. She is also a wonderfully complex and fascinating character.
She has more than a hint of paranoia, but with maybe good reason.

Being low on the totem pole also means the two partners draw low-profile cases.
So when the call comes early one Sunday morning for a murder that's seemingly a routine domestic. They're thinking, ""Here we go again"".

They discover a case that is the the polar opposite of ""routine""!

The plot is a maze. They will butt up against many dead ends, encounter deceit and deception, have to right themselves and try down the next path. They don't like where it's going, but they are tenacious.

Will they find the light at the end of this serpentine tunnel and get to the heart of the matter?

Strap in. Enjoy the ride. And find out."
"I think this is the fourth book I've read in this series and it is probably my favorite. This one is rather different than your standard murder mystery. First I appreciate that the case is not some super complex weird bizarre scenario but a more garden variety murder. Second, the details of the investigation are fascinating and very detailed. Other mysteries have the heroic detective doing everything even as a serial killer murders half of Scandinavia. In this book we get a taste of the drudgery and dead ends and very detailed work that goes into building a case. Which is perhaps why it is so long as many reviewers have noted. Third, the other aspect of this book is like a high stakes workplace drama: this is no unified detective team. In fact they often seem to be working against each other. This can be hard to take at times. It also illuminates a police culture where getting an arrest and conviction and closing the case is much more important than the truth. There are a few flaws in this book, I'd give it 4.5 stars but they didn't bother me too much. I read the audiobook and the reader was very good though her Breslin voice is so creepy that I couldn't help hating him more than perhaps the writing justified. "
"I nearly stopped reading this novel several times, and ended up being glad that I persisted, and finished it. The book took me well over a week to read - very unusual for me. It is a very long book too, but I solved the problem of the size by resorting to a Kindle edition.

Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are struggling to work out why they were assigned this case. Perhaps it was because they were early to work. What does their boss have in mind? Antoinette suspects that it is her last chance to prove herself. Neither she nor Stephen have been popular with other members of the Murder Squad, and others seem to take great delight in sabotaging her work. And why did the boss insist they take Detective Breslin on their team? He seems to barely tolerate them.

On the surface this seems as if it could be a lovers' tiff gone wrong, but then the suspect seems wrong, and he insists that he has never entered the dead woman's flat. Gradually a different slant on the scenario emerges.

The detail in this plot is incredible, as is the insight into how detectives work."
"4.5ish

Third time is the charm apparently— I picked this book twice before and put it down after one chapter both times mainly because I didn’t like the book before this one— couldn’t be arsed about either Conway or Moran, and Conway being the lead detective here wasn’t a huge selling point.

But I’m so glad I picked up even if my reason was to read something I wouldn’t be hooked to and ignore my deadlines etc but that’s exactly what happens haven’t done shit the past two days but I’ll stress about that tomorrow.

This was great, I actually warmed up to Conway like a lot she’s hardly my favorite but still. Tana French is one of the best mystery writers I’ve ever read. She’s one of a kind and all around brilliant. With this book I picked up what was going on pretty early on— which hardly ever happens with Tana French but I still loved this book— case in point I wrote a review which I hardly ever do now, especially one with multiple sentences"
"A woman in this story has her dad pop up after years with no contact whatsoever. I've known women to whom this has happened, and they've gushed over their dad's explanations and forgiven him all because they don't know what a good dad is: he is there to read to you at night when you're small, teach you to ride a bike, help you with homework, take you to the movies, worry over you on your first date. So when this not-a-real-man shows up, sadly, women I've known, they just want a dad and they forgive the bum that was the sperm donor but never around for her when she was growing up, and pretend it is all OK. But in this story, whether realistic or not, the character does not do that. She kicks the SOB to the curb. ONE reason I liked the book. Far better reason I liked it is that I read Tana French's first novel, Into The Woods, which had a GREAT mystery but one that goes unsolved - the reader never knows what happened - and I was livid and swore I would never read French again. Well, my Secret Santa gave me this book, which is French's sixth, and not only did I get a GREAT mystery, she solves it! That's not why it gets five stars, though: it gets five stars because of the writing. The character who is BAD, very, very BAD, the culprit behind it all, I felt sorry for, such was the it-is-never-only-black-and-white nature of the writing, which is 100% realistic. Flawless writing, TERRIFIC protagonist in Detective Antoinette Conway, the wonderful setting of Dublin. I am VERY glad to have read another of French's novels - HIGHLY recommend!"
"Tana French beautifully crafted a slow burn murder mystery that keeps you hooked until the very last page. The Trespasser obliterates the TV view of detective work with an artfully crafted story line that draws the reader into the understanding of the actuality behind trying to catch a killer.

Antoinette is a beautifully crafted main character who is not only struggling to fully understand who she is but also fights to break through the stigma of being a female detective. The story is told through her eyes allowing the reader to be swept up in the emotions and actions Antoinette feels on a daily basis as she tracks down the killer of Aislinn Murray.

This was my first book by Tana French. I was happily surprised by the thought and careful detail that goes into her writing as she crafts this murder mystery. No loose ends were left dangling or stone unturned. I will definitely be open to picking up another book by French in the future."
"Another exceptional Dublin Murder Squad installment. French makes the characters and their situations believable, very human and compelling. I kept finding excuses to listen to the story. The narration on this audiobook was excellent.

As always, French makes no excuses for her protagonist's personal foibles and incorporates them in the story. Detective Antoinette Conway has a chip on her shoulder the size of brick and this comes into play in the story. She's lucky to have a sympathetic partner, even though he too has a blind spot or two. Still, the two of them play off one another and the squad, as the investigation proceeds and falters along the way.

I love the psychological insights into characters as it adds so much complexity to the story, which ends in probably the only plausible way it can. Yes, we find out who ""did it"", but as with so much in life, nothing is completely straightforward. 'nuff said. Terrific book."
"Tana French's novels are a good reason why some stories can be fully realised only through books and not through TV series or movies. The subtle manner in which she (yet again) delved deep into the minds of her protagonist as well as victim and managed to come out with startling relatable truths was commendable. Detective Antoinette Conway was definitely a memorable character and her antics alongwith her partner Moran was consistently engaging. The writing style was of high quality (as usual) and the crime detection , while not a great whodunit still managed to give me the immoral temptation to peek into the last page for the identity of the killer. However, the temptation was resisted this time around unlike the case of Broken Harbour (also by Tana French) which was the only instance I succumbed to it in my reading stint. While this book can be read as a standalone novel, it is highly recommended to read it in chronological sequence due to recurring characters from previous novels."
"Another amazing work by Tana French! She is able to create a completely compelling mystery where the reader is also completely absorbed in the detective. While I have complicated feelings about Conway, I can easily say that I felt like I completely understood her and as I got a sense of how she thinks I was then also able to understand why she made the choices she did (like them or not). The narrator was excellent and her voices always matched the feelings and characters perfectly. The voices for Breslan, Conway and McCann where definitely the best. Can't wait for the next one, hoping it will be told from Steve's perspective."
"This may be my most favorite Dublin Murder Squad book yet! (I know, I've said that before) Rather than atmospheric and creepy, this one is psychological (and yet also a thrilling whodunit). It centers on Antoinette, who we were introduced to in the last book via Steven Moran. As a woman who has been shoving her way into a boys' club before (in music, for me), I could relate enough to Antoinette's hassles to be totally pulled into her paranoia. Her shifting perspective as the book progresses makes a lovely parallel to the shifting mystery driving the action. Overall, totally satisfying from start to finish."
"Tana French’s mysteries have always been remarkably grounded: crimes involving everyday people, with no conspiracies or threats against the mayor or races against time before an orphanage blows up. “The Trespasser” nudges up against that line a bit, but never loses focus on the real stars of French’s series: the detectives. Detective Antoinette Conway is a prickly member of the Dublin Murder Squad, and for good reason: she and her partner get assigned the worst cases, her personal effects constantly go missing, and unflattering rumors spread behind her back. And so when another veteran detective is assigned to oversee her in her latest case - a seemingly straightforward domestic violence murder - her hackles are raised. But are her suspicions justified, or is she suffering from paranoia?

The search for that answer twists through “The Trespasser”, and for the first time the detectives are forced to use their skills against fellow detectives - a heightening of stakes that was most enjoyable to read. Even better, the pace and escalations are steady, and the ultimate resolution is both surprising and extremely satisfying. “The Trespasser” is among the best in the series."
"I've read all of Tana French, some of the Dublin Murder Squad books twice, including this one. They're all amazing. I love this one a lot. It's deceptively simple, and on re-reading you figure out precisely how well planned and structured it really is, how the characters give rise to the story and the themes, and that it's all completely seamless. Conway and Moran are a wonderful pair, her bitterness and his optimism, and these traits are so deeply imagined and fully realized that they're not like clothing that the characters wear, they are inside the characters at their very essence. French writes some of the most fully realized characters I've read by any living author. "
"I love every single one of Tana French's books. These are not your typical detective-murder mystery novels. These books and this one is a wonderfully complex tale full of rich characters, a murder with so many twists and turns you can't see it coming, and complicated relationships. I loved this novel. The only downside is that the time between reading this novel and the previous was too long and I couldn't fully remember Antoinette Conway (bit player in previous novels) who is the main character in this one. "
"Beautiful! My absolute favorite of the Dublin series. It was worth all the teenage angst from the prior book. Adore Connelly's character, and I got so involved, that when they told the final suspect the reason behind the motive and then later when the final suspect made a comment about the reason, I wondered if that person truly understood. Had to remind myself it was novel. Loved that it made me think back to all the twists and turns leading up to the finale of it. Thanks Tana, keep writing like this."
"Yesss this the good shit!!

Is is just my bias towards women that makes me love Tana French's female-helmed novels so much better than the other ones? This is definitely one of her best. I'm not sure which I love most between this, The Likeness, and Faithful Place (which admittedly is not narrated by a women, and yet is excellent.)

I love everything about this one, from the dynamic between Steve and Antoinette, the murder itself, the victim's story, Antoinette's fraught position in the murder squad, even Breslin's dumbass self. I love the way none of this plays out the way I expected. I really want Steve and Antoinette to get together, I hope she writes another Murder Squad novel, though I don't know who would helm it. Maybe go back to Cassie?"
"This book had all the strengths of the best books in the Dublin Murder Squad series - strong and compelling central characters, in-depth exploration of guilt and corruption, and a twisty mystery that is much more interesting and complex the more you learn about it. This was a completely satisfying read, and the protagonist Antoinette Conway is smart, tough, and way more competent than most of her colleagues.

I'm just sad that this is the last in the Dublin Murder Squad series, and I haven't heard about French continuing it."
"When I grow up I want to be Tana French. Her level of detail and creativity in writing her books never fail to astound me. I love that she works her way through a different main character each book, and though I'm always missing the previous one, I end up falling in love with the new one!

Unique story to this book. So good. All hail Tana.

* I actually listened to the audiobook, and the narrator did a fantastic job! 10/10 would recommend."
"Fantastic read and perhaps her best! Infinitely better than her 5th book. Tana French has recovered the pace, her affinity with the language and now explores paranoia. Very interesting to read your heroine going through a work based nightmare and how she gets through it as well as doing her job. The ending is unsettling but sadly, very believable. Once again though, Tana French will have you hooked and desperate to know how it happened."
"I am giving this one 5 stars because I simply could not put it down. There was a bit in the beginning that was wearing on me, Antoinette was such a hard ass, I really wanted her to let up. A lot of thing tie together in this book for the characters, and I like how French pulled it off. I do have to say that I was able to guess (but not totally) the ending. I’m not a huge crime reader, in fact French is the only one I’m really loyal to. She doesn’t disappoint. "
"Somewhere along the line, the Dublin Murder Squad novels seem to have shifted slightly from ""novel"" to ""thriller"". I liked the creepy villages, deserted laneways, and black nights of the Irish countryside a little bit more than the bleak landscape of Detective Conway's inner workings. However, that's not to say this book wasn't successful - quite the opposite! The relationship between Detectives Conway and Moran fits perfectly, especially when compared to the team who started us off, Maddox and Ryan. The final scene here was both uplifting and heartrending in equal measure. Yes, at one point near the middle I began to feel a little bit like I was waiting for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to quit wandering and actually find a horcrux, but I certainly hope there is more Dublin Murder Squad in the future!"
"The last book in this 6 book series featuring the Dublin Murder Squad, and this one centered around the tough female squad member in the last book, Secret Places, Detective Antoinette Conway. I think this was the best of the series. It kept me turning the page the whole book. The plot kept twisting and becoming more intricate/interconnected. I think it was even better than The Likeness, which was amazing. The ending even had a very satisfying ending that I didn’t see coming at all. "
"Tana French produces consistently good page-turners, carefully plotted, immaculately detailed, and told smoothly, with frictionless prose; this particular novel is devious as fuck and filled with infuriating characters, including the main ones. It also digs into themes around race and gender that are approached from the POV of believable characters in a way that the best crime fiction can pull off better than any essay on the subject. Read it. "
"Into the Woods is still my favorite Tana French novel but this one is up there. Parts were slow but I could not put it down the last half. Her character development is spot on- times I hated Antoinette and would be frustrated with her, but when she has epiphanies (personal and professional), I was right there, rooting with her. Awesome. "
"This Murder Squad story is the best, I think, in terms of plot. I didn’t feel any nagging threads which sometimes drive me crazy in mysteries. Very satisfying ending. I like Conway and Moran together but was surprised that French featured them twice in a row. I imagine that won’t happen a third time. "
"Tana French knows how to keep you on your toes. Just when you think you have it figured out she throws in a sticky wrench. What a stressfully fantastic read. So real and gritty, lots of character, lots of ‘in your head’ moments that don’t always feel that way till your clear of it.
Great read, just what I needed."
"She never disappoints

Tanya French is masterful. From her character development that has you rooting for detective Conway one minute and wanting to strangle her the next, to a plot full of twists and turns that leaves you wondering how the story can possibly unravel to a satisfying end. But it does and all the answer comes IN THE LAST FIVE PAGES OF THE BOOK.

Brilliant"
"An angry young female detective narrates her story as she tries to solve the murder of a young woman and also maintain her position on the Dublin murder squad. Read the synopsis elsewhere. Antoinette is, at times, too angry and paranoid for her own good, but she's smart and generally has good instincts. It's fascinating to sit in her head and work out what's happening.

Both the audible narration (with strong Irish accent) and print versions were great."
"Another amazing work by Tana. She illustrates every scene and motive brilliantly. My only critique was that a few pieces of the puzzle felt a bit too narrative driven, ie there was a moment of clarity where suddenly a piece of truth comes to a character, rather than evidence or an interrogation being the conduit. "
"The narrator relates her struggle through the investigation of a murder, the victim a single woman whose personal story dissolves the closer she looks. At the same time, she is struggling through more ptsd than she seems able or willing to recognize from workplace harassment as a female detective on the Dublin Murder Squad. True to form, Tana French is riveting. "
"Hands down my favorite DMS book. Sorry, Frank, Antoinette is my new fave. The plot was tight and heart wrenching, A+S made the best partner duo ever, and that final chapter with O’Kelly nearly destroyed me emotionally. I wish this book had been twice as long so I could keep reading it forever, failing that I'm going to dive into my dwindling stack of Tana French books right away."
"Every time I pick up a Tana French novel I know it's going to be a wild ride. My sleep will be disturbed. The characters will haunt my thoughts. I will be so rattled I'll have to put the book down. Then it's magnetic pull will make me pick it back up, and I'll read on tenterhooks until the story starts to be a bit of more comfortable again (OK, this is what should be happening). Then there's the point where I'll be committed until I reach the end.

This is why I read."
"The series is over. How incredibly rude.

Honestly this one was a whirlwind- they totally had me on the gang theory for a while, absolutely convinced. How it turned out was awful but revealed a lot about the integrity of the squad and their values. I love that O’Kelly was casually in the background of all the books and able to have a big moment at the end of the series."
"Same detectives as in The Secret Place and also similar themes in a confusing investigation. However, this was executed much better. The characters and plot are well defined and interesting such that you start to feel the same weariness as the detectives as you all try to make sense of the chaotic case, the deception involved, and the red herrings."
Tana French has become one of my favorite authors in this genre over the last couple of years. There are so many different twists in her books that it's impossible to guess what's coming. I look forward to the next one.
Absolutely amazing! The plot was really unexpected and the ending was just magnificent. A book I could definitely see myself reading again in the future. Looking forward to read more from Tana French.
"I don't remember when I read this. I was late to joining Goodreads so I've only just started recording the books I've read. I do remember I enjoyed it enough to read another of Tara French's books, 'In the Woods' and have just purchased 'The Witch Elm'. "
"French is a wonderful writer. The characters in the Dublin Murder Squad were compelling, the dialogue immersive, and considerable wit and scheming involved in the book. The ending's a bit pat -- a bit deus ex machina -- but that's easy to forgive in a book I found gripping for 90% of the ride."
"The Trespasser does not disappoint. Gripping, fast paced police procedural and simultaneously a meditation on the intentional meanness people do to one another and, more importantly, the mean tricks we unintentionally do to ourselves. "
This was a slow read for me. Partly because I have been busy and partly due to the writing style. Tana writes with so much detail which makes you feel like you are really in the story. I will be reading more of her work. 
"Solid storyline, complex characters

Tanya French can write a full a d complex character like few others and the murder case keeps readers engaged and case-solving through to the very end. Well done."
"Tana French is one of my favorite crime writers!! And I have read plenty of British and Irish crime fiction so I’m pretty qualified to judge the average, the good, the great, and the BEST. Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad books are definitely in the BEST category. Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are tough detectives who have to face headwinds from other detectives in the squad (who happen to have a connection to the murder case). Highly recommend this series."
Absolutely fantastic audiobook. The final four hours were so gripping I was making excuses to go for walks just so I could listen to it.
This might be my favorite one. I hated Conway in The Secret Place. Barely tolerated her through the majority of this book. Yet at the end she is one of my favorite Tana French characters. Right after Cassie. Cannot wait to see what is next for the Dublin Murder Squad.
"Fucking incredible. The best in this series since In The Woods.

I love how French always has what's going on with the case have a parallel with what is going on with the detectives, this time it's spinning stories/fantasies. Ahhh I have so many thoughts but haven't organized them yet."
Awesome book! Kept me on edge from the very beginning to the very end. 
I loved this story....hard to keep going until about a third of the way in but then I was hooked.
"Jesus, Tana French is so gifted. This was gorgeously paced and impossible to put down."
I am just going to sit here quietly and hold my breath until I have book 7 of the Dublin Murder Squad in my hands.
"just incredible, what am i supposed to do now that im out of these"
"The Dublin Murder Squad is one heck of a series, and French is a fantastic writer. I’ll be waiting and watching for more of the Squad!"
"Excellent as always
Audio is also excellent"
This is my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series.
I absolutely LOVE Tana French. She has become one of my favorite authors and I voraciously read anything she writes. It's like you're watching a fast paced detective story in your head.
"I have never understood the hoopla about Tana French until I read this book. The energy was incredible, and the characters were all well-developed. I’m glad I read it!"
"So long but so good on audio! A+ reader, great character, pretty good story. Never wanted to stop listening. "
"Amazing, as usual. "
"Well, I stayed up into the early morning reading a Dublin Murder squad book again. Oops! No regrets, this one is tip top. "
Loved this one! It ended the way I suspected — and hoped — it would end. 
Tana French makes you feel like you are part of an honest-to-goodness murder investigation. From the get-go The Trespasser doesn't miss a detail and it's all the better for it.
Fantastic character-building. Expert writing from a first-person POV. An exciting mystery with great psychological depth.
Another great book - I love Tana French’s writing and the details in the characters. I was sorry it ended to be honest!
My favorite Tana French book and the last in this series of six. 
"Just a cut above most other crime fiction, the absolutely stunning interview scenes are the draw in this one.

"
This is definitely my year of reading Tana French. Have just read through all six Dublin books and have now moved on to Witch Elm. Really didn't want this one to end because I was so happy in Dublin. She's fabulous.
"Love Tana French

You can’t beat a good Tana French detective story. She always has lots of twists and turns and a great ending!"
this series can't be over i want another one tana please
"A tough female detective in Dublin battles workplace bullying, paranoia and solves crimes in this pacy but long thriller mystery. The first-person, present-tense narrative feels breathless, exciting and the author is at her best deploying Detective Antoinette Conway's stream of consciousness interior monologue and mental processes as she tries to figure out who she can trust and where the truth lies. "
"I can’t believe I don’t have any more Dublin Murder Squad books to read 😭 I inhaled this one, and I loved this ending to the series. Tana French is one of my favorites."
I just love Tana French. How can a 20 hr audiobook be so arresting? It just is.
This series has been such a gift. I’m sad it’s over!
Just did a re-read and had to up my rating
"Love Tana French. This book jumped the shark at one point, but I was still totally engaged. "
Flat out one of the best mystery writers out there her Dublin squad mysteries are aces I highly recommend reading them start with the first one you won't be disappointed this one was great
Per quanto avessi intuito chi fosse il cattivo questo non ha penalizzato la narrazione. Scrive in maniera. Fluida e accattivante e il racconto più va avanti e più non vorresti metterlo giù. Anche il finale per come l’ha risolto mi è piaciuto. Che dire consigliato 
So good. 
My absolute favorite book in this series ❤️
"4,5/5 ⭐️"
Oh so good.
I think this is the best since her first book In the Woods. Tana always creates wonderful characters and her writing is lovely.
"The Trespasser is the sixth book in the Murder Squad series set in Ireland – a somewhat lose collection, with each book readable as a standalone. I’ve only read three, but this is by far the strongest. My issue with the other two was that they were overly descriptive and too long and could, in my view, have benefitted from an edit. This instalment also suffers a little from being overly drawn-out – French includes every single aspect of the case including full ‘unedited’ accounts of every sentence in every interview, all of Conway’s thoughts, rich descriptions of context and scenes, detailed explanations of procedural elements, etc. – but it is fully absorbing. The microscopic detail simply adds to the tension. This is aided by close attention to office politics and psychology and strong characterisation and character development, especially of Detective Antionette Conway, the first person protagonist. Complex and abrasive, Conway is alive on the page. The plot was a relatively straightforward police procedural with a well-telegraphed twist and a nice denouement, but it’s telling is beautifully executed. Indeed, The Trespasser is a wonderfully written, multilayered and intense tale that had me hooked from the start and never let go. Certainly the best Irish police procedural I’ve read in quite a while."
"Aside from books #3 and #4, every time I finished one of Tana French's books I thought, ""This one is my favorite."" This time is no different. "
I enjoy all her books but this one I couldn't out down. 
"OH MY GOSH!!!

This is such a great story. With the previous book introducing us to Conway and letting her annoy us for at least a book and a half, it's amazing to listen to a character' growth. No, really, Conway grows up A LOT during this book.

There is no shared POV in this one which normally I would dislike but in this instance it works.

The mystery holds for as long as French can and while we all know how much I hate red herrings in my thrillers, in this book, it works. We know what Conway knows.

The end is shattering and I can't say anything at all about it because no spoilers.

Brilliant."
"This was the most SATISFYING book French has written. Please PLEASE French, break your rule and write another book about Conway or Moran. "
Conway and Moran are such a great detective duo. I'm reading these books all out of order but I'm enjoying them regardless.
Couldn’t put this one down. 
"Tana French = THE MASTER. (Not the evil one from Doctor Who, I just mean she is aMAzing at what she does.) I found the case in this one a little weak, but that didn't even upset me because the unfolding of it was so well-crafted. And HOW AWESOMELY TOUGH IS ANTOINETTE?? I love her unreliable perspective the most. Also I confess I began drawing little friendship- hearts around her and Steven at some point: best partners ever or best partners ever?"
"Oh man, I think I liked this one better than The Likeness. French is a friggin genius."
"Awesome!

I could seriously hardly put this one down! All I could think about for a couple of days... She’s become one of my fave authors."
I thought I had this one figured out about a third of the way in and then French threw in one hell of a wibbly. Very good.
"Well, my favorite two books of this collection were the two written from female perspectives. Go figure."
This is great crime writing. Can't wait to read more.
"The final book of DMS series did NOT disappoint. I love being inside the Murder D’s mind and working through the thriller who-done-it along side them.

Tana French writes a wickedly good story worth every second spent reading. Definitely one of my top favorite authors.

It’s time to try a Blake Crouch book, Abandon, but I’ll be back to French after that."
I loved living in Antoinette’s head for this one! Great mystery and great partner dynamics.
I think this may be Tana French's best story yet!
"Another amazing Murder squad story by Tana French

One of my favorite murder mystery series! Just as good as her last, this time with Detective Conway and her partner, Steve Moran."
"Five stars

⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️

If you like a whodunnit, read this one. Can’t wait to read more Tana French!"
"This is the sixth in the Dublin Murder Squad Series, a book I gave five stars. The main characters Antoinette and Stephen are detectives on the murder squad and are portrayed as many-faceted and complex characters, which gives the crime novel an added advantage. Antoinette is fairly new on the squad and has had to put up with taunts and pranks from her fellow detectives that were meant to deride and harass her as not only a newbie but as female. Her instincts propel her forward in spite of everything and in the end, change her mind about leaving the force. "
"One of the best detective books I have ever read, and I've read a lot. Loved the main characters sassy attitude, and the plot twists and turns. A must read."
"Great book! Solid mystery, good red herrings, satisfying twist. Really enjoyed it. Lot of cursing which was a little much but other than that, a great book."
WOW.
"My first Tana French ""Dublin Murder Squad"" and I'm hooked. Great great read!"
"I was convinced I was giving this 4, 4.5 stars all the way to the last page.

That's the thing about Tana French. She slow-burns you all the way. All the excitement is over and done with before you ever start reading. It's just the victim, the detectives, and you. And a whole bunch of psychological stuff that concerns everybody, including the reader.

In every one of these six books, at some point, I've said: ""Wait a minute, wow. That's me. I've been there, thought that, done that, could have done that, might've said that, IF. . .""

And that's where Tana French gets you and nails you down. Them in Dublin, me in Texas, you wherever.

Does it matter? We are every man. Or, in my case, every woman.

Those little things that can make or break a person literally balance on the hair's breadth of a razor's edge.

These books have all seemed to take forever to read for me. Not because they are boring or bad, obviously, but because the human insight involved is just so stunningly accurate, and. . .common. It's not the big dramas that land us in the dirt and prove our downfall. It's in the everyday decisions.

We hold ourselves apart, and we say, ""Not me. Never happen.""

And Tana French says, ""Oh, but, yes, it can. Let me show you how, in 450 pages, give or take.""

And I agree."
"There are moments of sadness in any life, points of realisation: these often come on the bleakest of days, days when the grey external world comes into perfect alignment with the psychological landscape of your interior, when everything clicks together with a resounding clunk, and you realise that something is over, and that the future, unwritten as it is, has absolutely nothing of interest with which to populate itself. For me, one such moment came about ten years ago: I was in hospital, recovering from a shattered arm and withdrawing from the morphine I hadn’t yet worked out I’d quickly become addicted to, when a friend from a twelve step program came to visit. It was a grey and miserable Sunday afternoon, I hadn’t seen anyone not in a uniform or a white coat for days, and he sat there and told me a story he’d heard at a meeting the night before, a particularly horrible one about somebody being stomped to death in a bail hostel, his brains all over the floor and the perpetrator’s shoes. Then he left, he had things to do, and I was alone again, in the grip of the horrors, hopelessly lost. Another such moment occurred today, on an identically monochrome Sunday afternoon, when I finished my last Tana French novel, The Trespasser, book number six in her Dublin Murder Squad series.

I suppose the above is a little melodramatic, if true: French is young and still working, it won’t be her last novel, I just have to wait, but there’s nonetheless something about discovering a new literary series of such high quality, and consuming it voraciously, that makes that grey world go away, and you don’t want it to ever end, even temporarily. While the quality of the series, and of the standalone The Wych Elm, has varied ever so slightly, I wouldn’t call even one of them patchy, nor would I describe any of them as putdownable. In The Trespasser, Detective Antoinette Conway, who we first met in The Secret Place, her incipient career stalling, is presented with what ostensibly seems to be a sickeningly routine domestic violence killing, but the case soon becomes incredibly complex, with ramifications that will make or break her. She’s assisted by the narrator of The Secret Place, Stephen Moran, and their professional relationship – at first shaky in the aforementioned novel, but rock solid when we come in here – begins to suffer, as they come up against the slimy and sinister Detective Breslin, and his friend and associate McCann, who stymie them, give them the runaround, and present them with obfuscation at each and every turn. I won’t give out any more details at this stage, nobody likes a spoiler, suffice it to say that the dead woman, Aislinn Murray, found next to the fireplace of her Dublin cottage with a broken jaw and head, is somebody with both an unhappy past and a shady present. She’s also someone who appears to have managed to completely reinvent herself, which must surely represent a chink in the seemingly-impenetrable armour of this mystery for any detective worth their salt, which Conway and Moran most certainly are.

The unreliability of both memory and perception are a constant theme throughout French’s work, and The Trespasser is no exception. In an interview with The Irish Times in February of last year, French said that she was affected by reading Stephen King’s It as a teenager, and that the inability of the characters therein to remember the traumatic events of their childhoods is something that has stayed with her. For Aislinn Murray it was more a case of her being unable to forget, but the parcelling away of past deeds into compartments of convenience comes back to haunt and destroy one grizzled old detective, who eventually becomes a suspect. What’s also interesting to me is that, in that Irish Times interview, French claims that, like King, she doesn’t plot in advance, believing instead that plot comes from character; plot comes out of character as far as I’m concerned, she says, I have to write [characters] for a while to figure out who they are. All of her work is clearly character-driven, but the plotting here (and elsewhere) is so intricate and expertly handled, that I can’t quite get my head around that idea. Maybe that’s second or third draft stuff though, or perhaps she’s just a natural; I’m kind of suspecting the latter.

So, for a return to the Dublin Murder Squad, I suppose, like everyone else, I’ll just have to sit and wait. Fortunately, there’s a new Lawrence Block/Matt Scudder novella in my to-read pile, as well as Emma Jane Unsworth’s Animals, and, if all else fails, I can go back to the beginning, and re-read In The Woods. The Trespasser, Five stars."
"So good. I was so sad to finish up with this Dublin Murder Series, and I highly recommend this series to anyone who is into shows like Law and Order (like I am). So much character development and dialogue between partners. So, so satisfying. "
"This was an AMAZING book --- could barely put it down. I am actually SAD that this is the last French book I had to read -- have now officially read all of them. This one did not disappoint -- great character development and left me guessing until the last 50 pages or so. I LOVE her writing and this was no exception --- best one since In The Woods! Tana, please write another soonest!
"
"I’ve got to stop reading Tana French novels. This one wrecked my head. I had to take the day off work to finish listening to it, despite all the other clamoring demands in my life. As Antoinette says, “I eat danger with a spoon”. Had me hooked at that line about 5 hours into the audiobook. The author’s complicated main characters are so deep - and surprisingly laugh-out-loud funny too. "
Probably the best Tana French so far. 
Had me wondering right till the very end and I like that!
"This is probably my second-favorite Tana French book after In The Woods. Loved the main character, Detective Antionette, and all of her angst. It's hard to enjoy other detective thrillers because French sets the bar so high with her well written characters."
"The latest book in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series is possibly my favorite so far. It's not a fast paced story with action on every page (if you're looking for that try a different author) but a character driven, complex murder mystery with some of the most intense scenes I've ever come across. It definitely reminded me just what I love so much about her writing.

I've been a big fan of Tana French's books for many years. Her first book In The Woods was truly gripping and second book The Likeness was even better. I did find however that the subsequent books weren't quite as good (mostly due to main characters I couldn't relate to) and it made me that little bit wary of The Trespasser. I knew I could depend on French to write believable and realistic characters and a clever story but was concerned that yet again I wouldn't like the main character and would find it a little hard going.

Thankfully however this was not the case. From the very first page I loved Detective Antionette Conway. She's tough, cynical and good at her job but due to the continued harassment, vicious pranks and terrible cases she gets at work is close to breaking point. An unstable lead detective is a common feature of French's books and for me it's always the highlight. Even though it is a regular theme however, I found that I could really relate to Antoinette and while I didn't necessarily agree with how she dealt with things I could definitely understand the reasons behind her actions.

The fact that she is so seemingly unstable and appears to be hated by everyone on the squad (with the exception of partner Stephen Moran) adds so much complexity to this story. She trusts no one and suspects everyone. When she and partner Moran receive what should be a straightforward murder case she's immediately suspicious when her boss assigns another detective to shadow them. Is there more to this case than meets the eye, are they using it to find a way to get her off the squad or is she just paranoid and over reacting?

It does initially seem like a by the numbers case with an obvious suspect but this is a Tana French book and nothing is ever that straightforward, or is it? This book literally had me questioning everything. It is very much a police procedural, they visit the scene of the crime, look at the evidence and interview suspects and friends of the victim but there is a layer of underlying tension that runs throughout that makes even the most mundane activities feel loaded and intense. There are many twists and turns in the story and the odd red herring to throw you completely off track. It definitely keeps you guessing until the very end and honestly I think I changed my mind about who did it every other chapter.

Conway is not the only complex character in this story either. A lot of thought and detail has gone into every single person who features and each one of them feels real and believable. There are no stereotypes and everyone has their faults and virtues. The relationships and interactions between them are also well crafted and I particularly loved the partnership between Conway and Moran and how it changes and develops throughout the story.

Probably the biggest highlight of this book for me however were the interview scenes. I swear with hand on heart that I don't think I've ever read (or even watched) anything quite so intense. There is one scene in particular towards the end of the book where they are interviewing a suspect which literally blew me away. The writing and changing dynamics between those in the room had me holding my breath. This book is worth reading for that scene alone.

Overall, I absolutely loved this book and would recommend everyone read. It is the 6th in the series but there are different main characters in each book and very little overlap between them so they can be read out of sequence or as stand alones (I haven't read book 5 yet).

Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review."
What a great who done it! The investigation is very well written and a surprise. I love the way Tana draws me into the case. 
"A slow start, but oh what wonderful twists and turns in this marvelous book! Detectives Conway and Moran are assigned to investigate what looks like a cut and dried domestic murder, but the pieces don't quite fit. "
"I am a HUGE Tana French fan! I started reading her books early 2014 and spaced them out so I'd have something to look forward to every few months. I read her 5th book The Secret Place in March this year and I was devastated that it would be my last French book for a while. Until a few days later I discovered this book, The Trespasser, was coming out! And after finding out that Detective Antoinette Conway, who was partnered up with Detective Stephen Moran in The Secret Place, was the narrator of this book, there was NO way I was waiting to read this book, I had to have it as soon as I could!

The story starts early one morning, when Antoinette and her partner Stephen Moran are given a case just before they are due to go off shift. Texts on the victim's phone show that she was supposed to have dinner at her house with a man, so the case looks to be a lovers' tiff turned sour; the man lashed out at the woman, who fell and smashed her head open. But certain things don't add up. Her best friend alludes to her having another secret boyfriend, the house has been wiped clean and then there's the mysterious phone call that alerted the police to the crime in the first place. Antoinette and Stephen dig deeper and find that this isn't the typical couples argument gone wrong. The story kept me hooked right til the end. We start to find out the truth near the end, with 100 pages or so left to go, but there's just so much that could change that I was gripped as I had no idea which way it was going to twist again. French is just so perfect at writing these kind of plots, all these layers that get peeled away until you have the answer in your hand but not the final outcome or consequences.

Antoinette is a tough cookie, she's sarcastic, independent and a little difficult. She usually takes no shit but is finding it hard to fit into the Murder Squad and things keep happening. Not getting information passed on to her, pages in her reports going missing, nasty rumours, silence the second she walks into the squad road. Is it because she's a woman? Is it because she's difficult and awkward to work with? Is her fuck off attitude causing this rift in the squad or is it a result of the squad treating her this way? Either way, Antoinette keeps it to herself, rarely saying anything to her partner Stephen Moran. She's a complex character who has a slight chip on her shoulder, a combination of the fact of never knowing her father or anything about him (except for his mysterious ethnicity making her a darker skin tone), growing up poor with a single mother and now being the only woman in the Murder Squad boys club. It was hard to be in her head at times as her issues with not gelling in the Murder Squad has seriously messed with her head and who she trusts (including herself). Inside she's a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. Outside she only ever shows anger, which just adds to her being standoffish and difficult to work with. But it was also fascinating being in her head and French just nails her voice, I could hear it lifting off the page and into my ear. I really rooted for her and I also loved her relationship with Stephen Moran (which I also enjoyed in The Secret Place). Their partnership is wonderful and I would love to see more of it in other books, which I sadly doubt will ever happen as French has yet to use the same narrator twice. I do hope to see glimpses of them in future books though, I'll be left wondering when the next book will be out and who will be the narrator!"
"I adore Tana French, and her latest mystery didn't let me down. Although I would read a paragragh or 2 at red lights, I put it down for about 12 hours because I wasn't ready to finish it. "
"Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad Series are usually gentle stories about decent people caught up in bad situations. Her earlier Secret Places was not in the Dublin series but it was a well deserved Edgar Prize winner. Now she ratchets it up a step or two.

The Trespasser (2016) is an powerful tale of police angst and wrong guesses on the Murder Squad of Dublin’s Garda. It starts with what seems to be a simple murder but grows into a story of intense inner and internecine conflict with a big dollop of the frosting of police bad behavior. It will hold your attention, yeah.

Antoinette Conway is female, black, and a lead detective in Dublin’s Murder Squad. Antoinette is burned out by the brutality and lies, filled with anger at the world around her, tired of the daily harassment by her white and male colleagues, and hard as nails. Her partner is Steve Moran, a very smart nice guy who tempers Conway’s anger and uses his empathy to play the good cop to Antoinette’s bad cop, but.

Their latest case is the murder of a 26-year old woman named Aislinn Murray, just. The murder is in her own home, where she has been punched in the face and has fallen against the hearth (manslaughter) or has fallen against the hearth and then been punched in the face (murder). On the night of Aislinn’s death she had an 8:00 date for dinner at her house: Rory Fallon arrived at 8:00 and rang the bell, but the just-dead Aislinn didn’t answer. Let’s see—had a date at 8:00 and Aislinn died just before 8:00? Yep, this puts Rory in the crosshairs. He is called in to Dublin Castle for a meet-and-greet.

The interviewers are Antoinette and, in rotation, Steve Moran and an older Garda named Don Breslin. Breslin is an arrogant asshole with a big smile and a sharp knife for your back Breslin really likes Rory for the murder. Steve thinks Rory is innocent though guilty on grounds of stupidity. Antoinette is just sickened by the weakness she sees in both Aislinn and Rory. They both should just Man Up! Oh, that’s right, it’s a bit late for Aislinn.

The meet-and-greet with Rory is a deftly described and a bone chilling portrayal of police methods. From now on I’ll be asking for a lawyer right out of the box! But in another more relaxed interview, Antoinette talks with Aislinn’s best friend, Lucy Riordan, who says that Aislinn might have had a guy on the side—an older guy—Antoinette senses that Lucy is wanting to say much more than she’s saying. One useful tidbit is that Aislinn’s father took a skip when she was nine and Aislinn has looked for him to return ever since. We follow Antoinette into the archives to find out what happened to Dad, and she does. Her interest is probably piqued by her own father’s walk when she was young.

So here’s the recipe: A very good but very unhappy lead Detective who has no sympathy for anyone but just wants to get it right (Antoinette Conway); A target who claims innocence but is put at Aislinn’s house at the right time (Rory Fallon); a detective who jumps at the opportunity to put Fallon away based on “shit loads” of circumstantial evidence (Breslin); another detective who thinks Fallon is probably innocent (Steve Moran); a dead girl whose specialty turns out to be male manipulation (Aislinn Murray); and a friend of the dead girl who wants to say more than she does but is prevented by extraneous circumstances (Lucy).

Mix it all together, sprinkle in liberal doses of great writing, add surprises and stir vigorously, just. You’ve got a great thriller.

Five Stars.

"The Trespasser and In the Woods are her two best of the Dublin Murder Mystery series. It ended the only way it could end, there was an inevitability to it that I found pleasing."
Very good 
"Tana French ist wieder da! Nachdem Der geheime Ort mich doch sehr enttäuscht hat, ist Tana French mit The Trespasser wieder ganz oben bei mir.

Hauptperson ist diesmal Antoinette Conway, aka Badass Cop, und mann, ist die einfach mal geil. Ja, sie hat auch nervige Seiten, sie hat mich manchmal angepisst, sie kann sehr stur sein, aber am Ende des Tages ist sie BADASS COP. Sie und Steve Moran, der im letzten Buch voll der Langweiler war (hat sich aber deutlich gebessert in diesem Buch - wahrscheinlich weil nicht aus seiner Sicht geschrieben wurde), sind ein klasse Team. Ich will mehr Bücher mit Conway. Okay, ich will einfach nur ein weiteres Buch von French - fragt sich nur, wer dann Hauptcharakter ist, einer von den Floatern?

Zurück zu The Trespasser. Handlung: 1 A. Ich dachte ehrlich, das würde in 'ne andere Richtung gehen xD
Ich hab darauf gesetzt, dass French uns schocken will und dachte mir: ""Jo, das wäre voll der Schocker!"", sodass ich mich total darauf fixiert war und als sie am Ende dann zwar immer noch 'nen Schocker, aber nicht meinen natürlich ^^, gezogen hat, tja, also, da war ich ganz baff xD

Schreibstil: wie immer klasse. Der geheime Ort war in dem Fall kein Ausreißer. Wenn man von der Jugendsprache und der langweiligen Charakterisierung und der Handlung absieht - Schreibstil immer noch klasse und sehr einnehmend. Du bist so tief in der Geschichte drin, so wie Tana French schreibt, mein Herz hat die ganze Zeit vor Spannung und Aufregung gepocht. Ich muss aber auch zugegeben, es lag auch daran, dass ich die ganze Zeit Schiss hatte, was mit Conway und Moran passieren könnte, so wie ich Tana French kenne, würden sie am Ende des Buches so verdammt traumatisiert sein oder jedenfalls ziemlich abgefuckt, deswegen auch das Herzklopfen.

Ist aber alles gut gegangen. Oder doch nicht? Was sitzt du denn da noch so rum, finde es selbst heraus, aber dalli! :D"
"Tana French's novels are always about stories. Not the obvious kind that exist because we're reading a novel, but the stories we tell ourselves to get through the day, the ones that reassure us that our work is meaningful, that our life has a purpose, and that sometimes allow us to forgive ourselves despite having done terrible things. ""The Trespasser"" is French's most explicit examination of these issues, and she does it with her usual ability to conjure great characters who live in a world that's determined to break down all of their narrative defenses, all those tiny walls that give them a bit of calm and safety when everything else is falling apart minute by minute.

Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are still rookies on the Dublin Murder Squad, and both face a squad room full of senior detectives who absolutely do not want to make it easy on them. Conway, as a woman, gets extra special attention, which essentially leaves her wondering how she can trust her fellow detectives at all. Solving murders is hard enough; doing so when others try to sabotage her cases is unbearably traumatizing. It doesn't help that Conway has her own story of childhood trauma and is not inclined to trust others even in normal circumstances. Conway narrates this novel, and French is canny enough to get the reader to wonder if the narrative twists and mental manipulations in this book are partly due to Conway's misinterpretations of events. As with any mystery by Tana French, there's no easy answer at the end.

As a reader, I found ""The Trespasser"" to be a bit slow, at least compared to ""In the Woods"" and ""The Likeness,"" but it offers many other thrills and pleasures that should keep anyone more than engaged and waiting desperately for the conclusion. There's a lot more time spent on examining dead ends, coming up with theories, and generally making the reader ask what the hell is going on. But, especially by the end, there's no way you can drop the novel down and move away because it's just too riveting. As usual with French, the culprit is not really hidden behind a pile of typical mystery devices. You can probably guess who did it a long time before it becomes ""official."" French always cares more about the psychological toll that her fictional crimes impose upon her central characters. And in that sense, ""The Trespasser"" may be the most brutal of all her work. You'll understand what I mean when you get to that final chapter.

If you haven't read any of Tana French's novels then I might recommend ""In the Woods"" as a better start to her series, but each novel stands on its own. There's no ongoing plot that you need to be aware of (aside from it being about detectives who work on the Dublin Murder Squad). But if you pick up ""The Trespasser"" and don't expect the typical mystery novel, then you'll be happy, and will hopefully check out her previous books."
"The Trespasser by Tana French was one of my favorite books of the year.

This 6th book in the author’s outstanding Dublin Murder Squad series, is narrated by Detective Antoinette Conway. Conway has attained her dream job as Detective in the elite murder squad of the Dublin police force, but lately the job has been eating away at her. Conway is no pushover, but as the only woman currently on the squad, Conway finds herself subjected to frequent harassment by some of her fellow officers. She has a great partner in Detective Stephen Moran, but their boss seems to be throwing too many routine domestic cases their way to suit her. Conway longs for a case with more substance. When yet another domestic lands on Conway’s desk, she is well beyond exasperated. This new case, however, takes some surprising turns and Conway and Moran suddenly find themselves in complicated, uncharted territory.

The audio version of The Trespasser is wonderfully read by Hilda Fay. Her interpretation, complete with an array of Irish accents, enhance this already fine novel.
"
Once again Tana French has written a masterpiece dealing with relationships in the context of a well written history. I highly recommend this book.
"Tana French Delivers - Again

A simple domestic murder case ensnares a young female detective of color in a web of Dublin Murder Squad intrigue. Tana French delivers characters and plot with equal doses of mastery. If you've never read her before, time to start. If you're already a fan, you won't be disappointed."
"Oh man, I envy the person who hasn’t started reading Tana French. (If you haven’t, you should, and start with In The Woods and go from there). This was a perfect crime novel — twisty and turny and filled with multiple levels of interesting things: the squad room drama, the mystery surrounding the victim, the red herrings, the big reveal — all of it, perfect. Absorbing, entertaining, dark and heavy yet moving along at such a clip you can hardly put it down. On a related note, I really love how each novel has a different narrator, minor characters turned into major ones, sidekicks becoming the main show. Clever and interesting. Fantastic writing, amazing plotting — the sort of book that makes me wish with all my might that I could have been a writer like this. Brilliant. "
"This was my first book by Tana French and I’m honestly in love! I didn’t really care for the main character that much, but the storyline was intense! Amazing writing! Definitely will check out other books by her"
"Um, CLEARLY I'm dropping every book I've already started reading to read this one instead. I'll get back to you, other books, I swear!
_____

It took me awhile to get fully invested in this one for some reason. I love Conway and Moran as partners, and how they bounce things off of each other and how they joke around and how they argue, and how they deal with the other members of the squad. I also kind of loved Conway's interactions with Breslin--how they circle each other, both trying to get the upper hand, but how well they work together in the interrogation room as well. But most of French's characters have more moments of reflection and self discovery than Conway seems to, and I found myself missing that--or, just missing more about what was going on outside of the police work.

But around the halfway mark I found myself completely hooked. Suddenly everything seemed to change, and get more tense, and the stakes get higher, and the emotional impacts seem deeper felt. And I loved how things turned out in the end. The murder mystery was not something I was able to figure out early on at all, and the characters that seem like they're the bad guys just end up seeming...human. And Conway actually thinks about the way she's been behaving and treating people, with constant suspicion and paranoia, and how that's effected her working environment and her partnership with Moran. In the end she has a hard time figuring out for sure if she's acting that way because of the sexism and racism she's encountered in Murder Squad, or whether it's the other way around, and she's made things worse for herself.

Anyway, once again probably my least favorite of the series, but I always think that of each new book as its published and then later, once the story has had time to settle, I rearrange the order in my head. Each book is so different it makes it hard to really compare!

One more thing--it's always been easy before for me to figure out which character will be the main one in the next book, but not so here. Breslin? O'Kelly? One of the floaters? Sophie? Quigley (I'm a little bit rooting for Quigley, just because he's got the same name as my dog)? I have no clue. But whichever one it is, I am 100% sure I will read it and love it just like I have all the others!"
"The only thing worse than waiting for the next book to be written is reading the next book and knowing you're in for a year, waiting for the next one, and hoping there is one.

Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are the newest Detectives within the Murder Squad.

Conway enters with an amazing chip on her shoulder, she’s absolutely convinced that she’s not going to be given a legitimate shot because she’s a woman. And she’s not wrong. Multiple tricks are played on her, documents go missing off her desk, her computer is checked out in her absence, someone even relieves themselves in her locker. All perhaps could be reasoned the result of the comradery between new and old in a historically male workplace, that could be the reason, the excuse. No question that Conway is being victimized, they want her out and she’s not going. Facing this kind of opposition daily does not make her a delightful colleague, she’s aggressive, secretive, foul mouthed and has a wicked temper.

However, her partner Stephen seems to let this all slip off his back, he treats her like a colleague and shares his thoughts with her, which drives her crazy as well, always looking for more than what’s obvious.

Conway and Moran are assigned a questionable death, Aislinn Murray has been found dead, her head smashed against a fireplace, dinner in the oven and table set for two. It’s easy to assume a tryst gone wrong, a lover’s row, not incredibly suspicious. Enter Rory Fallon, an earnest bookshop owner and Aislinn’s swain. He’s about as vicious as a new borne baby. The two detectives continue to look for other answers, even though Detective Breslin, a veteran of the squad, pushes for them to charge Rory. So, to keep the peace and keep Breslin off their backs, they run a secret investigation, sure that they don’t have the answer in Rory. As the investigation gets closer and closer to suspicion of a fellow officer, the temperature heats up as does the danger to the detective’s careers.

The progress of the investigation is fascinating, as are the secrets of interrogation we are let into. I like these two together, they are very different in temperament and it works.

"
"This is the sixth installment in Tana French’s series The Dublin Murder Squad, a crime series that differs from many others in that it doesn’t rely on a single protagonist but instead features different detectives each time; some who have been background characters in one book later become the focus in a subsequent one. This time French repeats the pairing of Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran who readers first encountered in “The Secret Place” (2014). In that story Moran narrated the case when they investigated the murder of a young boy on the grounds of an exclusive private girls’ school. This time the story comes from Conway, so both the crime and the partnership is viewed from a different perspective.

Conway has been a member of the Murder Squad for about two years, the dream job as a detective she aspired to from the time she was on the beat in uniform. But her tenure as a bi-racial woman in this exclusive club has been difficult. She endured the initial hazing which she expected, but that has since descended into outright abuse. Every time she walks into the squad room she is greeted with silence. Insults have become vicious attacks and the detectives appear to be taking delight in sabotaging her work, stealing witness statements from her desk, deleting documents on her computer, dropping her phone in her coffee cup or spitting in it and even peeing in her locker. They want her to fail and watch while she does it, but she been tough and taken it all, determined to show them she can be a topnotch detective. After months of such abuse and seeing enemies everywhere, Conway is getting tired of it, becoming paranoid and wondering how much more she can put up with despite her love of the job. Her only port in the storm is her partner Stephen, who she trusts. They work well together, although there are times when she wonders if even he is against her.

Coming off a long late-night shift, Conway and Moran are handed another case of domestic violence which looks like it can be dispatched quickly. Both are disappointed to be stuck with another case of drunken violence and domestic killing. Conway hates these kinds of cases which increase her solve rate but gain her little respect with the squad. She wants a more complicated murder she can sink her teeth into. This time gaffer O’Kelly has also assigned Detective Breslin, a more experienced detective, to the case which Conway finds this annoying. However, O’Kelly makes it clear that Breslin is there to assist, that this is Conway’s case and she is in charge.

When Conway and Moran arrive at Aislinn Murray’s cottage, they find the pretty young victim dead on the floor, her head smashed against the stone fireplace. There is a burned dinner in the oven and a table set for a romantic dinner for two. The death appears to be the result of a lovers’ argument and Rory Fallon, Aislinn’s dinner date that evening, becomes the prime suspect. The assumption is he lost his temper for some reason, punched Ainslee in the jaw and knocked her down. When she fell, she hit her head on the edge of the fireplace, inflicting the wound that caused her death.

Detective Breslin aggressively pushes Conway and Moran to move on and close the case quickly, bullying them and questioning every move Conway makes. But when some of the evidence doesn’t match up, Conway and Moran look deeper. Things are complicated by the lack of forensic evidence and the hints from one of Aislinn’s friends she may have had a secret boyfriend. Then there is that niggle in Conway’s memory that she has met this woman sometime in her past, but can’t quite place her. Conway also fears Breslin has an ulterior motive, that he is pushing her to make a career ending mistake and get her booted from the squad.

There are so many questions hovering in Conway’s head. She wonders why they were handed this case just after finishing a shift, why Breslin was assigned to help them and why all the evidence doesn’t fit what appears to be a simple crime. With only circumstantial evidence pinning Rory Fallon to the crime, Conway and Stephen discuss other possible theories, which leads them down a dark rabbit hole of the possibilities of bent cops, bribes and gangsters. Conway tries to keep Detective Breslin at arm’s length, holding her ground while he laughs, criticizes her leadership and tries to take over the investigation.

French describes the intense claustrophobic atmosphere of the murder squad, a hostile place with its internal politics and its own language, as Conway’s difficult experiences pushes her interior monologues further and further into a world of threats, suspicion, tension and paranoia. But the highlight of the book are the scenes of the interviews, the elaborately staged interrogations detectives use to manipulate their suspects to reveal their secrets. They know how to put their suspects at ease and grill them, using the tricks they have honed for years. Each detective has his own way of interrogating a witness or suspect, a way which suits his personality, works for him and has become his standard modus operandi. These scenes, often more than five pages long and full of detail, are so well done that French maintains the tension and readers can almost feel the pressure of those forced under the spotlight, impelled by fear to say things they had promised themselves never to reveal.

There is a subtle underlying piece to the narrative which French initially hints at and later exposes. Both Aislinn and Antoinette were abandoned by their fathers, a fact which has impacted their lives in different ways. Although Conway initially finds Ainslee a pathetic figure, she changes her mind once she understands the entire arc of her story.

Some have criticized the length of this book, but French uses every page to her advantage, immersing readers in the Dublin setting with its food, pubs, slang and distinctive dialect, placing them in the tense atmosphere of the murder room where powerful men play out hidden agendas and explaining why Conway’s job means so much to her. She also wants readers to understand why Conway’s relationship with Moran works and why sometimes it doesn’t, why she trusts him and why Stephen continues to work with her despite her quick temper and her erratic and often surly behavior.

Initially I wondered at the title and how it fit, but as the story of the crime unfolds it is slipped into a minor but important piece of evidence. It may also refer to a sin against someone from a person who they trusted, from the biblical reference “those who trespass against us”.

French’s work challenges the notion that crime stories are not literary fiction and often considered easy reads. Her novels show why she has won awards for her beautiful writing, her finely drawn sense of place, original plots, solid pacing and complex characters, all done without graphic sex and violent gory details.

This is another complex, multi-layered mystery to add to the series which continues to gain the respect of readers and critics alike. It was an excellent read.

"I am a big fan of Tana French. In fact, she's the only author I regularly turn to in the mystery genre. She creates such psychologically rich characters, which, for me, is the appeal. Unlike many writers in the genre, French eschews the franchise approach. That's to say, we get a new protagonist each time she adds to her Dublin Murder Squad series. This time the narrative voice belongs to Antoinette Conway, a black detective on the murder squad whose partner is Stephen Moran (the detective and narrator from French's last book, A Secret Place). Conway is edgy, suspicious, an outsider in this world of white males. She's fed up with being treated like shite and is seriously considering an offer she's had for a cushy security job. Conway and Moran are wrapping up a night shift when their gaffer (commander) hands off a case to them that they assume is a domestic dispute gone all wrong.

The victim is Ainslinn Murray, a young, pretty woman who's discovered in her home with a bashed in head and a punch-bruised face. All signs point to her new-ish guy Rory Fallon, a nerdy bookstore owner with stalker proclivities. Conway and Moran get pressure to pin the murder on Rory from a senior detective, Breslin, who's been assigned to assist them on the case. We all know, however, that easy solves don't make good detective stories. The tension between Conway/Moran and Breslin drives the narrative.

That's as much plot summary as I'll provide ('cause you can find more elsewhere). The Trespasser had me enthralled from start to finish. If you're seeking some escapist reading that's way less scarier than current goings on in our nation's capitol, you can't go wrong."
"I would like to thank Netgalley and Hodder & Stoughton for an advance copy of The Trespasser, the sixth outing for Ms French's Dublin Murder Squad series.

As usual Ms French makes the lead detective in her novel a lesser character from the previous novel and in The Trespasser it is the turn of Antoinette Conway and her sidekick, Steve Moran. As junior members of the squad they get the grunt work, mostly open and shut domestics, and it is no different when they are sent to investigate the death of Aislinn Murray who has been punched and dies when her head hits the fireplace surround. As this is quite a long book there is obviously much more to this case than first impressions would suggest. Aislinn had been due to entertain her boyfriend, Rory Fallon, who claims she didn't answer the door and Breslin, a senior detective helping them out, insists it is him although Moran and Conway, to a lesser extent, have doubts. It takes them a while to sort through the lies, half truths and evasions.

I picked up In The Woods on spec in the supermarket when it came out and was extremely impressed to the extent that I eagerly await every new instalment. The Trespasser has not let me down as it is a great read with a relatively simple plot premise which twists and turns constantly, keeping you on your toes intellectually and shredding your nerves with tension.

I think much of the power in the novel comes from the characterisation as very few of the characters are consistent in their views or actions, for example Antoinette keeps changing her mind about Rory's guilt. Add in to this the fact that she thinks the squad is out to get her and sees conspiracy theories everywhere and you have a cracking novel of shifting perspectives, paranoia and lies. It's great stuff and all too human.

It is impossible to do the novel justice in a short review so I suggest you just read it and enjoy Ms French's skill. You won't be disappointed.
"
"I was given this book by Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

I am a big fan of Tana French, and I can honestly say that this is my favourite book of hers so far. There was nothing I disliked about it.

I liked Antoinette Conway after reading The Secret Place, and I absolutely love her now. More than any other character in the Dublin Murder Squad series, Antoinette seems to personify the character of inner city Dublin as a living, breathing entity. Her MO - female detective mistreated by the boy's club and hardened into a rough, defensive loner who finds it difficult to trust anyone, even her own partner - could be considered trite if left in the hands of a less capable writer, but French nails it. Antoinette is thrown into a top-notch mystery that's so tightly wrought and well-written that your opinions on everyone, even the victim herself, will be thrown into doubt several times. This ties in nicely with Antoinette's personal story, her struggles to trust the people around her and her subsequent realisation that not everything she believes to be true is as it seems.

This book has a strong beginning, strong middle and strong end. There wasn't a weak link. One of my favourite moments is 
the final conversation between O'Kelly and McCann, and what you learn about those particular characters. It was nice to see how O'Kelly, always a background character, has developed over the timespan of six novels, and that he's willing to look out for Antoinette and Steve, regardless of how he normally acts or what they may believe. I also really enjoyed the introduction of Fleas, whom I suspect will be French's next central character. All in all, this is a fantastic novel and a personal favourite."
"Tana French and her literary mysteries is one of my ""instant read"" authors, whose book I will seek out as soon as it is published. (I was thinking about this while reading, and I think French might be my favorite mystery author.) French inhabits and creates characters that feel incredibly real, and then sets them up in a mystery that challenges the very core of their being in some way.

The protagonist of The Trespasser is Antoinette Conway from The Secret Place, returning alongside Stephen Moran. The two have started to settle into their roles as partners. However, Conway's prickly, impatient nature isn't making her any friends in the Murder Squad. This, combined with the fact that she is the only woman and person of color and a series of pranks (well, horrible pranks, so hazing really) has convinced her that unknown people are trying to drive her off.

Conway and Moran get a new case that seems cut and dry, except for someone else on the Squad seems to be pushing them towards this answer. Is there more to the case, or is someone just trying to mess with Antoinette?

This is the first book since In the Woods that focuses on a well-matched set of partners. They are much earlier in their partnership than Cassie and Rob, but I loved returning to explore the relationship between two partners. Plus, even though Conway and I have little in common (I strongly suspect I would annoy her), I loved inhabiting her head and her world for a little while.

"
"This could be the best police procedural I have ever read. It rises far above the usual in the genre and shows Tana French at her very best (so far). What seemed obsessive and irritating in her fifth book--the many, many alternate scenarios developed and explained in detail by the detectives as they and we learned more about the suspects--here becomes a strength. At the end of my review of that book I hoped to hear more about its secondary detective Antoinette Conway, and I certainly got my wish. She is the narrator of this one--an unreliable one, because she is defensive, angry, arrogant, paranoid, and occasionally cruel. And yet you're pulling for her. She is the lone dark-skinned female in a hostile white male environment, to the nth degree. This is a long book, 450 small-print pages, and I found it very hard to put down. It pretty much ate up a couple of days of my life. I was afraid until the last few pages that French was going to go all post-modern on me: since every character has their own idea of how the murder happened and the evidence is all circumstantial, we'll just have to settle for ""we can never know what actually happened--even if you had been there you wouldn't really know (eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable)--everybody's version is true for him."" But she didn't. There was a brilliant and moving conclusion that revealed the killer--a recognition scene that simultaneously answered all our questions about the main characters, resolved about four complicated plot points, and forced Antoinette to see herself and her work environment clearly for the first time. A truly amazing feat of writing. The only thing left unexplained was who might be the trespasser of the title. In some sense the term could refer to almost any of the main characters."
"Tana French is truly fantastic and nothing like any other suspense/crime fiction authors I've read to date. And of course, The Trespasser is another five-star read full of so many layers -- some surprising and unexpected, some you can feel coming but can't quite put your finger on. The last book in the Dublin Murder series truly went out with a bang.

Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are the lucky ones who get to tackle yet another lovers' quarrel gone wrong: Aislinn Murray is a young, pretty blonde found dead in her picture-perfect living room right next to a table set for a romantic dinner. Typically these cases only take as long as tracking down the boyfriend or husband or guy shagging her and getting the confession full of ""you don't understand..."" and ""I didn't mean for it to end like this...."" on tape. Except this time, Conway can't ignore the fact that she's seen Aislinn before. And that the other detectives are pushing for Conway and Moran to arrest the boyfriend even though there are leads that need to be followed. And that there's a mystery man watching her from the end of her street. And that Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger.

Meanwhile Conway is dealing with workplace harassment which has left her abrasive, untrusting of her own squad, and constantly looking over her shoulder for the next thing coming her way. Even though she's tough as well, she's continuously taking flak from the squad good ole' boys -- spit in her coffee, statement sheets gone missing, piss in her locker. She knows this is presumably to get her off of the squad one way or another as soon as possible, but she can't help but wonder if there are darker plans somewhere just out of reach.

"One thing I'll always vividly remember about this book is sitting on the tailgate of my pick up truck as I finished, and closing the book (read this one in print, as I've owned the HC for way longer than I care to admit) and loudly and clearly thinking to myself, ""This is one of the best series I'll ever read in my life.""

Tana French's writing and stories seems to be mostly hit or miss, which ... I understand? I guess? (To each their own!) But at the same time, they are absolutely so brilliant to me I can't fathom not loving them. It's complicated, whatever. Moving on.

I love, love, LOVED this book. I don't fully know how to review it, because it's in your best interest to read this series sequentially (I mean, you don't have to, but also you should) so this seems to be a review mainly for people that have already read the first 5 and are wondering if they should read this (You Should) or for people that are wondering if this series is worth starting (It Is).

Antoinette Conway was a kick-a** narrator, and I loved her relationship with Stephen. I loved the way those two played off of one another, and I loved watching Antoinette lose none of herself while finding small ways to open up. And I just freaking love Stephen Moran.

Oh, you want to know what my favorite book of the series is? OOF. Probably The Secret Place, followed by The Likeness, followed by The Trespasser? Then Faithful Place, Broken Harbor, and finally In The Woods (which is a SHAME, because it's the opener to the series and while it's GOOD it's not as good as the rest, and I'd hate to think people give up on this series because of that book.)

Long story short (Too Late), I loved this book and you should read it."
"This is yet another excellent novel from Tana French. She is one of the very best of contemporary crime writers and this is well up to standard.

The book is set, as always, in the Dublin Murder Squad. This one is told in the first person by relatively new detective Antoinette Conway, in a brilliant narrative voice. Conway is driven, determined and very, very angry with the contemptuous attitude to her which she sees in her colleagues. She has a wonderfully cynical and angry attitude much of the time, which is superbly conveyed in an utterly convincing way. The plot involves an apparently routine ""domestic"" which begins to reveal deeper forces. It moves slowly but compellingly as Conway goes down blind alleys and begins to suspect corruption and cover-up in her own squad.

Tana French does it all brilliantly. As ever, a large part of the appeal of the book is the psychology of her protagonist and other characters, and we get what turns out to be a fine portrait of the way in which the stories we tell ourselves affect the way we see the world and ultimately how we conduct our relationships and our lives. This sounds very ponderous and worthy, but it's not at all. It's an engrossing, readable book which makes its points with subtlety and as part of the story. Don't expect lots of violent action or a fast-paced plot, but there's a fine, developing sense of menace and a couple of very unexpected developments. I found it very gripping, and there are some especially brilliant interview scenes.

In short, this is an excellent novel of character as well as being a terrific crime novel. I enjoyed it enormously and I can recommend it very warmly.

Intense and engrossing The Trespasser by multi award winner Tana French comes to absorbing and sometimes frightening life when given an outstanding reading by Irish actress Hilda Fay. The streets of Dublin come alive and whispers send shivers.

Detective Antoinette Conway is unique in many ways - intelligent, intuitive and the sole woman on the Dublin murder squad. She’s partnered with Steve Moran, and they’re both weary after a long shift when they’re given what seems to be clear cut - domestic violence - Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home after an anonymous tip reports that she fell and hit her head. Not quite - the fall was caused by a swift punch to her face. A table had been set for a romantic dinner for two, hence Aislinn’s boyfriend, Rory, seems the prime suspect. However, he swears it was not him and that seems to be the case.

Following what clues they have from an encrypted file on Aislinn’s computer to strange behavior from her best friend to hints that there may have been more than one man interesting her the detectives tramp all over London to no avail. Leads take them nowhere. At this point Antoinette begins to wonder if someone does not want the case solved. Is someone in the squad sabotaging their investigation?

French is such a deft writer that as the story unfolds we are privy to Antoinette’s thoughts and feelings - is she imagining things? Is she paranoid? Has she lost the skills that made her an outstanding detective? A master craftsman at building plots and a wonderful writer French holds us in thrall until the last word.

Enjoy!"
"This book...wow!! Absolutely amazing. I will admit that it was a little slow in the beginning, difficult to get into. Yet by the end, I could not put it down. I was so desperate to know how it ended. The suspense with each page kept me turning and turning. This is a must read for anyone who likes this genre."
"Tana French is one of my favorite authors. Her characters are so well defined that you virtually climb right into the thought pattern of the speaker.

I went back and forth about four or five stars, and then I finally said, ""Oh, does it matter that much? Give it to her. It was a great book."" Sometimes I split hairs too much.

The Trespassers revolves around the murder of a 26-year-old woman who lived in the Stonybatter area of Dublin. Murder Detective Antoinette Conway delves into the life and soul of Aislinn Murphy as she tries to find her killer, all the while fending off harassment from the Murder Squad because she is a woman, because she is biracial, because she has a chip on her shoulder, because there is a perception she was moved to Murder too easily - who knows? If it weren't for her partner Steve Moran, maneuvering through the mundane aspects of solving this crime while dealing with these other problems would be too much to bear.

As the plot moves along and Antoinette and Steve unpeeled layer after layer from both Aislinn's story and that of the squad, more shadows and nuances from the past appear. Conway had been an excellent, well-liked police officer in other departments. Facts did not add up. The boyfriend was too obvious as a candidate to have done the murder.

As Antoinette begins to discover parallels in her life and Aislinn's, she is able to make a great deal of things fall into place that made me keep reading later than I should have. Story meshed with story, character with character. Simple manslaughter was not so simple after all."
"I think this is one of her better novels. As usual, she writes a psychological drama disguised as a murder mystery. The psychological insights she demonstrates always rings absolutely true. That everybody lives a story they tell themselves, with them as the hero, including the detectives. Their prime task is to sift through all the fantasies in order to find the truth, whatever that may be. A good read."
"I’m not sure why this book has not been as highly rated as French’s others, because I really liked it and found it hard to put down. This book centers prickly Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran, who are investigating the death of a young woman who seems to have fallen and hit her head in her flat on the night she had a date with a meek bookstore owner who is of course the prime suspect. The mystery is well told and intriguing, but the relationships of the people on the Murder Squad are the heart of the book.

Sorry, haters, but I like Antoinette Conway. I wouldn’t call her “whiny” because she reacts to the sexism and hostility of the men on the squad. Even if her distrust verges on paranoia at times, it is well for any woman in a male-dominated field to remember the axiom “Even paranoiacs can have real enemies.”
"
"Tana French was my first introduction to murder, mystery, crime and suspense books. I started with the first book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, LOVED IT, and continued to read them in order eagerly anticipating the next book as her writing is consistently good.
.
The Tresspasser is the latest (book 6) in the collection. I prefer to call them a collection rather then a series because of the unique way French ties the books together. In each book, French expands on a lesser character from a previous book, making the point of view in each novel change (sometimes male, sometimes female). This is why, while there is character overlap between stories, I do not feel like it's necessary to read the books in order. French's use of details to create her characters with individual personalities, humor, stubborn  streaks, and lifestyles bring these characters to life. I can almost see their manarisms materializing on the page. That is one aspect of her writing that keeps me coming back for each new story, her characterization. You end up rooting for her characters, even if they are disagreeable.
.
In The Trespassers,  we follow from the point of view of Detective Antoinette Conway. Conway feels threatened as a female detective working the night shift and is out to prove herself. She's prickly and determined. As always, French drew me in with her exceptional characterization, suspenseful twists and turns, and the big picture murder mystery. I highly recommend this, and all of her books!"
And Tana French has again blown me away.
"The Trespasser is another gem of a novel from Tana French. It features Detective Antoinette Conway and her colleague Stephen Moran and is the 7th novel in the 'Murder Squad' series, but can definitely be read as a stand alone novel. Shamefully this is only the second one of the series that I have read, and I really need to read the others!

When a young woman is found dead in her home one morning after Conway and Moran have just finished their shift, suspicion immediately falls on the victims new boyfriend. Despite having just pulled an all nighter they are both pulled head first into the investigation.

Instinctively they both realise that there is more to the case than first meets the eye. But there is pressure from above to charge the initial suspect and shut the case down. The only problem is, all the evidence is circumstantial.

As Conway and Moran do a little investigation away from the prying eyes of their senior colleagues they are left reeling at what they discover, and left questioning everything they know and have ever been taught.

Because if what they fear most is true, then where do they go from here?

The Trespasser is a long character driven novel, with more focus on the investigation and the detectives rather than the murder victim as such, but if you are looking for a healthy dose of well written literary crime fiction, the this is definitely the novel for you.

Definitely one of my favourites of this year.
"
"I absolutely love the well-developed glimpses we get into what's going on inside Antoinette Conway's thoughts. Like this description of the Murder Squad room, by our author, through Conway's eyes: ""Murder works out of the grounds of the Dublin Castle, smack in the heart of town, but our building is tucked away a few corners from the fancy stuff the tourists come to see, and our walls are thick; even the early morning traffic out on Dame Street only makes it through to us as a soft undemanding hum. The jumbles of paperwork and photos and scribbled notes left on people's desks look like they're charging up, thrumming with action waiting to happen. Outside the tall sash windows the night is thinning towards a chilled gray; the room smells of coffee and hot radiators. At that hour, if I could overlook all the ways the night shift blows, I could love the squad room."" And we know Conway loves her job, despite the royal shit her squad mates give her, the stuff harassment is made of.

Conway and victim Ainslinn Murray have something in common, something that helps Conway look at this case from the victim's viewpoint and analyze her thought process.

Conway and Steve Moran work well together until they don't. Boss Breslin is happy about the break in their congenial work relations. Some things are afoot. Good murder detectives, like Conway and Moran, don't give up.


Thanks to NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
"Tana French is so good it's barely legal.
She takes what could be claimed 'an overfull genre', in the field of police procedural, and makes it fresh again.
Her Dublin Murder Squad mysteries can be read as consecutive thrillers or stand alone, a feat in itself if you manage to read just one of her books (been reading her from Day 1 and each new book is a 'must buy') and this is number 6.
Antoinette Conway (introduced in The Secret Place) is desperate to be lead on a case ,the only problem being that no one wants to work with her. Systematically bullied but not wanting to give in she is an angry narrator as she tries to work out who killed a young woman, in her home, apparently made up and ready for a date to arrive.
Was it the man who autonomously phoned in the death, the man she was planning on meeting or someone else all together?
A small detail suddenly brings the case into frightening relief for Antoinette as she recognises the victim's face and suddenly she is fighting to bring a killer to justice as well as fighting for her place in the squad.
The narrator is often so abrasive you can almost understand why the ridicule gets piled on her, she seems almost like an automaton but she is not in the job to be liked, she is there to get the case closed.
Another cracking read, thanks to Netgalley for the chance to review it."
"I listened to this 20-hour audiobook in the space of a workweek. I was completely gripped by it. It reminded me in a lot of different ways of parts of her other novels, but that's not a criticism - the way intimacy, longing and anxiety are portrayed so vividly is Tana French at her best. Even situations that should be absurd (see the entire premise of The Likeness - which I adored) somehow feel real and believable when she's the one writing them.

As with many of her other books, I guessed at least part of ""whodunnit"" earlier on in the novel, but it didn't matter. I was still on the edge of my seat right up until the end to see how it would play out. The story comes back again and again to competing narratives, putting the whole thing on shifting sand, and it's tense, unsettling and utterly compelling.

Conway is one of my favourite protagonists so far, and I love the partnership between her and Moran. She's tough in a way that could be bland ""strong female character"", but she has far more depth than that, and I hope we get to see more of her.

I'm tempted to reread the whole series again just to help me get through the next few years before (hopefully?) another one comes out."
"Tana French has written a mystery worthy of her talent and readers. After the pallid stylings of The Secret Place, The Trespasser is full of the zest and vigour of French's best writing. We once again meet Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran, now a member of the Murder squad. I felt that Antoinette Conway's character was given short shrift in The Secret Place, here French develops her into a complex character with flashes of brilliance, dogged hard work and enough resentments to start an AA group all on her own. As a reader, I cheered for her to find her way and winced the times she shot herself in the foot. Her self perception of a squad out to oust her from their ranks provides the reader with a fascinating slice of reality checking. Moran is well-drawn as her partner, but very much a go-along, get-along kind of guy accepted by all the squad members.

The murder of a young woman in her locked home as she is preparing dinner for a promising date is at the heart of this book. Along the way, we meet the members of the Murder squad, the hapless young man who was to be the victim's date, her best girlfriend, a presumptuous millenial reporter trying for ""the big story"", the families of the aforementioned characters as well as the family of Detective Conway. French leads us all over Dublin in pursuit of the guilty party and it's a tantalizing jaunt. Don't miss this one."
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
Yesssssssssssss
!!!!!!!!!

I LOVED this story! I listened on Audible, and the narration was superb! The characters Conway and Moran really stuck with me ever since the previous book, in the all girls school (will come back and add the title if I remember to).

Conway is truly going THROUGH IT. Working in a field overrun with men, all kinds of
Men- men who hate women, men who take out their frustrations in the form of sexual harassment in the workplace (and even worse). I had SUCH compassion for Conway, but also had the sense of “she can handle this (even though she shouldn’t have too) I never faltered in my view that SHE GOT THIS! Although the author does make you second guess everyone/thing as the plot unfolds, I truly thought I knew who the killer was before Tana wanted us guessing… thought I was so smart but turns out I had the wrong person anyway! This is what Tana French is so good at, digging into police interviews and pulling tidbits out, adding tidbits in, just enough that I am always second guessing everything and EVERYONE is a suspect!!!

Moran is a gentle but SMART giant, he and Conway make such a grand partnership!

I did feel as though the part about her father could have been left out of the book, but I understand why it was included.

All in all, 5/5 stars in my opinion!"
"“No one needs a relationship. What you need is the basic cop-on to figure that out, in the face of all the media bullshit screaming that you're nothing on your own and you're a dangerous freak if you disagree. The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all. And that doesn't just go for romance. I love my ma, I love my friends, I love the bones of them. If any of them wanted me to donate a kidney or crack a few heads, I'd do it, no questions asked. And if they all waved good-bye and walked out of my life tomorrow, I'd still be the same person I am today.”

Tana French has done it again. I fell head over heels in love with her writing from the moment I read her first book in Dublin Murder Squad series, and here she is, five books later, and she hasn't lost her edge. In fact, she's sharpened it. The lady just knows how people tick; what they're thinking, their loves and hates, their motivations, ALL of it. But this book is more than just an intricately woven narrative about a murder and the people who solve it. Her language is just so beautiful and human. It makes you feel as if you are a part of the story, as if you know the characters intimately. Plus her twists are always amazing and I never see them coming!"
"Rating: 5 Stars

French is back in top form. I loved all of her books except for The Secret Place. I was a bit weary when I first started The Trespasser, soon however, I realized that French was 'back' doing what she does best.
Each of her Dublin Murder Squad have a protagonist who somehow finds a resonance to the crime he or she is investigating, and this time it is Antoinette Conway who is drawn to by what looks like a 'slam-dunk lovers' tiff. French's gives her best through her vivid portrayal of her characters: the dialogue in here is real. And she is also a damn good observer: this novel is full of accurate descriptions paying close attention to the different ways one might act as to appear in a certain way.
French never misses a beat. She keeps readers on their toes, giving us plenty to chew on: one minute we think we have the answers, the next we are back to square one. French is clever like that. She knows how to craft a good mystery.

"This book was SO WORTH THE WAIT!

If you've been following my reviews of The Dublin Murder Squad series, you know that I had never heard of it until the recent release of The Trespasser. I was super excited to dig in and read this book .... until I realized it is #6 in a series. I waffled back and forth on whether or not to just read it or go back and start with book #1. I decided to start from the beginning and I'm so glad I did! I've liked some books over others and it was a process for me to gain appreciation for French's writing style. I went from thinking she was a bit too wordy for my liking to thinking that she is a FRICKIN' GENIUS writer! The journey was so well worth it! I loved The Trespasser! This book encompassed everything I've come to expect from French's books and more! Such rich character development, such great narration (thank you audible), a twisty puzzle to unravel, complex internal struggles for the characters, vivid descriptions, and a not-so-perfect ending! It's all there. I hope there will be more books in the future. I'm sad to move on from The Dublin Murder Squad lads and lasses ........ and THAT, my friends, is a sign of a great book!"
"Narrated by tough-as-nails Detective Antoinette Conway, she and her partner Steve Moran are charged with investigating a seemingly routine murder. Of course, it isn't. In the midst of the investigation, she is navigating a hostile work environment where her all-male colleagues have been playing dirty tricks to force her out. The intertwining stories tighten like a spiral, with the tension broken by surprising laugh out loud observations by Conway. Only to build again. Peppered with Dublin slang, noirish scene setting, and astute state-of-being descriptions, it is a book to get lost in, with pleasure. Some examples:

""The day started off strange. It was still dark when I was leaving my gaff, thick cold fog filling the road, rolling it back to its secretive Victorian self: cars faded to smudges, lit windows and street lamps hanging in the middle of nothing.""

""His shave went wrong this morning; his face is raw and flaky, like he's slowly eroding away.""

And a line I hope to use at the next opportunity a friend is going into fantasyland:
""I wish I could take my holidays inside Steve's head.""


"
"Tana French does not disappoint. This book is a slam dunk. It delivers everything fans have come to expect: really intelligent, complex, original plot lines that constantly tantalize and tease the reader into thinking that maybe you are as smart as the author. Detective Conway is not someone you come to love or admire or even become fond of: she is one hard-boiled, self-destructive, razor sharp lady who cannot get enough pain and punishment. Her dialogue is brilliant, and having been in Dublin recently myself, the sound of the voices and the feel of the air resonated strongly although I doubt that I will ever hear the likes of the language used by the squad, in my lifetime ..... and thankfully so! Even for someone who enjoys salty language, I found it startling. The Irish use of English in the law-enforcement community which is the setting for the book, is both lyrical and terribly ugly, but certainly lends color and form to the novel. The mystery of whodunnit held my attention until the last page. In the end, Tana French's books are not about the nature of the crime and the road to nailing the perpertrator. They are about human frailty. "
"Tana French never disappoints. This may be my 2nd favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books after The Likeness.

Listened to the audiobook narrated by Hilda Fay. Lovely Irish brogue and well read.

Warning for adult content, language.

"Another excellent read by Irish mystery writer Tana French. Again, I listened to the audio book because the reading, by an Irish Actress, adds so much to the enjoyment of French's superb dialogue.
This book returns to the detectives of her last book, Moran and Conway, but this time the narrator and the focal point is Conway. She is being given a hard time by the other detectives, who she feels are trying to run her out of the murder squad. She is prickly and doesn't mix well with the good old boys of the detective squad. She and Moran always get the boring Domestic Violence cases. The story opens as the two detectives are finishing a long night shift and at the last minute, O'Kelly, their gaffer (the head of the Murder Squad) gives them the case of a young woman found dead in her apartment after an anonymous call.
Tana French is a fantastic writer. If you haven't read her books, you need to. This is the 6th of her Dublin Murder Squad books. They don't necessarily have to be read in sequence."
"This was one of my most anticipated books of the year and, as expected, the genius of Tana French did not disappoint. I really loved detective Antoinette Conway - there's something so incredible about French writing a female character, as she wrote Cassie in The Likeness. Of course, all of her characters are fantastic, but I have been particularly drawn to those two out of the six she's written so far. In this book, Conway and her partner, detective Stephen Moran, are assigned to a murder case that seems pretty simple at first - a young woman is found dead from a head injury after it appears that she had a dinner date all set up and ready to go - but it becomes clear right from the start that things are not what they seem with the victim and those around her. As only French can do, she pulls together all of the different threads of this story, mixed in with intricate character development and snappy dialogue, and she had me riveted throughout the entire novel. I absolutely loved it and am ready for the next book in the series."
"It isn't hard to figure out what makes Tana French such a dynamite writer. Her M.O.--featuring a single detective in the Dublin Murder Squad, with personal backstory that that enhances or enlarges the facts of each case-- makes the series unique. You're not covering the same ground on Central Character in each book, although the setting feels familiar. The language and color and values of Dublin are wonderfully rendered, especially to an American reader--you're not in Kansas (or Long Island or Boston) any more. And nobody writes female characters like French.

The plotting is her strongest suit, however. There's so much more than whodunit--there's the why and the how, but also (and this is where so many thrillers fall down) what happens after the solve. She avoids the Climax Shootout, relying on twists and psychological conflict and leaving some things unresolved.

I have loved every one of her books, and this one, I think, is her very best. Five stars plus.
"
"The Trespasser by Tana French is a well written police procedural full of suspense and mystery. Antoinette Conway is a detective in squad full of detectives who would make better enemies than friends, and who are only too willing to sabotage her cases. Her partner Stephen Moran, is supportive of her and they really mesh well as partners.

A young woman, Aislinn Murray, is found murdered in her apartment, not far from where Conway lives. Aislinn's new boyfriend, Rory, is a prime suspect.

Conway suspects that if she doesn't solve this one, she is out of the Murder squad. It's her first big case as lead detective, but, for the most part, she has been razzed--the only female on the Dublin Murder Squad, and she's also forceful and assertive, something that doesn't go over well with some of the other detectives. She feels that this case could set things right for her. Conway's worries about her job is part of the book's suspense."
"I do not say this lightly: Tana French has a gift. Each one of her books has scrubbed my brain raw and wrung it out to dry, leaving it with a new perspective on human nature. This isn't surprising as each book is told from the perspective of a different character, but what's impressive is her chameleonic ability to write so convincingly and authentically in the first person as male, female, coward, daredevil, daydreamer, realist, pessimist, optimist, and mirror the reader's own soul from a new angle each time. The Trespasser is about strength and weakness, and the stories we tell ourselves to conceal our weaknesses and muster the strength for what needs to be done; how these stories are both useful and misleading, and how you can tell yourself a new story tomorrow, either to condemn or congratulate your actions, and you'd still be the same person you are today."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I listened to the audible version and loved the Irish accents although at times I could have used a bit of a translation. D= detective. Vic=victim. Shite is the same for the US hold the last e! This is only my second book by this author. I'll be reading more, for sure.


April 2020: So - I had the hard cover version and I downloaded an audio version from Libby. When I went to add this title to Goodreads, I realized I had already read it, but I was 50 pages in and had absolutely no recollection of ever having read this book. I finished it this morning and nothing, not one thing, rang a bell. I enjoyed it (again), loved the strong, flawed female character, the language and the writing. I found a couple of questionable bits along the plot line - but nothing major.
"
"Tana French gets better with each book. She puts together a tight procedural, with believable dialogue, and a satisfying plot, all while delivering a character study previously only available in Literature (that's Literature with a capital L). In this sixth book, the partners Antoinette and Steve are paired up again, with Antoinette again being the lead detective. But this time the book is told from Antoinette's perspective, where book five was told from Steve's point of view. We find that neither of them is as they report; not exactly unreliable narrators, but the even more difficult to pull off point of view on the facts. I would start with book #1, as the same characters repeat in these books. One last item that makes this series stand out...there is no Moonlighting sexual tension. A man and woman are partners, both are single, and they don't want to shag each other."
"Tana French does it again! Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are investigating what looks like a routine domestic case but turns into one with a lot more complexity. Single woman Aislinn (pronounced Ashlynn on the audio book) Murray is found dead in her flat from a head wound, hitting it on the fireplace brick. What is best about this story is not the plot so much as the way that French gets into Conway's head. We watch a lot of SVU and there are scenes in this book where when in the interview room with witnesses, you learn exactly what the detectives are thinking. Conway as the main character was a bit too ""angry"" for my taste but I eventually warmed up to her. As in most French's novel, the personal story of the main character bears some similarity to the victim.

Couldn't wait to read this and now I am disappointed that I am finished."
"I loved this book and was so pleased, after the slight disappointment of her last one, to find Tana French back to her best. The plot kept me guessing almost to the end - Could it really have been one of the Murder Squad detectives whodunnit? Or did Conway & Moran get it spectacularly wrong & it was actually the other guy after all? And when I was finally convinced as to the guilty party, there was further suspense, was he going to get away with it?? As always, the prose and dialogue are superb and transport my mind to the scene. It possibly added to my enjoyment that I was listening to this one on Audiobook and loved hearing Conway's Dublin patter delivered in a gorgeous Dublin accent. Brilliant stuff!"
"OK, more like 4.5 stars, but I'm tacking on an extra half star just because this feels like a much-anticipated return to form, the best since Faithful Place for sure. When TF is working at full throttle, she's pretty much my fave mystery writer of all time. A few minor quibbles: the writing teeters on the brink of being overwrought at times; I think a sharp-eyed editor could have slashed some of the seemingly dozens of descriptions of things like the air in a room being charged/dead/flat/etc. and a character's breath whooshing/being sucked out/feeling gut-punched/etc., but if you take out too much of that, you begin to de-Frenchify the whole thing. I also thought the prodigal pops motif was a bit on the nose. Still, on the whole, I enjoyed this immensely.

"
"Not sure I need to say any more. I eagerly await every new Tana French release, and this one was no disappointment. The Likeness and The Secret Place are still my top picks, but this was a compelling story that I could not put down. I liked that it featured a character that I have known about for a while. There wasn't as much ""up in the air"" mystery about this story-once things fell into place, it was pretty straightforward. I just realized that The Secret Place featured Det. Moran, so I may have to go read it again to see his story, as he is now Det. Conway's partner. Anyway, that's all in-universe stuff. I love these books and I will continue to read them and await them for as long as Tana French keeps writing them."
"Tana French does it again, with the best novel of the year in my opinion. This book is well written and crafted. Her detail for character development, storyline and suspense, keeps the reader wanting more even after the book has ended. She is a writer that I hope will continue her craft for many years to come. If you haven’t read Tana French I would start immediately!

I will not go into the story-line, many other reviews have already done this so I will just rate the book on its elements (0 to 5 being highest):

Protagonist Development: 5
Antagonist Development: 5
Minor Character Development: 5
Storyline: 5
Setting: 5
Theme: 5
Writing Style: 5
Overall Rating: 5

I do not give many books a Overall Rating of 5 so to me this is a must read!"
"HOW DOES TANA FRENCH PULL IT OFF EVERY TIME!?

I'm serious, she's a master at creating characters and intricate stories.

Are the scenarios on her novels batsh*t crazy? Absolutely.

There's the one with a detective taking the place of her doppleganger, the one with a supernatural element at a girl's school, the one where a detective has to figure out who killed his girlfriend from decades ago. They all sound insane.

And yet... She makes it work.
And you buy it.
And you want more of it.

This one in particular had me hooked since the start because of Detective Conway and it never let me go. The plot! The interrogation scenes! THE ENDING!!!!

I'll stop fangirling now... maybe."
"One of the best books I've read all year. This is part of the Dublin Murder Squad series. Conway and Moran are given the case of a young woman found dead in her home. There's an obvious suspect, but wait a minute. Antoinette Conway is the only woman on the squad and she believes no one likes her. Lots of harrassement. Her partner Steve is the only one who gets along with her and she's suspicious of him. French is an awesome writer and the narrator has the perfect Irish accent. I just loved this book. I listened to it on CD in my car and there were times when I wanted to drive around the block for a few times, so I could finish the chapter."
"Wow. This is much, much better than The Secret Place - Antoinette Conway's narrative voice is so much more distinctive and compelling. This was just so exceptionally written - a kind of poetry I'm not used to when I read crime fic. The plot wasn't SUPER mind-blowing or anything (still surprising!), but this was well worth the read just for the writing, the atmosphere, and the constant tension (as opposed to The Secret Place, there was basically no point where I wanted to put the book down.) Still conflicted about how she writes Antoinette as a mixed-race WoC though - and how her race is addressed/not addressed. It could use some discourse. "
"I love Tana French's books. She's got an incredible ear for dialogue, and her characters are rich and believable. In The Trespasser, the death of a woman during an apparently simple domestic dispute quickly becomes complicated for two members of Dublin's Murder Squad. French brings back Conway and Moran, the main characters from The Secret Place, with Conway playing the central role. She's antagonistic and bitter to an extreme, and while not someone I'd want to hang out with, she made for a great main character. I don't remember being this absorbed by a book in ages, and I didn't know how it was going to end until the book wrapped up. A really great read. Recommended."
"During our recent podcast discussion, Tana French called her new main character Detective Antoinette Conway “a tough cookie.” That was a tremendous understatement. She doesn’t have much choice; she’s constantly under fire from her male counterparts both inside and outside the squad room. Judging by the job she does investigating what seems like an open and shut murder case at first, there’s no one else I’d rather have relentlessly digging for the truth. French is the master of atmosphere, but it’s her character work in The Trespasser that vaults her work into another weight class. This is crime fiction at its finest."
"When I describe Tana French's books and refer to them as crime stories or murder mysteries, I always quickly add that they more literary than that description implies. Because while the story is urging the reader to quickly turn pages, the writing is doing just the opposite, making the reader want to slow down and mull over every word and description.

Whiles I've read and enjoyed all of Tana French's books, this one is my favorite. The twist to the plot and the complexity of the characters kept me thinking about the story well after I turned the final page. I'll recommend this book to every reader I know, and look forward to her next one."
"I've never wanted to watch a serialized TV recreation of a book more than this one. Calling all directors! 🤞 French never falls into the boring cliches of Maverick cops who drink their coffee black and have Black ops level of unbelievable talents. Her characters are as elaborate, realistic, multifaceted and intriguing as the plot line itself. Spoilers below 👇


The partner duo is Antoinette Conway (main) and Steve Curran- the same as The Secret Place.

in the story the newbie detectives take the less desirable night shift. It's less desirable because even though murders happen at night, murders aren't discovered until the morning. So generally they work the manslaughter cases of drunk bar brawls and other cases that they don't love. Antoinette deals with feelings of being bullied because she's the only woman and has had the men there pee in her locker, steal the sign sheets off her witness statements rendering them useless and other tactics to make her feel like she should quit. This is given her a chip the size of Texas on her shoulder that she wears as proud as her Garda badge.

so it was a surprise to them when they're about to clock off for their shift and their captain O'Kelly's brought them a case that he assured them was an open-and-shut domestic violence case that he wanted them to work, instead of doing what he would usually do which is wait for the morning shift to come in a few minutes later and take it over. He further did something odd by insisting that veteran detective Breslin follow them around on the case and make sure that they closed it correctly. This made both of them really annoyed.

The case: Aislinn Murray was dressed to the nines. It was clear she was going to have a romantic dinner at her house, but it was never eaten. She had been punched hard in the side of the head, I fell and landed on the fireplace which split the back of her head and killed her. they quickly track down a best friend who hinted that she may have been having an affair with a dangerous person, and they also tracked down the date in question.

very quickly they start to get pressured by breslin to close the case even before all of the evidence is in. through a series of small hints and suspicions, the detectives start to wonder if their victim was dating a married gangster and furthermore they started to wonder if breslin and his partner McCann were on the take. They chase down this lead for a few days which ends up being futile.

During this time, Antoinette starts to spiral. She is a fairly unlikeable character even though you relate to her, you don't necessarily relate to her in a good way. While it does seem like plenty of the men treat her bad, it also seems like she solicits enemies everywhere she goes by having an overly brisk manner and bad behavior. as she's losing sleep on this case and spiraling thinking that she's going to have to call out her own squad, she starts to assume even her partner is against her and that she's going to need to put in her papers and go work in private security.

The pressure continues to arrest the date of the victim, Rory. And even though he did seem a little obsessed with her, including borderline stalking her house and the days between their dates, it seems like he was more infatuated with an outsized crush rather than being a danger. Finally, they learn that their victim had been to the station before years before. Her father had ran away and she always wanted to know if he was dead or what happened to him. Antoinette, through a series of very complicated twists and turns, is able to find out that McCann was the detective on her father's case, and that he was able to track him down to England and found out he was living there with the younger woman. Instead of telling the family, he kept it to himself. Antoinette never forgave him when she discovered this and she set out to seduce him, now as an adult that he would not recognize, encourage him to leave his family and ruin his life. And then break up with him so that she had control over all of his familial relationships the way that he took control over hers.

Long story short you realize that it's more likely than not that McCann did kill her. Breslin was covering up for him. And they started to assume that their Captain O'Kelly was in on it as well. In the end, they went to O'Kelly and told them the evidence that they had and fully expected him to do a cover-up. But instead he pulled McCann up into the office in front of the two detectives, made him explain to him what happened, and then excuse the two detectives before taking him into booking. He also assured them that breslin would probably lose his job then more than likely be brought up on charges. And that O'Kelly's himself my also find himself in trouble because he trusted breslin and I can't too much and allowed them too much leeway.

Antoinette discovers here that there was only one man on the force that was truly being awful to her, and everyone else more or less didn't care. She realizes that the chip that she had been carrying around cause her more harm than good. And she also realized that she jumped too quickly to the conclusion that people in her own squad would be corrupt, rather than taking the same pride in their job that she took in hers.

Tana French does such a good job of weaving you through the inner turmoil of her characters as long as well as leading you through a twisted path of a plot. But nothing ever become so convoluted and twisted that it's cumbersome or tiresome to read. It all stays in the realm of reality. And that's what makes it so great. Of all the murder squad books, this one is the best."
"Though the main character in this one was definitely not even close to my favorite narrator in the series, I loved this book. I loved how French unfolds her mysteries while deriving parallels with the detectives' lives. Once again, she was able to create a story that kept me as interested in the goings on with the Murder Squad as with the mystery itself....and the way the resolution unfolded in The Trespasser, down to the last few moments of the book could not have been more satisfying and believable.

Can Tana French do no wrong?????"
"Really really superb. So many lies it's hard to imagine anything is true. Brilliant plot twists, incredible strategizing, clever, clever dialogue. And some sad philosophizing about the tedium of middle class life:
""I thought I knew the rest of my life like it had already happened. All the decisions that make a difference, I’d made them before I was twenty-five—the job, the wife, the neighborhood, having kids. All that was left was for me to sit there and watch them play out. No twists left; no surprises.”"
"Love these books.

I think this is the only series of books where I actually anticipate the release of the next one.

This was sooo much better than #5.

These are different from your typical murder mystery or police procedural.

Very enjoyable.

Every book in the series is from the point of view of a different member of the Dublin Murder Squad, or someone close to it. Love the continuity of characters, yet the different versions of the characters we get as we see things from their perspective."
"Agonizingly slow, drawn-details: in the hands of anyone but Tana French, this would be a recipe for disaster!! French has the power to make me hang on every word!! The Trespasser is the sixth in her Dublin Murder Squad series, and I can't get enough. She's draws her characters with such fine brush strokes. And she doesn't need a serial killer or some crazed lunatic to grab my attention. The book starts with a seemingly routine domestic. It's a rather simple story that unfolds, but with all the depth and richness of Ireland and Tana French. "
"I was in a rush to read this for Book Club on the 11th. I so hoped it wasn't awful and happily, it wasn't -- it was great. I love mysteries, and even though the heroine was sort of abrasive and rude, she had her reasons. Fortunately, she had an adorable partner, who was also smart and intuitive. I was a bit worried that the bad guys would not get what they deserved, and it did take 449 pages, but I loved it. OK -- I whine about this with a lot of books, but this one did not really need to go on QUITE so long. 349 pages would have been sufficient. "
"Love! Oh Tana, you did it again. I've been walking around depressed for days that this book is over.

I really enjoyed the close focus on the police squad in this one. A tense police procedural that also looks closely at the bonds of detectives and the meaning of investigating 'one of your own.' As always, French is brilliant at getting inside the skin of her characters and all that haunts them, pisses them off, and drives them forward. She's amazing."
"Tana French has done it again. This may be one of her very best, and that's saying a lot. I cannot think of another writer off the top of my head who so consistently gets the complexity of individuals brushing up against each other so very right. This novel, more than anything, is about the stories we tell ourselves that end up directing our lives down paths where we might rather not go, but how we still can't seem to give up those stories all the same. "
"So good! I love every Tana French Dublin Murder Squad book, and this one did not let me down.

I don't want to give out spoilers, so I'll just say that this book had everything you'd expect if you've read any of the other 5, but it was not at all predictable.

Two great main characters, plenty of twists and turns, and it kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end! And of course, I'm practically depressed now that it's all over...but still thoroughly satisfied."
"I loved it! This was an unusual plot without much happening externally but a great deal internally among the main characters. The protagonist partners who complement each other by being at once opposites and kindred spirits were brilliant in their premier, The Secret Place, as they were again in this novel. There's a richness of speech and personality, lots of suspicions among the various people in the department, and finally a believable, twisted solution."
"I'm new to Tana French and Detective Antoinette Conway but she instantly became one of my all time favorite characters. That says a lot since this is something like #6 in the series. I didn't feel like I missed any character development by starting here. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook narrated by Hilda Fay. Then you can read any of the others and you'll get all the accents, expressions, and humor just right. Definitely one of my favorite books of 2016. "
"
I took this book everywhere so I could finish it in the two weeks I had it out from the library!
I was hooked from the start. This rebel female detective writes a good story and goes deep into all the possibilities of how/why a girl was murdered any by whom. Her love of the job, her drive to get to the truth and her sense of humor makes the story go fast even though there are quite a few twists and complications that all wrap up in the end.
I miss this book!!!"
"I just love her books. All of them, though this one may have been one of my favorites - I'm so glad she picked Antoinette Conway as the lead character for this one (was hoping she would, ever since The Secret Place). Other than Cassie Maddox from The Likeness, I think Conway is the main character I've enjoyed the most - and I especially enjoyed the way French tied Conway's character development to the resolution of the murder in this one. "
"Absolutely LOVED this book, perhaps even more than all the others by Tana French. I was going through a period when I wasn't hooked by any book, and left many half read. But as soon as I heard the narrator, I knew I'd love it, and settled in for a good, long read.

I think I like all Tana's characters. I'm a little disappointed when they don't show up again, but it takes a lot of talent to create such great characters."
"The mysteries of DUBLIN MURDER SQUAD are wonderfully constructed, but most impressive here is French's writing: elegant, atmospheric, even poetic. The characters are actualized and incredibly complicated, and thanks to French's novel approach to protagonists, we see every character from multiple perspectives: as they see themselves, and as other people see them.

"4.5/5. Sólida novela policíaca. No me dejaba respirar, hasta llegar a algún checkpoint en la historia no era capaz de soltar el libro.
Es cierto que rumbo al desenlace, cuando ya puedes ver hacia dónde va la historia, afloja un poco el ritmo, pero aún así te mantiene enganchado hasta el final, deseando saber cómo carajos se va a resolver todo este desastre.
Mi única queja es que el final se siente muy de ""y vivieron felices y comieron perdices"", pero a pesar de ello fue un final redondo"
"These stories never end up quite like you think they're going to, nothing is cut and dried, black and white. Always a little bit of a letdown, but in a good way. Justice is done, but there's nothing to celebrate because of the wrecked lives involved. Nevertheless, a pint never hurts. Excellent author, love the writing."
"Her best yet!

I not only couldn't put it down, I could hardly breathe many times in this really great murder mystery. A very different kind of mystery where you not only wonder whodunit, but what's going to happen when you find out. If you're a fan of Tana French, you won't want to miss it, if not, read this and you'll become one if you like mysteries."
"Tana French is back! My favorite since The Likeness. Not absolutely perfect, I vacillated between 4 and 5 stars, but an interesting and fast moving story with excellent character development. the main flaw I saw was a bit too much convenience with a couple people such as Lucy and Rory. The book was extra enjoyable in audio form, as that Irish accent is just so fun to listen to."
"Tana French is brilliant. I love her flawed characters and driving suspense. I am a little deflated every time I finish one of her books knowing that I'm going to have to wait again for her next book.

* For more sensitive readers there is a bit of swearing, but most of it is in Irish so less offensive?"
"Another thrilling, fast-paced Dublin Murder Squad novel! I finished it in about 2.5 days. Admittedly, the narrator in this one is a little annoying, and the misogynistic undertones are rather cringe-worthy (and make you wonder just how bad the Dublin police really is when it comes to women on the force), but the story holds together well and has a satisfying resolution. "
"The ending wasn't as intense or epic as some of her others, like The Likeness or The Secret Place (my favorites), but I really just adore how well she crafts characters. Steven Moran has got to be one of my favorites of her characters, all-time, and he was just as good in this side role next to Conway. French is a master wordsmith, constantly making me drool over the way she ""turns a phrase."""
"Genius. I have to start giving Tana French 5 stars. Her books are immensely satisfying: well written, complex, intriguing, with credible and sympathetic characters. Also, there's that can't-put-this-down element which I love. How she keeps writing novels at this level, I don't know. But I'm grateful."
Wow! I can't believe I haven't read anything by this author before. I read the NY Times Book Review and thought what a great review. So I read the book. A little slow in the middle but so well written. Great character development. And I was taken by surprise at the ending. Will read more of her books.
"She's back! After loving her first 3 and not loving books 4 and 5, I'm back to a five rating. I love Tana French's character dialogue and how you really get to know or feel her characters - even the minor ones. Her attention to detail is superb. Hoping it doesn't take long for her next installment. "
"I really enjoyed this. I quite liked the slower pace, and I thought the ending was simultaneously captivating and believable. Though I read Tana French as a 'guilty pleasure' (and what a pleasure it is), I find her grip on story/plot inspiring, really. I imagine she really enjoys writing these books - but maybe not as much as I enjoy reading them. ;)"
"Tana French just gets better and better. The voice of her protagonist here, Antoinette Conway, is rough and ready but smart as a whip, and there’s some beautiful writing woven into the prose. I felt I was always on the cusp of guessing who the murderer was, but each time I thought I’d figured it out, there was more to know. Altogether a gripping and satisfying read. "
"Conway's got one of those chess-playing minds that sees everything three or four steps ahead, although in this twisted case it's hard to tell if she's seeing the right three steps ahead or not.
read more..."
"Read via a NetGalley ARC.

Fantastic entry in this series! Possibly my favorite one yet - I honestly didn't see what was coming, and the end was brill. French continues to be one of my favorite authors and one of the few crime writers I read."
French has done it again! A terrific investigation from Conway and Moran on the Murder Squad into a simple domestic that turns out to be so much more interesting! This page turner will keep you guessing from start to finish !
I finished this last week and am just now getting over the fact that there are no more books in the series until Tana French writes a new one. I liked the ending of this book more than I liked the first few books.
"When Tana French is on fire, her writing is like a cobra that slowly coils around you and then, just when you're not suspecting it, incapacitates you with its unrelenting strength. I'm happy to report that she is alight in her newest book. "
"I was soooo sad to see this one end, I definitely didn't want to leave these characters. As always, French didn't disappoint! The tension was intensely present throughout most of the novel and I did not guess the ending; the way the mystery unraveled in the end was incredibly pleasing. "
"So I figured out who the killer was after about a hundred pages, but come on. It's Tana French we're talking about here - there's no way this was going to be anything less than amazingly brilliant, even with the element of surprise slightly squashed."
Tana French is amazing. I loved every second of The Tresspasser in a way I haven't since The Likeness. She is just so damn good at tough but believable women. The case in this one was very well done and just twisty enough to keep me going without becoming outrageous. Fantastic book. 
"Ah this one kept me squirming didn't it just!

No really I had to keep putting it down. Very intense. I highly recommend the Dublin murder squad books to anyone who likes murder mysteries and haven't given them a try."
"Crime/detective books are not my first go to, but when I do read them, Tana French is the best. I wouldn't have figured out the ending. I love how much she gets into the characters heads and how real she makes them for a thriller genre. "
"As usual with Tana French novels, there were scenes I just had to finish to find out what happened. It's unpredictable, clever, descriptive, astute, and the plot kept my interest. When she writes a new novel, I read it."
"As always, Tana French tells a story like no other writer of the mystery genre. I wavered between a 4 & 5 because sometimes the narrators of the ""inner stories "" got a little wordy, but I never lost interest & was still surprised at the end."
"Once again Tana French does not disappoint. What I like best about her books is no two are the same; she is no formula writer and takes the time to develop her characters and let the plot unfold, never forcing the storyline."
This series gets better with every book. I loved it! Even after I'd guessed who dunnit (right around the same time as the detectives) the story kept me hooked right until the end. Can't wait for the next book to come out! 
"On a second read, it was probably even better. Antoinette's (justifiable) paranoia fills every corner of this book and feels a little bit too real to life. I maintain that Tana's books work because her characters are so realistic and consistent, and that's true here too. "
"I visited the library recently with a librarian and she recommended this book. I'd never read any in this series but she assured me I could jump right in.

She was right! I really enjoyed the fast-pace of this book. It's got intrigue, mystery and thrills."
"Tanya French Does It Again!

The Trespasser, another great read , Tana character's so interesting. It's like you are there watching an I guess we are. So far I have read about four of her books enjoyed everyone. It's 11 pm so going to bed."
"My favorite Tana French to date. Characters from skillfully flawed protagonist, members of the murder squad and bit players are artistically developed. Procedural has an element I prize- plausibility. Wonderful read."
"I will literally read anything Tana French writes. ily Tana

(I know it took a lot of hard work to get there, but can we just skip to the part where I'm also a wildly successful writer living abroad in Ireland? can we?)"
I loves this book! I really enjoy the team of Antoinette and Stephen and how well they work together. The case was very interesting and I was in suspense the whole time reading the book. I was happy with the ending and can't wait to read the next in this series.
Another brilliant Tana French novel that just wrecked me.
God damn this was a good one. First female main character since The Likeness and it works very well for the story. 
Maybe my favorite yet. Wow. WOW.
"Oh, Tana French. What a story. What layers. What depth. What tension. WHAT an accomplishment. Exquisitely done. "
I LOVED IT SO MUCH. I'd read a thousand books about the adventures of Conway & Moran: Murder Ds. 
This is pure genious writing. It's a masterpiece.
"After a bit of a slow start, this book was fabulous!! Tana doesn't disappoint. A good few twists and turns that left me guessing. Definitely recommend it to mystery enthusiasts. "
"Right up there with Faithful Place as the ""top reads"" in this series. Excellent."
An atmospheric and psychological story of murder squad detectives not only investigating a murder but exploring our sense of belonging and loyalty and seeking the truth. 
"A perfect novel. As always, Tana French leaves the reader on the edge of their seat to the very last page. Beautifully done, Ms. French.

Beautifully done."
I absolutely love Tana French and the murder squad. This book was such a great story from start to finish. This mystery has me stumped for most of the novel! I could not put his book down! 
Tana French never disappoints. Another winner.
"AMAZING!

edit: Why oh WHY is this the last Dublin Murder Squad book???? **Brings offerings to the book gods in hope of another***"
I need 500 more Tana French books to read right now. I have and will continue to recommend these books to anyone who will listen. 
Tana French weaves a great yarn. I loved this story. Wish she had another I haven't read.....
"Ongoing saga of single girl in all male police force. They are Horrible to her, and she has an attitude that doesn't make it any easier for her. About corruption and cover up in the police force."
"Reminds me why I started reading this series in the first place. Love the detail of these stories, & the development of characters. I love these books.


"
Tana French is absolutely THE BEST. I only wish she cranked 'em out faster! This was definitely one of my favorites of hers. 
I just adore Tana French.
"This is a wonderful entry in the series (or non series, depending on your definition)."
"I think it's perhaps her best so far, looking forward to another."
Another excellent book. Hope to see the next one soon.
"I like all of Tana French's books, but this one was the most awesome."
"Insight into IRISH cops

Suspenseful who dunnit with insight into the detectives minds and lives. Don't try to stop and don't assume anything or think you know how it ends."
Another great read from Tana French. This is one of my favorite series. I hope she keeps going.
"I really liked this one! I've read most (all?) of French's books, and this was one of the better ones. It keeps you guessing, and turning pages. I had a hard time putting it down. "
Best book of the year. This was spectacular. 
Tana French just rips my heart out every single time.
Fantastic read! Story takes you through twists and turns the whole way. Highly recommend. Tana French never disappoints. 
"Super satisfying. The same great psychology as her others, but with a tighter plot and a much more satisfying conclusion. "
"Damn, French does not disappoint."
"Riveting...the perfect unreliable narrator, in that she doesn't even know she's unreliable."
Maybe the only thing about 2016 that didn't suck 
"One of the best books of the year.

This is a book about stories-the ones we tell ourselves, the ones others tell us and how those stories can shift and change in the blink of an eye."
"Maybe her best? And I wanted to immediately reread it. Thank you, Tana French, for writing so well and so intoxicatingly. Here's to fifty more Dublin crime squad novels. A masterpiece. "
Jaysus.
What a fantastic book to read on vacation in Europe. No one does murder mysteries like Tana French.
"We listened to this book in the car while on a road trip, and ""couldn't put it down."" I'm going to go back to the beginning to read her other books...."
I love to read books that are suddused with a sense of place.
"Her best yet. The layered characters, the perspective--I was sucked in and couldn't put it down."
Tana French has no right to be *this good* at writing books. god damn. I need the Dublin Murder Squad series to go on forever I can't believe I'm caught up! 
"Anche quando sospendi la lettura, non puoi fare a meno di stare lì a pensarci. Un ritmo incalzante come pochi, elettrizzante, coinvolgente.
Leggetelo, non ve ne pentirete!
"
Tana French does it again! What a treat reading her books. If you haven't read her start with In The Woods.
Good book. A different kind of mystery & well written. 
Great read.
"Sad this is the last book of the series. Really enjoyed them all, and this final one was my favorite. "
I really want a seventh book at some point from O'Kelly's POV. This one started slow but picks up and becomes one of the series' best. Love the partnership here. Love the story. 
You really can't go wrong with Tana French...
I didn't like the narrator on the audiobook but loved the book when I switched to print.
"“Me and my partner are finishing up another night shift, the kind I used to think. wouldn't exist on the Murder Squad: a massive scoop of boring and a bigger one of stupid, topped off with an avalanche of paperwork. Two scumbags decided to round off their Saturday night out by using another scumbag's head as a dance mat aq L, for reasons that are clear to no one including them; we turned up six witnesses, every one of whom was banjoed drunk, every one of whom told a different story from the other five, and every one of whom wanted us to forget the murder case and investigate why he had been thrown out of the pub/sold bad skunk/ditched by his girlfriend. By the time Witness Number 6 ordered me to find out why the dole had cut him off, I was ready to tell him it was because he was too stupid to legally qualify as a human being and kick all their arses out onto the street, but my partner does patience better than I do, which is one of the main reasons I keep him around. We eventually managed to get four of the witness statements matching not only each other but the evidence, meaning now we can charge one of the scumbags with murder and the other one with assault, which presumably means we've saved the word from evil in some way that I can’t be arsed figuring out.”

“What-if-maybe crap is for weak people. It belongs to the ones who dar are the strength to make actual situations go their way, so they bone to hide away in daydreams where they can play at controlling what comes next. And that makes them even weaker. Every what-if is a gift to anyone who's looking for a hold on you, and that means us. If a guy's whole head is in reality, then reality is the only route we can take to get to him. If he's letting his mind prance off down dozens of twisty hypothetical fairy tales, every one of those is a crack we can use to prize him open.”

“Normally my run leaves me feeling like nothing but long muscles streaming with strength, able and beckoning for more, for anything, bring it on. That feeling is what gets me through my shift. Today the strength is nowhere. I'm lurching like a flabby first-timer; my legs are dragging like they're wrapped in wet sandbags, my arms flop and my breathing can't find a rhythm. I push harder, till my chest feels like it's ripping and thick red seethes up over my eyes. I hang on to a lamppost, doubled over waiting for it to clear.”

“Just for kicks, I experiment with wondering what last night's smug ticker will think when if he sees my name at the heart of the story on every front page. I try it delicately at first, like biting down on a broken tooth you've been avoiding for a long time. It takes me a minute to figure out I'm feeling nothing. I bite harder, wonder whethekr he'll be proud of me for taking down the bad guy, impressed with all the work I put into it, disappointed at what this'll do to my career, disgusted with me for ratting out my own: turns out I don't care. I go meta, try to resent that he left it too late even to let me have a reaction: nothing. All I feel is stupid, for wasting brain space on this shite.”

“All of a sudden it feels like there were so many people nudging Aislinn from every direction: me, Gary, her ma, her da, on and on, all those fingers poking, shoulders barging, everyone shoving her life whatever way happened to suit them. It makes my skin leap like flies are covering it. And finally someone didn't bother nudging: her life didn't suit him, and he punched it right out.”

“Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for a chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.”

"In her sixth Dublin Murder Squad book, Tana French takes a very simple premise for a murder and makes a bounty of it, like the literary equivalent of the loaves and the fishes miracle. Pretty Aishlinn Murray is found dead in her living room, apparently punched so that she cracked her head in falling; she had been preparing for a romantic dinner. The boyfriend, a bookstore owner, is the prime suspect. Someone called the incident in to the police; who? Simple premise, but many branches grow from it, to spring verdant and strangling in Detective Antoinette Conway's head.

Conway and Stephen Moran are assigned the case. Readers were introduced to them in French's previous book, ""The Secret Place."" Moran was the narrator for that one; Conway tells the story here. And it's a twisty one with a low throb of electricity running through it. Conway is beautiful, tough, difficult — and the pariah of the Murder Squad. She's had someone piss in her locker, nick evidence from her, spread rumors. So when she gets pressure from fellow cops to pin the murder on the boyfriend, Rory Fallon, fast, her paranoia kicks into overdrive. But, as the saying goes, just because you're paranoid ...

Conway and Moran are determined not to phone this one in, their small seeds of doubt fed by hints of gang ties, Aishlinn's best mate telling them Ashlinn was having a fling with a mysterious man and hinting that she was in danger, inconsistencies in Fallon's story, and a shadowy figure that seems to be watching — or stalking — Conway.

It all cranks up the wire tension of Conway's paranoia, and French gets us in the detective's head expertly. It's not that we think Conway's going to totally crash to pieces — she's too strong for that — but what will all these forces do to her objectivity, her sense of balance and of self; what happens to us when the flames beneath us get turned too high?

In ""The Trespasser,"" it's as if French's ways of getting in the minds of her first-person narrators, five different ones in the first five books, were thrown in an amped-up blender and what's produced is something more substantial than ever but tasting of all its ingredients. It's ultra-French, more concerned with character than story, but with a good story.

""The Trespasser,"" though 449 pages, is lean and electric even as it lets some interview scenes stretch way out. It's never dull. Many of these scenes could be used in a textbook on how to write dialogue (and how to grill suspects). Crisp, snappy, character-revealing, spot on. And of course, very Irish.

One of French's calling cards seems to be to have her detectives work cases that echo their own lives. That's again the case here, with a brief subplot about Conway and the father she never knew. This minor thread is, frankly, the worst thing in the book. But French has introduced unlikely elements in her books right from the first, ""In the Woods,"" and again in ""The Trespasser"" makes our cringing irrelevant. French is smart and so good I'm willing to follow, and where ""The Trespasser"" leads is pretty awesome.

The book's plot bobs and weaves from one direction to another — what's happening with her colleagues who want to steer Conway? did the rather timid Fallon snap? can Conway even trust her partner? what's Aishlinn's best friend up to? what did Aishlinn's recent personal transformation have to do with her death? — and even if you're not kept guessing (I was) about the killer, hanging out in Conway's head is such a trip I found myself eager for every page.

Yes, it's French's best book (4.5 stars rounded up in part because I hadn't given her 5 yet, and incidentally making it my first five-star rating of a first-time novel read since 2013), and following on the heels of her previous best, ""The Secret Place,"" it bodes well for the future for someone with an already sterling resume."
"When a caterpillar goes into a cocoon and becomes a butterfly - the process is one of nature's most fascinating transformations. I heard a long time ago that if you were to open the cocoon midway through the process all you would find is a kind of green gooey soup.

The thing that put me in mind of that was getting to the halfway point in this well written and enthralling murder mystery. The ugly simple murder problem which seemed to have at least a clarity of structure and threads had descended into a murky soup where neither I nor the protagonist had any idea where it was going. As the story then moved towards its end the soup of confusion reformed into something both clearer and more elegant. So - just like the caterpillar - Conway's case is transformed beyond recognition from that midway murk.

French writes very well. The tensions in Conway's work and life are braided alongside the murder story in a DNA-like double-Helix. This is not just about the victim and what happened to end her life, but about Conway and what she will do with her life. Will bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune? will she rise up and overwhelm them? That is almost as important as who killed Aislinn Murray.

Conway's tale is told in terse first person tense giving Conway an authentic voice. Having read number 6 in the series I feel I must now read some of the others to see how far French adapts the voice to different protagonists.

This is a police procedural story, driven by the cut and thrust of interviews. People under stress trying to talk their way into or out of trouble, while the police wait to pounce desperate fro a confession from people who - if they did but know it - need not confess, indeed need not say anything at all.

The murder mysteries of Agatha Christie and even Sherlock Holmes had such simple ""happy endings"" that is the story was all about uncovering the murderer. But French shows so clearly how knowing who did it is simply not enough. I know you did it, you know I know you did it, but we both know that you will still walk free unless I persuade you to admit some detail.

French injects tension into every interview, the mannerisms and weaknesses of characters so delicately drawn make these the big set-piece confrontations of the book. But between those we still get clear insightful descriptions of place and people as they go about their daily business.

I found one feature of the story particularly resonated, Conway the newcomer transferred into Murder squad from missing persons. In missing persons she was the star turn lauded and appreciated by all enjoying belonging to a team. In murder squad she is the outsider whose competence is always in question. How many pf us have gone through that dislocation of changing jobs and finding the old certainties the acquired capital of knowledge and relationships, hidden foundations of success that we so took for granted are suddenly stripped away leaving us much to build afresh. Conway has doubts whether it is worth the effort - or should she seek an exit to calmer waters. The choice she will make is as much a mystery as the identity of Aislinn Murray's killer.

My final observation, curious as I am to read other examples of French's murder squad books with other lead detectives, I am somewhat unsure how any of the others will come across as sympathetic characters having seen them through Conway's jaded eyes.

"She's done it again. These books are everything: well-written, entertaining, witty, intense... full of deep warmth and true ugliness. It's officially a desert island series for me. The characters are so lovable (or so hateable) and each book offers something truly unique. I've noticed that as the series continues, the scope of each mystery changes... the early ones take place over a longer period of time while the newer ones take place over, what, 2-3 days? She's honed her already impeccable craft... the quality of the storytelling is absolutely maddening and I wish I could shake Tana French's hand for achievement in writing. I'm obsessed.

Antoinette Conway, poor thing, it's your turn. Step right up to the chopping block. That chip on your shoulder was never going to take you someplace good, and anyway, you're just ripe for French's picking with the crunchy attitude and the intelligence and the strong bitchy bones. In this fantastic follow up to The Secret Place, Conway and her partner Moran are assigned what appears to be a cut-and-dry domestic; a young woman has been killed and all signs point to her over-infatuated date. But something's not right, and their investigation leads them through twists and turns toward a destination nobody - including me, a seasoned mystery reader - expected.

I really, really loved this one. I loved In the Woods because it felt so fresh and fully detailed. I loved The Likeness (despite a super questionable premise) because of its characters and references and dark academia vibes. I loved Faithful Place because it felt the most Irish to me, and I adore Frank Mackey, and the whole thing was surprisingly romantic. I loved Broken Harbor because of its themes and clarity and conciseness and because it ended with such a painful gut punch. I thought The Secret Place was okay - frankly, I never want to return to the world of teenage girl, so that one's on me. And here we land at The Trespasser, which I really, really loved because the solution was so shocking and weirdly delightful.

I wish I could explain, without sounding creepy, how real these characters feel to me. There's something about the way French writes both internal monologue and conversational dialogue that just hits so close to real life... her colloquialisms and detective speak and... her grasp of emotions like ambition and fury and resentment and... her characters, I guess, are among the most admirable fuck-ups I've encountered in literature. I should also mention she swatted me right out of a reading slump, so extra points for that.

I realize this ""review"" has been more about myself and my reaction and my feelings about the Dublin Murder Squad series as a whole, but there are plenty of other reviews of this book that say enough about why we love Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran (WE LOVE THEM!). I don't want to dive too deeply into the plot because it's so enjoyable going in blind, and also, if you're here right now, curious about this book, you may already be a French superfan like me and don't need a loud recommendation. Just in case, though: READ THIS! READ THEM ALL! Bask in the glory of these books and let them haunt you forever.

"The Trespasser

Detective Antoinette Conway has a problem: nobody likes her. She’s finally landed her dream job at Dublin’s prestigious homicide division but is soon faced with the Good Ole Boy network closing ranks before her. The only person who does like her is her partner, Stephen Moran. When they are assigned the case of Aislinn Murray, she assumes this is because it’s a shoe-in: the woman was found dead in her home, apparently after a lover’s quarrel gone wrong. But nothing is as it seems, and as Antoinette and Stephen dig deeper, they are met with resistance from all sides.

This is book number six in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I’ve read the rest of the series out of order, and I was quite surprised to find that this book even existed. Glad, too, because I’ve read everything else French has written; finding out there was a book I’d missed out on was a pleasant surprise. I always enjoy French’s books.

There is a caveat to that statement, though.

I do mostly enjoy French’s books, but there is always something about them that I dislike. In The Woods was great, but left me feeling dissatisfied. Cassie, the main character from The Likeness, was a bit of a wet rag. Frank Mackey is just a dick, and not entirely in a way that I think French intended. Broken Harbour was great but so depressing that I almost regret reading it, the ending to The Witch Elm was a dull thud and The Secret Place got lost in its own preponderances.

These are all quibbles, though, because there are very few people who manage to straddle the line between literature and crime fiction as well as French does (Donna Tartt and Laura Lippman do, as well) and I typically enjoy her books a lot, but I think The Trespasser is the first one of hers that didn’t disappoint in any way whatsoever.

As always, it’s the characters that make the novel. Stephen - the focus of the previous book - can be a little angsty, something which does not bother Antoinette one bit, which was a relief. Their relationship is convincing and genuinely fun to read. But unlike many others, French doesn’t skimp on the minor characters, from Breslin - a fellow detective fully convinced of his own hype - to Rory, Aislinn’s wannabe boyfriend. If anyone is good at avoiding cliches, it’s French. And sure, there are things about Antoinette that beg belief, but that doesn’t do away with the fact that she’s an enjoyable person to have at the centre of your novel.

The plot itself is good too and keeps you guessing for a good, long time. The whole gangster angle that the characters pursue is frankly ludicrous, though I’ll cut French some slack there because the characters know that it is. French manages to put the reader on the wrong foot quite a few times, mostly because Antoinette is such a suspicious person, but honestly, until the very end I had no idea where the plot was going to go. Also, Kudos to the author for avoiding the massive outlandish plot twist at the end that so many authors seem to mistake for avoiding predictability.

This book is the last one in the series. It was published in 2016. French has published two standalones since then, and while I enjoyed them I hope she’ll find the time to get back to this series. Because when it comes to crime fiction that has depth, few people can match her work.

"Oh, my beloved Dublin Murder Squad. I tried to savor the experience, spread them out to 1 a year for 6 years, but I still didn't want it to end. Call me crazy, but I think I'm ready to start all over, probably on audio this time (hi, duh, Irish accents!). This book won't land as my favorite in the series, but Tana managed to deliver on the last act in ways I dared not hope for...given certain other conclusions in the series, she cannot be trusted until the bitter end.

Once again, no major thrills here—don't roll up expecting chase scenes and explosive shootouts, this is NOT your book if that's what you need. I'm not sure anyone has even fired a gun in all 6 books. It's about the dialogue, the banter, the anticipation, the ache of tension and disappointment and hope. I'll never know how she does it, but I get a literal burst of adrenaline pumping through my veins while two characters are just talking on a park bench or teeing up an interrogation. This author is so stellar at writing detective work in a way that seems very straightforward and honest (and like actual tedious work, not a neatly solved episode of television), but then our main characters start to describe that sniff of blood in the air as they close in on the truth and I feel like I've swallowed a gallon of caffeine. No one writes a smart and compelling slow burn like this woman.

As always, the language and imagery are top tier. You're living and breathing that Dublin air, immersed in the slang, right there with Antoinette Conway in the pubs and laneways and courtyards. More than ever before, Tana really centers this last installment on the Murder Squad itself, diving into Conway's disillusionment of making it into this elite league of hotshot detectives only to find out that some mixture of sexism, racism, and schoolyard bullying will have her looking over her shoulder in paranoia every step of the way. I'll say more about my opinion of the ending below, but focusing on the grimmer realities of the squad's true nature made so much sense as a closing chapter for the series. If it had to end, ending here makes so much narrative sense.

*Slightly spoilery from here on....you've been warned:

Conway & Moran are going down in history for me, not necessarily as favorites or most memorable leads, but as the most SATISFYING. I couldn't believe it, to be honest. I was holding my breath and crossing my fingers, because babygirl Antoinette (who would shoot me on sight for calling her that) was really going to battle with those internal demons, but for once WE DID IT—we have the golden pair who've survived the war against their flaws and came out triumphant!!!!!! I re-read the last few pages 3 or 4 times out of sheer relief. I'M SO HAPPY FOR THEM. All this time I've wondered what made Tana move on from the series and start writing standalones, but I get it now. This conclusion feels like a healing salve over the ruinous havoc of the past; a power partnership has withstood the ultimate test, the dream of belonging to Murder is resuscitated by book's end, and the darkest shadowy corners of what maybe has been rotten all along in the squad is sussed out and redeemed. And let me tell you, I did NOT have faith that it would go the right way. O'Kelly, you sly dog, you—the man had me sweating in the end! PHEW."
"Bei Tana Frenchs „Gefrorener Schrei“ handelt es sich um den sechsten Band ihrer Reihe rund um das Dubliner Morddezernat, Dublin-Murder-Squad. Das Buch ist im Dezember 2016 bei Fischer Scherz erschienen und umfasst 653 Seiten.
Am Ende ihrer Nachtschicht erhält das Ermittlerpaar Antoinette Conway und Stephen Moran einen neuen Fall, der ihnen von ihrem Chef, O’Kelly, höchstpersönlich zugeteilt wird: Die junge, hübsche Aislinn Murray wurde tot in ihrem Haus aufgefunden, der Tisch für ein romantisches Dinner gedeckt. Was anfangs wie eine einfache Beziehungstat anmutet, entpuppt sich nach und nach als vielschichtiger und komplizierter. Was erschwerend hinzukommt: Antoinette hat das Gefühl, als wolle jemand ihre Ermittlungsarbeiten torpedieren. Wem kann sie noch trauen?
Der Roman ist, trotz einiger langatmiger Stellen gerade zu Beginn, von Anfang bis Ende spannend zu lesen. Der Plot ist vielschichtig und hintergründig konstruiert; auch wenn ich ziemlich rasch ahnte, worauf der Fall und seine Lösung hinauslaufen werden, war es äußerst interessant, die Zusammenhänge am Ende zu ergründen und mitzuverfolgen.
Das Buch ist durchzogen von aktuellen Themen wie Mobbing (am Arbeitsplatz), Glaubhaftigkeit der Polizei, Kritik an den Medien und Stalking.
Gerade der erste Punkt regt sehr zum Nachdenken an. Die Protagonistin selbst sieht sich im Laufe der Ermittlungen mit ihrer eigenen Vergangenheit konfrontiert, von Feinden umgeben, sich selbst über weite Strecken als Opfer und traut nicht einmal ihrem Partner mehr. Dass am Ende, ohne dass alles „Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen“ ist, diese Ansichten zum Teil ins rechte Licht gerückt werden, verleiht der Handlung Authentizität. Es ist doch nicht alles so, wie es auf den ersten Blick scheint, die Welt ist eben schwer zu durchschauen. Dieses besagt auch die Auflösung des Falls: Manchmal ist es einfach nötig, den einengenden Tunnelblick zu verlassen und sich auf neue Perspektiven sowie Möglichkeiten einzulassen.
Dass French ihr Handwerk auch sprachlich beherrscht, zeigt das breite Spektrum ihres Stils. Die Ich-Perspektive im Präsens erleichtert die Identifikation mit Antoinette, man hat während des Lesens fast das Gefühl, als plaudere sie mit den Leser*innen und die Sprache ist daher eher umgangssprachlich, an einigen Stellen fast schon vulgär, sprich authentisch. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es, wenn die Autorin z.B. das Dezernat ausmalt, Stellen poetischer Beschreibungen: „Der Soko-Raum wirkt unsicher und bedroht, ein Schiff auf unruhiger See …“. Liest man wiederum die Vernehmungen durch die Kommissarin und ihren Kollegen, Breslin, hat man das Gefühl, live dabei zu sein, muss an einigen Stellen sogar schmunzeln.
Tana French präsentiert mit „Gefrorener Schrei“ einen spannenden, vielschichtigen und psychologisch interessanten Roman, der Leserinnen und Leser in seinen Bann zieht. Gepaart mit der sprachlichen Leistung ist es ein Buch, an dem alle Liebhaber*innen spannungsgeladener Literatur ihre wahre Freude haben werden. Von mir gibt es eine uneingeschränkte Leseempfehlung.

"Detective Antoinette Conway and her Detective Stephen Moran haven’t been partners for long but they seem to fit together perfectly. In this police-procedural crime fiction, even as opposite personalities, they shine together as the newbie and bullied detectives, and their success is outstanding at the end.

In the prologue of the story the reader is introduced to the kind of a woman who is traumatized throughout her life by the disappearance of her father. This setup points both to the victim and Detective Conway. Yet the same incident has affected the two women differently.

Detective Conway is brash, volatile, tough, and seemingly independent. Her tough exterior is because she is the only woman detective who has been subjected to hazing by almost every other detective on the murder squad. She is alert to what happens around her and is affected and even swayed by those things even if she doesn’t show it outwardly. The present case is about charging one of her colleagues with murder, and in doing that, she may eventually mellow down a bit.

The victim Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home with a head wound. This has happened just when she was about to entertain her new boyfriend Rory Fallon, who is the obvious suspect. Rory is weak and scared and he keeps changing his story. His explanation of his timeline in the evening of the murder is not clear either. Still, from the way he talks, Conway and Moran suspect that Rory is innocent of the crime.

Aislinn’s death isn’t really murder but probably manslaughter as it was caused by her old boyfriend, a married detective, with whom she had started dating with the sole purpose of finding her long-lost father. When she met Rory, she really liked him and would probably shoo away the detective.

The solving of this crime takes many twists and turns, as so many people have so many motives, and at each step, the reader gets to know the people in the story better. Among those people is Breslin, the seasoned detective who is out to protect his partner from prosecution as he tries to take away the case or change the course of the investigation by pressuring Conway and Moran to charge Rory. Another one is Lucy, Aislinn’s best friend, whose testimony helps solve the crime.

The story is told from the first-person point of view by Conway, who is sometimes unreliable in her way of looking at things.

Tana French’s deep insight into her characters is amazing, and yet, she succeeds to crown this insight with her perfectly constructed plots. This may be why her books are a bit longer than most other crime fiction, but so much more worth the reading.

Those who are used to cut-and-dry police-procedural stories and are interested only on the action and plot may find Tana French's murder stories a bit tedious and long, but I find them to be much more than murder stories, as this author makes me appreciate once again the art of all Irish poets and writers since Joyce.

"
"Tana French is one of, if not, the best mystery/thriller writers active today. Her stories are tightly written and fast-paced. She finds a way to draw you into the story with each word and creates tension in an organic fashion. You don't realize that you are completely immersed in the story until it's too late.

The Trespasser is no exception. It centers on Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran. We met them in a past installment but this is the first time they've taken the main stage. Antoinette is having problems in the murder squad. As the only woman, she is being harassed by co-workers and encounters enemies at every turn. Seemingly, Steve is her only ally. They are assigned the crap cases; mostly domestics and other low profile killings. While their solve rate is high, the partners receive very little respect among the other detectives. When they are assigned a case that appears open and shut - girlfriend killed by boyfriend - things are not as they seem.

The plot in The Trespasser is close to perfect. French would have a 5-star book if that was all she was able to portray. A mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In fact, I had to take a break for a few days about halfway through. It was stressing me out a little and at that time I just couldn't quite deal with it. Yes, books affect me emotionally and spiritually. And I love it.

Any of you that have read French's work in the past know that she isn't content with only writing a fabulous mystery. She has to do...more. And, in The Trespasser, the 'more' is the sub-plot focusing on a woman working in a traditionally male environment. Antionette is smart and good at her job. In her past work in the Missing Persons unit, she was an up and coming detective. She got on well with her fellow detectives and had a good career going. Something changed when she moved to Murder. She would return to her desk to find missing witness statements. Opening her locker, she found that someone had urinated all over her belongings. Things start to get worse as a journalist starts showing up at her scenes and writing about her in a negative light. When she walks into the squad room, she sees nothing but sneers and snickering around her. She has reached her boiling point by the time they are assigned the murder of Aislinn Murray.

In a past life (many moons ago), I worked my way up the corporate ladder. As a woman, I faced different obstacles than my male counterparts. At one point I was managing a small department. I was ready to move on to a different department in the company that would afford more opportunities for advancement. Before I could transfer, my supervisor hired my replacement from outside and asked me to spend a week training him. The first day, I saw that it was going to be a challenge for him to do the job. He had almost no computer skills and it was imperative that he learn. I remember sitting at the desk and asking him to use the mouse to move to a different screen. He looked at me with a blank stare. I said, ""Put your hand on the mouse and move the curser until you can click this button."" Again, I received a blank stare. I said, ""Put your hand on the mouse."" Exceedingly uncomfortable, I had to put my hand over his and show him how to move the mouse and how to click the button. We struggled through his training for the next several days and I was just counting the hours until the end of the week. I knew that the following Monday I would be on a new adventure. On Thursday, I was allowing him to try to do a few things on his own and I was wrapping up some work at my desk. I went to the printer to pick up something and on top was a printout. Many of us shared a common printer, so I scanned the document so that I could deliver it to the right person (we all did this as a courtesy). What I found stopped me in my tracks. It was my replacement's job offer letter showing his salary. Before I realized, I was able to see that he was making significantly (and I mean significantly) more in salary than me. With a shaking hand, I replaced it on the printer and walked into the restroom to calm down. I kept my mouth shut that day and went home to think. At the end of the day, I decided to let sleeping dogs lie. I said nothing and just went on to my new job the following Monday. And, guess what? Over the next several years I moved my way quickly up the corporate ladder and I ended up making a lot of money. I was very fairly compensated. Did I ever forget? No (as you can see by the detail I've remembered above). But, I didn't let it make me bitter and I decided that my work should speak for itself. And it did. But, in all truthfulness, there is still a small part of me that gets angry when I think about this story. Tana French brought out this memory. (If any of you are wondering, this gentleman lasted less than a month in the job after I left. It would be too easy to say ""Neener neener"". Oh heck, who cares - NEENER NEENER!!!)

Antoinette's issue isn't compensation; it's a hostile work environment. She tried to ignore the jibes and 'slagging'. Unfortunately, this is a no win scenario. If you ignore, you are considered weak and unable to deal. If you respond in kind, you are a ""bitch"" and don't get along well with others. When Antionette rightfully puts a co-worker in his place, she is branded as toxic and this begins her downward spiral in the Murder Squad.

Or...maybe not. ***spoilers coming - not on the main plot but on Antoinette's situation***

Men, you might not have dealt with anything similar so may not be able to sympathize with what I'm about to say. Women, most of you will be nodding your head and saying ""yes"" to everything.

Antoinette is angry. She's had to deal with too much and distrusts everyone around her. She even starts to question the gaffer (her boss), Steve (her partner) and a friend she calls for help from Missing Persons. The treatment she's receives has made her paranoid. She starts creating scenarios in her head where everyone is out to get her and she might as well just give up her job.

I have done this so many times. When something isn't going well or I'm dealing with a situation, I will have pre-conversations in my head. I've played out the entire scene before it even happens. By the time I get to the real interaction, I am primed for it to go a certain way. If it does go negatively (as I've played out), was it inevitable or did my attitude lead it in that direction?

What if Antoinette finds out that her real problems and harassment in the murder squad are sourced to only one person? (Yes, he has bad-mouthed her and created false stories that have made the others wary but they aren't after her themselves.). And, what if the gaffer gives her the domestics because he knows she will work them hard and treat the victims with the respect that they deserve? What if he's actually supporting her in trying to keep her solve rate high so she can gain the respect of her coworkers?

As a woman, this is what we deal with almost every day. It's easy to be untrusting and angry. I try to choose to give people the benefit of the doubt when I can and to also choose my battles appropriately. I don't always succeed but I try.

Antoinette learns that she does have allies and those that want her to succeed. Her anger was blinding her to the truth. And, once she got to that truth, it allowed her to change herself and, hopefully, the course of her life.

5/5 stars.

P.S. There is also a sub-plot about the thin blue line. I could spend days writing about this as well but I'm sure others will have focused on this. Another stellar addition to the story."
"5 stars from me!

Wow! What an incredible book. 

During a recent trip to Dublin I perused the shelves of the delightful (and award winning) The Gutter Bookshop and The Trespasser was highly recommended. Having now finished it, I can see why!

Now, for a girl like me who is a fan of the fast paced Simon Kernick esque style of writing, I have to confess that the slower pace of Tana French was a bit of a shock to the system. Please don't mistake 'slower pace' for 'slow' because it isn't, it is just told in a more indulgent style - each scene is delivered to you in glorious technicolour, none of the words seem superfluous and at no point was I bored. If anything, this steadier than usual pace made the book feel luxurious as though the author had taken extra time and care to ensure the resulting story was just right.

The Trespasser has a real feel to it, the characters and their personal and working habits all ring true - within these pages are solid, well-defined individuals who live and breath in their own right. The awkwardness, trust, deceit and burgeoning friendships all feel right and segments throughout this book are exceptionally well observed.

The story itself is doled out in manageable pieces, making your brain work as you get swept along and I am delighted to say that it didn't have a disappointing ending.

I haven't read any of Tana French's other books but I will be making a point of adding them to my, ever growing, 'to be read' pile.

Synopsis: In The Trespasser being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she's there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she's getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers' quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There's nothing unusual about her - except that Antoinette's seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won't stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn's boyfriend, fast. There's a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can't tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"
"Each book I read by Tana French makes me like her as an author more and more. This is another book pertaining to the Dublin Murder Squad. Once again it features Detective Steve Moran and his partner, Detective Antoinette Conway. This time the story unfolds from Conway as she experiences this case.

Conway and Moran are on nightshift getting ready to leave one Sunday morning when they catch a case. The bossman makes Conway lead on a murder of a pretty young girl murdered in her flat the previous night. To help Conway and Moran out, Breslin, a seasoned detective, is also on the case. Breslin swears it is a cut and dried case. The boyfriend did it. Conway knows that it looks that way, but she also knows that except for Moran the rest of the Murder Squad cannot stand her and would love to see her mess up. Something is not right and Breslin is acting like it is open and shut. He also is acting like he is a crooked cop one minute and your older brother who wants to help you the next. Something is so not right with the way this case is going. Moran has Conwayy thinking it's gangsters and Breslin is still pushing Conway o charge the boyfriend. All she knows is the the members of the Murder Squad are making her work life difficult--the page of a witness statement that shows the signature of the witness goes missing, someone pissed in her locker and she randomly gets pulled over thanks too someone calling and reporting she is driving erratic. Paranoia is starting overtake her life. Someone is stalking her flat, it seems obvious that Moran is ready to turn on his partner and the whole squad is trying to get her to mess up the case so bad that she will end up not only out of the Murder Squad but off the Police Force. Antoinette is going to finish this case up and get out of the job. She wants to go while it is her choice not someone else's. Problem is she needs to catch a killer and when the truth starts to emerge, Conway knows she has trouble and this case is not going to end well at all.

Tana French has some flawed characters. In fact, during every story I have read, there is a point where I dislike the main character. They are stupid, annoying, clueless . . You get the idea. That is one of the things that makes her books so good. These characters are human. Sometimes they get caught up in their emotions and feelings. They seem real and you really enjoy them. The characters are great but the story is even better. There are little twists and turns. Even when you see the end coming, it is always better than you imagined. I am going to read her again and again. I suggest you give her a read also."
"Oh my goodness! This was my first Tana French book. Usually it takes me at least a few chapters to get hooked onto a book but this one grabbed me right away. The prose is stunningly beautiful which is something you don’t find very often when reading a thriller. It builds the atmosphere until you’re completely sucked into the book.

A woman is murdered and Detectives Antoinette and Steve turn up to investigate. It starts as a pretty classic mystery plot but then it becomes so much more. Now I don’t want to give off more details about the plot because trust me, the less you know, the more you’ll enjoy the book.

I’m still not sure if I liked Antoinette. She had a pretty rough childhood which is why she’s very skeptical about life. She judges people harshly, any sort of love, kindness is a weakness to her. All in all she got pretty annoying at times. I know that I hated her at moments. I just don’t think a bad past gives you an excuse for treating people like garbage. Especially if you’re an adult. I know that childhood scars are difficult to erase but it’s not impossible. I mean most of the time I couldn’t even see her trying to become a better person. However, she does get a little better by the end and as much as I disliked her, I found her incredibly interesting and somehow I found myself rooting for her.

One of the most important parts of the book is the way Antoinette is treated in the workplace. I love that French acknowledged the difficulties women face in workplaces nowadays. It’s rare to find books that can portray those obstacles decently. The way Antoinette never let it push her down was one of the few moments when I respected and admired her.

Steve was a pretty stand up guy. He is the complete opposite of Antoinette. Which is why they’re partnership was awesome. They’re so different and yet they worked so well together. The way Antoinette learns to trust him, the he brings out her brighter side. It was just such a great dynamic. It was kind of adorable.

Lastly I don’t wanna spoil much but I’ll just say I never expected to like Aislinn that much. She was the victim so it’s a wonder that French added so much depth to her character.

The ending blew my mind. Every time I thought I knew where the story was headed, I was proven wrong. It kept me on my toes. It’s been a while since I’ve stayed up late just because I couldn’t put a book down.

For sensitive readers: the language was quite inappropriate. It made me uncomfortable so if that bothers you then maybe skip this one because there really was quite a lot of it."
"Tana French is the reason I read books. Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, but she is by far my favorite living fiction author. Please read her. Please! And please let me know what you think of her books (so that I can determine how/if our relationship can continue!).
This, the sixth installment in her brilliant Dublin Murder Squad series, has everything I've come to love and appreciate from Tana French: beautifully-wrought prose, a protagonist at turns delightful and despicable, a case that challenges everything endemic to the core of the narrator's personality and by the end of the book makes her question who she even is anymore, and a resolution so satisfying that you realize somewhere in the book you came to care more about the narrator's character arc more than the whodunit (though that part never bores, of course!).
If you'd like a review of this book and French's fiction as a whole--written by someone way better with the word movings than I--read Laura Miller's excellent review in The New Yorker entitled ""Tana French's Intimate Crime Fiction."" It is one of the best literary reviews I've read in years, and Miller deftly puts into words many of the near-ineffable qualities of French's brilliance. Really: read that review, then pick up ANY book in this series.
They can truly be read in any order...you won't be missing anything pertinent if you read in something other than publication order, only some minor references that will make ""in-order readers"" smile a bit. There was an interesting article on Book Riot written by Jessica Woodbury that encouraged reading them in this order:
- Broken Harbor (#4)
- Faithful Place (#3)
- The Secret Place (#5)
- The Trespasser (#6)
- In the Woods (#1)
- The Likeness (#2)
As a huge Tana French fan, I can get behind this order as well, for many reasons. So if the prospect of starting at the beginning of a so-far-6 book series is daunting for you (no judgment!), I'd recommend starting either with The Trespasser or Broken Harbor. Really, though, you can't go wrong. They are all magnificent. MAYBE The Likeness would be the least-best place to start, but even there, with an open mind, you can catch the fever.
I could talk about this author all day long so I'll bail out now, with a quick BEG for you to ask me any questions at all about Tana French or just to chat with me about her if you are already a fan. Seriously...all day."
"Tour de force is too mild. Masterfully written might work. A rare gem is overused, but applicable. French does character studies that would do a character writer, like, say, Maeve Binchy proud. Except French's characters are full of tension and drama that draws you onward, onward, toward the culmination of their case. Each book I've read has been delightful and thrilling on its own. At least, so far, as I've only read 4 of the series. What makes French so special are her character development, and the styling of the mystery. Her characters are deep, complex, and presented from different viewpoints. Her plot lines are believable. Her use of place as an added element is impeccable.
Most police procedurals, or mysteries, spend little time on character. Often the characters are done in what amounts to literary broad brush strokes, giving us cartoon highlights that we can fill with our own images, or apply a stereotype to. I think of Patterson's Alex Cross, or Evanovich's alphabet series here. Fun, enough character to keep the action going, not much more. And the plot lines go right along with that style. They are ""cowboy movies"" of books. Lots of drama and thrilling action, but light on reality.
Each of French's books has recurring characters, but also stars a protagonist who was a background character in another book. In this way, you get to see character development from one character's viewpoint in one book, and then from a different character's voice in a different book.
For instance, in Broken Harbor, we hear from the mouth of Mike ""Scorcher"" Kennedy. In Faithful Place, our protagonist is Frank Mackey, with Scorcher as a backup character. Mackey tells us his views of Scorcher. Mackey shows up again, as a backup character, in ""The Secret Place"". I'm going to go back and re-read ""The Trespasser"", as I read it first, and I would have missed some of that character byplay.
French gives us an intensely interesting read. I've not found them put-down-able, but only up to about halfway through, or a bit more. Her endings have had me staying up late nights to finish them. And frankly, I appreciate that the tension is not so intense throughout. It's like eating an ice cream cone - better to lick than take big bites."
"What an unexpected gem! THE TRESPASSER, by Tana French, her sixth installment of her Dublin Murder Squad stories, is more than just a captivating detective novel. THE TRESPASSER goes deep into the head and heart of its protagonist Detective Antoinette Conway, a young biracial female on the otherwise all-male murder squad. French's series takes on one case at a time, each told from a different detective's point of view. In each of these books, you learn about the inner life of the lead detective. Great idea, that. I haven't read them all, but so far, this is my favorite.

The particular case of this detective story is of a young ""Barbie doll"" who is murdered, allegedly by her new boyfriend, a cookie cutter domestic violence case, at first glance. Except, of course, it might not be, and therein lies the story. The thrilling brilliance of this novel is in the first person mentality of being an outsider. Antoinette is suspicious of everyone of her coworkers, including her choirboy partner, Steve. After years of being bullied, specifically for being female, she doesn't trust any of them. I was as captivated by the subplot about which, if any, of her coworkers was indeed out to get her and trying to force her off the squad. Would this case be her last?

THE TRESPASSER is gritty and crude at times, what we have come to expect from detective novels, I think, but it has more to offer than just a good read. The victim and the detective, both women, share a common factor, one that ends in death for one and a hotshot career for the other. It could lead to an interesting discussion on how girls are raised. The other plus for this book might be mainly for writers, but I was really impressed by how French mastered the skill of a first person narrator. I highly recommend this to anyone who writes or wants to write from the first person POV.

I hesitate to give a contemporary mystery five stars, but ultimately my ratings are about readability. This novel is unputdownable. The writing is clean, the story is fresh, and the outcome is satisfying. I believe Tana French is the new Agatha Christie.

FIVE intense STARS"
"This is an excellent police procedural and, to my mind, Tana French's best book yet. At its center is Detective Antoinette Conway who is new to the Dublin Murder Squad and who has gotten a very cool reception. Many of her new mates actively dislike her; she's subjected to continued harassment, and she's assigned a lot of crap cases.

The pattern seems to be continuing one morning when she and her partner, Stephen Moran, are assigned a new case that appears to be open and shut. An attractive young woman named Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home, apparently the victim of a lovers' quarrel that has spun out of control. The two detectives bring in Aislinn's new boyfriend, Rory Fallon, and question him under the watchful eye of a senior detective who's inserted himself into the case. Fallon is obviously nervous, and there are problems with the story he tells. To the senior detective, the case seems a slam dunk and he presses Conway and Moran to charge Fallon and move on to new business.

Conway, who is the lead detective on the case, balks and insists on clearing up loose ends. As she does, she further alienates many other members of the squad and seems to be committing career suicide. But she and Moran persist and gradually become convinced that maybe this case isn't as simple and straightforward as it appears on the surface.

Like all of French's characters, Antoinette Conway is a complex bundle of ambition, hopes, fears, dreams and doubts. She carries a lot of personal baggage, and at times, she's not very likeable. But she is smart and persistent and determined to follow her own course, irrespective of where it might lead, who it might offend, and what it might portend for her personally.

The principal strength of the book for me is the way French, through her protagonist, follows this case from beginning to end. The Author has clearly done her homework, and the police procedure here, most especially the scenes in the interview rooms, rings truer than that in almost any other crime novel I've ever read. The book is very well-plotted; the characters and the action are compelling, and it's a book that's almost impossible to put down."
"When I first discovered Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, I read a number of online reviews and articles that recommended skipping the first two works and beginning with her third entry (""Faithful Place"") - then going back and reading the first two. And now that I've finished the the rest of the entries, I understand why people recommend that. (The first two simply are the weakest of the series.)

I still think ""Faithful Place"" (#3) is my favorite in the series, although #5 (""The Secret Place"") and this one are right up there. This entry was a little bit different than her previous books in terms of its protagonists. In her other Dublin Murder Squad novels, Ms. French took a minor character from a previous novel and made them the protagonist. But this novel's protagonists are the same as in ""The Secret Place"": Detective Stephen Moran and Detective Antoinette Conway. The only difference is that Conway is the narrator in this novel.

As always, I won't go into plot details to avoid spoilers, but I will say the murder that forms the foundation of this novel quickly escalates from a typical domestic violence quarrel gone bad to a complex trail of intrigue and revenge that goes back decades. And solving it might just cost Moran and Conway their futures in the Dublin Murder Squad.

That would be a shame because the duo has formed a solid partnership that makes the novel enjoyable. Also, this novel once again captures the land, people, and culture of Ireland in a way that makes me want to go there as soon as I can. The dialogue is typically brilliant...or should I say ""It's grand."" So ""fair play to you,"" Ms. French.

Okay, I'll wrap up this review before I write anything else that would make me sound like a ""fecking eejit"" or ""gobshite."" I'll simply say that Ms. French continues to rise in the ranks of my favorite authors. Unfortunately, this is the last of the published works in the series. So as was the case when I finished Vicki Delany's ""A Curious Incident,"" I'm now forced to wait for the next entry in a much-loved series to be published. Sigh...
"
"There are mild spoilers ahead for The Secret Place. Making Murder Squad isn’t like Conway thought it would be, and the only detective not hell bent on making her life miserable is her partner, Moran. Their new case looks like a neat and tidy lovers’ quarrel, but something about Aislinn Murray’s death refuses to stay tidy. Conway is sure she’s seen her somewhere before, the gaffer has an unusual interest in their progress, and other detectives are pressuring them to arrest the boyfriend quick. Are they still trying to find a way to force her off the squad, or is something more sinister at work? Trigger warnings: death, parent death, abandonment, guns, stalking, harassment, gaslighting.

I put this off because I loved the Dublin Murder Squad series so much that I didn’t want it to be over, but now that I’ve read it, I can see why French ended it here. It’s an exquisite end to a much-loved series, and it’s good to leave it on a high note. I already knew I was going to like being in Conway’s perspective after meeting her in The Secret Place, and this doesn’t disappoint. She’s tough and no-nonsense, but like all of French’s characters, she’s not without her flaws. I adore her partnership with Moran and the way that, despite being total opposites in personality, they work together and know each other so well.

There are so many strengths to this series, and this novel plays to them all. French’s writing is gorgeous and evocative, and the characters are breathtakingly well-drawn. There’s an excellent theme running through this book about the stories we tell ourselves and how dangerous they can be when they don’t match up with reality. The murders are often quite simple, and I like that they’re kept within the realm of possibility. By the end, the gut-punch isn’t in some nonsensical plot twist but in the devastating inevitability. The characters being who and what they are, it could only have gone one way, and it’s all the more tragic and awful for that. It’s peak crime fiction, and while I’m sorry to reach the end, I know I’ll revisit all of these when I start to miss them.

I review regularly at brightbeautifulthings.tumblr.com."

Detective Antoinette Conway is wary of what-ifs. The protagonist of Tana French’s sixth novel in the Dublin Murder Squad mystery series prefers hard evidence to fantasies and fairy tales. She has an obsession with truth and an interest in storytelling’s power dynamics.
Conway and her partner Moran are the newest partnership on the murder squad, and as such, they can expect to see every “boy-beats-girl” domestic case that gets called in. The pair works well together: Moran is able to counterbalance Conway’s directness with gentleness and Conway supplies toughness where Moran is light.51letj945yl

The case should be a “slam dunk” for their solve rate, but when the suspected book clerk boyfriend is interviewed, he comes across as soft. Conway and Moran are left with a lot of conjecture. As the only (self-described) “brownish” woman on the Dublin murder squad, Conway treats her solve rate as a matter of professional pride. It’s her proof she’s in the right profession, and even if she’s considering leaving the squad, she’s not leaving without an airtight conviction in her last case.

The mystery series switches narrators from book to book, each character impressively physiologically detailed, and each book a pivotal moment in the narrator’s perceptions. In addition to struggling with who gets to own a story, Conway is subject to subtle harassment from her colleagues at work: her evidence goes missing, disparaging rumors shadow her, and her contact at the local phone company won’t talk to her anymore. She suspects the squad is applying pressure to force her out.

It’s hard to put The Trespasser down. As solving the case consumes Conway, the book absorbs the reader. The murder victim has a penchant for storytelling, and Conway suspects the culprit killed to keep his place as a hero in the storyline. Tana French’s latest mystery follows an enjoyably self-reliant detective’s quest to convict a murderer"
"Tana French is by far one of the best writers that I have had the pleasure of reading. This is the first book that I have written a review for, and the first for Tana French, so I will say that she has a style of writing that I haven't read before. It is a great mix of great, tense detail, amazing moments of tension and is broken by an interesting mix of humor. But that is only how I feel about Mrs. French's writing as a whole, and this book is an excellent example of how she writes. The book is told through the perspective of Detective Antoinette Conway, who is working a seemingly simple case with her partner Stephan Moran. Quickly the case becomes far more complicated than what it appears, and soon Conway is spinning in circles, wondering which way is the correct way to go.

This book has already been out for a while, but having finished it, I wanted to express how much this book shows how Tana French is able to turn seemingly boring murder cases into a much better journey than many of the tv shows and other stories out there. I will say that it is much easier to get into this book if you have read other Tana French novels. For me, the beginning of the book starts off slow, and fills the reader in on everything that the description of the book tells. Her other books seemed to take off right from the start and never let up. However, towards the middle of the book everything starts to come together. The pace of the book picks up, and, just like Conway's driving, never slows down.

I found that the book is a great addition to the books that Tana French has already written, and is a great crime thriller in general. Because I am a huge fan of Tana French, I thought the book was phenomenal, but readers who are new to Tana French may want to start with one of her earlier novels.

However, I can't know for sure. All I can say is that The Trespasser is another fantastic book by Tana French, that I think everyone should read. Either way, I will be there for the next adventure with the Dublin Murder Squad."
"I’ve never liked crime novels, crime movies or even dressing up as a criminal on Halloween. However, this past year I’ve started reading Tana French, starting with Faithful Place. Last night, I finished The Trespasser.	The main character, Detective Antoinette Conway, is a much-disliked member of the Dublin Murder Squad. To be fair, her language, attitude, actions and full-throated anger, would not win her popularity contests in any setting. She and her partner, Steve, have been given a difficult case, made even more complicated by the fact that the victim struggled with many of the same issues that beleaguer Antoinette. 	Tana French is an amazing writer. As a reader, you are firmly and completely settled into Antoinette’s point of view. As the story unfolds, you see, hear and feel it from inside her head and heart. Of course, a strong point of view makes for engaging prose. I couldn’t put the book down. The dialogue is amazing, although many of the Irish idioms went straight over my head. Every page contains lots of swearing, but somehow swearing in Irish sounds quaint. (For example, the word “gobshite” can’t be too awful, right?)	Tana French never wastes a word or an action or a character. If she puts something on a page, it makes sense later. As you read, it’s worth your while to pay attention to details. 	What I love about Tana French’s writing is how meticulously and accurately she portrays the emotional landscape of her novel. As the story progresses, we see who people are at their core and get a glimpse of why they do what they do.	I loved the way The Trespasser ended. The plot provided enough twists and turns that I was surprised. Yet, when I went back over the details, I realized that the ending seemed inevitable. I won’t wreck the end for you, but I will say that the story wrapped up in a way that felt redemptive and satisfying.	Even if you have no stomach for crime novels, you may want to pick up one of Tana French's books just to check out her masterful writing."
"I had previously read a couple of Tana French's earlier novels about the Dublin Murder Squad and enjoyed them. For some reason, probably as I'd moved to a couple of other authors' stories, I had not read any more of them until now. I mention this because I'd not read the previous novel which featured Detectives Conway and Moran.

In The Trespasser, Conway and Moran are back in action, trying to solve a murder while fending off the attacks of their fellow Murder Detectives. Moran doesn't fit the profile that most of her fellow ""Ds"" and they'd just as soon push her out. Moran, who usually works as her partner, is hated almost as much in guilt by association.

As our story starts, the pair of Murder Ds have been working the night shift and just ready to go home when their boss assigns a new case. A beautiful young woman has been found dead in her cottage, and it looks like murder. They're tired and don't want the case, when the Gaffer (boss) makes it worse by assigning a senior, more experienced detective--read that as horse's ass--to ""help.""

As Conway and Moran untangle the young woman's murder, it quickly becomes apparent that the victim has ties to an old missing person case which will figure prominently in the murder, and in solving it. At this point anything else I say could be a major spoiler, so I won't write any more about he plot.

What I will tell you is that Tana French is an excellent writer. She presents unusual storylines that are simultaneously complex, yet simple. Her use of language and dialog is excellent, and there's good balance between moving the plot forward, while explaining the background and motivations of the characters in her stories. In The Trespasser, she pulls the reader into the story as she brings the characters to life. Even after the reader begins to suspect who the murderer is, the resolution doesn't happen until the end, and it's a real page-turner until then."
"The Trespasser is the sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French.    Whereas most detective/crime/mystery series follow the same narrative style, Tana French never does.    Each story is told from a different point of view and more than that, feels unique and somewhat daring.    This story is told by Antoinette Conway, a tough detective who does not give in to the attitudes and actions of her peers, building up a hard shell and a steady path toward doing her job well.

“Murder isn’t like other squads. When it’s working right, it would take your breath away: it’s precision-cut and savage, lithe and momentous, it’s a big cat leaping full-stretch or a beauty of a rifle so smooth it practically fires itself.”

We sometimes wonder if the author has provided us with an unreliable narrator.    We only have her account and the dialogues to go on.    The murder story may appear simple, but there are always secrets and false assumptions.    Much of the mystery is unfolded in long interrogations, masterfully written.  The whole tale is a slow burn, a psychological puzzle that we are invited to follow.

After many paths to solve the murder mystery, Conway states:

“I was doing exactly the same thing as Aislinn: getting lost so deep inside the story in my head, I couldn’t see past its walls to the outside world. I feel those walls shift and start to waver, with a rumble that shakes my bones from the inside out. I feel my face naked to the ice-flavored air that pours through the cracks and keeps coming. A great shiver is building in my back.”

As readers we are led down a path that follows those stories inside her head, and as the truth is revealed, we finally can  see past the facades and breathe more freely too.     This book requires some ""stick-to-it-iveness"" to get to the finale, but its well worth the effort.    All of Tana French's books are. 4.7/5 stars"
"Ever since I picked up In the Woods and The Likeness at a second-hand bookshop sale a couple of years ago, I have been a huge fan of Tana French. Her books have never disappointed me, and she’s just so consistently great. The Trespasser was no different.

One of the aspects of French’s books that is different from most murder mysteries is that the books focus almost more on the detectives than they do on the actual murder mystery. Her characters are brilliant: flawed, interesting, smart, and funny. The narrator of this one is all of those, and more. Her sarcasm is absolutely biting, her voice is bold, and you can’t help but love her.

Sometimes French’s mysteries are sort of predictable (Faithful Place, anyone?), but French is so damn good that it doesn’t even matter. What matters are the machinations, the little twists and turns, the motives, the interviews. Even though I had guessed at this one, there were still plenty of surprises, and I was breathless to the end. French understands that it’s not necessarily the Who that is important, but the Why.

You don’t need to read this series in order, necessarily, but I think you should. For one, they are just all amazing, and you will be sucked in and read them all anyway. Might as well start at the beginning, right? The second reason is that each narrator is introduced in the previous book. We have seen Conway before, in The Secret Place, but we had no idea what a badass, although sometimes a bit thick, D she really is.

These books are so memorable and thrilling. They stay with me long after I put them down, and they are genuinely one of the few books that it’s hard to pull myself away from. If you are at all interested in murder mysteries, or love deep characterization without having the patience for a typical character study-type genre, try these books out. You won’t regret it."
"Visserligen är jag väldigt svag för psykologiska spänningsromaner, men så skön känsla det var att läsa en riktigt välskriven, klassisk kriminalroman som den här!

Antoinette Conway och Stephen Moran får i uppdrag att utreda ett uppenbart partnermord. Ett fall som tycks enkelt att lösa och långt ifrån ett sådant uppdrag som kan ge de båda utredarna en högre status och bättre anseende på mordroteln. En uppklädd ung kvinna som väntar middagsbesök har fått sitt huvud spräckt mot en gaskamin. Kvinnans pojkvän tas in till förhör och det blir ganska snart uppenbart att han undanhåller viktig information.

Efter hundra sidor började jag undra hur det skulle kunna behövas 471 sidor till (!!) för att knyta ihop säcken. Men ju längre jag läste, desto mer önskade jag att boken aldrig skulle ta slut. Om det inte vore för att jag varken hade tid att äta, träna eller någonting annat, jag måste bara läsa vidare!

Det som till att börja med verkar vara en lättlöst mordhistoria visar sig dölja mycket under ytan och utredningen tar många olika vändningar. Ingenting hastas förbi och det känns som att få hänga med de båda mordutredarna i funderingar och diskussioner, och få sitta med under förhör och annat utredningsarbete. Det är så underhållande och spännande att jag riktigt myser.

Ja, det är en tegelstenstjock bok, men låt dig inte avskräckas av det. Tvärtom. Gläd dig åt att underhållningen pågår desto längre. Det här är en riktigt välskriven och klurig kriminalroman med fokus på utredningsarbetet och att lösa mordfallet.

Inkräktare är sjätte delen om Dublins mordrotel. De två mordutredarna återkommer från den femte delen, men dessförinnan har huvudpersonerna skiftat. Jag har inte läst någon av de tidigare delarna, och det är inte heller nödvändigt. Den här boken kan utan tvekan läsas fristående.
"
"The Trespasser, the first book I’ve read by Tana French, is a crime drama in her Dublin Murder Squad series (which is, I suspect, exactly what it sounds like). A recommendation from a friend, The Trespasser was an excellent read.

Maintaining a sense of mystery is crucial to a crime drama: the author must give the reader enough clues for the ending to fall into place believably, yet in a manner that is not obvious until it happens. This can be done in several ways, but French does so here through the first-person narrative of Det. Antoinette Conway, a tough-as-nails, take-no-B.S. detective who to the reader, just might be an unreliable narrator. Throughout, she is sleep-deprived, burned-out, and bullied at work. She and her partner theorize throughout the novel, and some of their theories are closer to the truth than others, but throughout, she is unsure whether she is “shaking trees” [another detective’s term, in the story]. And, in dealing with the other detectives, Conway's own experience makes her hyper-aware, correctly or not, in the way they approach her, she constantly guards herself against perceived interrogation techniques. Setting the book through her own eyes, the audience sees her constantly question her own judgment, her partners’ judgment, and the judgment and motivations of everyone around her. The audience also sees her trying to understand evidence, feeling that there is something she is missing, and on the cusp of breakthroughs. This all helps keep the suspense at a high pitch throughout.

French tells a compelling, tightly woven, incredibly readable story, and she does with compelling characterization and with a real honesty about what motivates people and how people lie. After reading this, I will be checking out French’s other books!"
"Wow, I'm working my way through the Dublin Murder Squad series and every one I start is a new journey. This one is told in the first person by DI Antoinette Conway who partnered with Steven Moran in The Secret Place. She has had a part in bringing Moran onto the Murder Squad and they are partners in this book as well - most of the time, anyway.
They get handed a file at the end of an overnight shift and go to find the victim, Aisleen Murray, dead in her style magazine flat. The Detective Superintendent gives them an older more experienced detective to help them along - they are relative newbies after all. DI Conway is the only female on the squad and she's touchy about the other members who she sees as picking on her and trying to get her to quit. She has nasty tricks played on her ie. someone peed in her locker, a witness signature page from her case goes missing, one of the detectives slaps her on the bum on her first day. But she's a good detective and she has a lot of solves.
We are led through the investigation step by step including some dead ends. Conway becomes more and more strung out until she doesn't even trust Moran for a time. Breslin, the more experienced detective, tries to take over the investigation and get it over with but Conway won't let him. She sticks to it, following all the leads until she and Moran have a proper solution. Not one they want though.
French is fantastic at setting the scene both with her descriptions of places and weather, and with her dialogue when she uses Irish slang. Her way of slowly building tension is masterful so the climax, when it comes, even if you're expecting it, is jolting. And she even gives a twist at the end of this book.
I need a few days before I start on the next book!"
"5*? Why would I award one of my rare 5 stars to a murder mystery genre by a female writer with the primary character being a female detective? Well . . . started listening to the Audiobook version, superbly narrated, came to know the characters and became totally engaged. However upon completion realized had probably become distracted on more than one occasion (and listening late at night, fallen asleep) -was so fascinated by the ending knew I had to fill in the blanks. So . . . about 3pm yesterday afternoon, started reading the e-book print version. A long delay for dinner - resumed at 9PM, continued after I retired for the night - with few eye blinks and not even any toe flexion - it was 3am and I had finished all 1100+ pages! Never before had I 'done' the same book twice, much less in such a short time-span. Ergo for me it had to be a 5*.

A very clever, detailed work of fiction - kept my brain working as the characters' reasoning and methods and thinking were constantly intriguing. So much more than an ordinary police procedural. Very clever dialogue (especially after listening to the Irish brogue on audiobook). Takes place in Dublin, Ireland; Antoinette Conway the only female Detective on the Murder Squad and partnered with wholly decent and clever partner Steve Moran. She's hazed by other detectives (tho not as totally as she believes), and is assigned to a domestic possible murder case. Very well-developed intriguing characters, interesting complicated clue-lines, many false leads (some given too much time, my only criticism). And a wonderfully unexpected satisfying ending. As you can tell I'm now an avid Tana French fan."
"As a perennial lover of Tana French, I nonetheless tend to take her books with a grain of salt; often, the cases are so clouded by the shaky, biased analysis of a jaded D that it’s hard to remember what happened after reflection. This story has much more staying power (don’t worry, no spoilers!)

Generally, I enjoy French’s writing, particularly her use of present tense, and while many criticize her books for their unreliable narrators and their murky endings, that’s one of the things I like best about them. After all, reality rarely wraps itself into a neat little package for us.

In this one, the murderer isn’t as hard to spot as some of the others, but the pacing may be the best of all her novels thus far. The evidence comes in disappointingly small crumbs at first, but then the story unfolds at a frenetic pace, backing away just often enough to stave off reader fatigue. Like many of her novels, the detective sharing the story has a personal relationship with the case. In this instance, however, there are two connections: one direct but small, the other is a parallel personal experience that is not directly related to the matter at hand. While the second connection clouds her judgment just a bit, it doesn’t pull NEARLY the focus that it did in “The Faithful Place,” “In the Woods,” or “Broken Harbor.” This is probably the greatest catalyst to the plot: a tie-in smooth enough to keep the engine running but not enough to take the wheels clean off. Overall, “The Secret Place” is still probably my favorite French novel (magic be damned), but this is a clear second favorite, and just a great read for when you want something smart, but not exhausting."
"Tana French's The Trespasser follows detective Antoinette Conway as she and her partner Steve investigate the case of a young woman murdered in her house. French's biggest strength as a writer is how she delves into the her main characters. The murder plot, to me, was the least interesting part of the book. I was more invested in Antoinette and her (platonic) relationship with Steve, her struggles within the Murder Squad, and just in general getting to spend time with her (I do wish she didn't call women bitches so much). For me, French's female protagonists are always more captivating than her male ones; the women are complicated and difficult and authentic. So far, the men I just don't like very much.

A couple years ago, I learned about Elemental Genre, which is basically the type of element that drives the story forward. The Elemental Genres are wonder, idea, adventure, horror, mystery, thriller, humor, relationship, drama, issue, and ensemble. While the obvious Elemental for a mystery book is mystery, to me French's books are equal parts drama as they are mystery. The growth and journey of her main characters is the true driving force of the story. I enjoy the depth and complexity of French's writing and it really sets her apart - and I'm not really a mystery buff - from other mystery writers.

The actual murder plot didn't really start going for me until the last third of the book. I guessed pretty immediately whodunit but once the mystery started unraveling it still captured my full attention and I was hooked. I started listening to the audio book and ended up getting the eBook so I could finish it. I couldn't wait to know the ending. The audio book is quite good and very entertaining because it's read with an Irish accent that really helps set the scene.

While not my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad mystery series - that so far is still The Likeness - this one was excellent and I highly recommend it."
"A Victor Hugo-esque attention to detail, brain teaser, police procedural. Tana French writes a novel the reader can well sink their teeth into. Those several-sentence-long descriptions of the environment set up a dense but captivating read. You can almost smell the tea in the interview room or hear the keyboards clacking in the incident room.

I always, always love authors who write *people* over characters. Tana French does exactly that - she doesn’t write a thinly described, developed, shell of a person. She writes people in all their depth, complications, triumphs, loyalties, and failures. You love to be exasperated with Conway for the chip on her shoulder, for her deep seated mistrust of everyone around her. You’re curious about who Moran really is, outside of Conway’s biased view of him. You’re interested to know if all the other detectives on the squad really are that bad or if that’s Conway’s bias, her mistrust, her wariness, getting in the way.

This isn’t an action book. You’ll find no hair raising, nail biting, back sweating moments. I kind of expected that, from the title, but I’m not disappointed. Not in the least. This is a book about how an already complicated relationship is just the tip of the ice berg: you only see 10% of the iceberg until the other 90% hits you from below. This is a book about how normal people, even mostly good people, can do something wrong, something bad, something with permanent consequences. This is a book about how, sometimes, doing the right thing can still leave you feeling pensive and uneasy.

All in all, a great read from Tana French. I’m looking forward to reading the other 5 novels that come before this!"
"Probably my favorite Tana French book in the series so far. Antoinette Conway is as tough as nails, as witty as all get out, and as paranoid as they come. Her partnership with Steve Moran, the young rookie started off rocky in the previous book but is solidified with this case. She is convinced that the rest of the Murder Squad detests her and is plotting against her at every turn.

Aislinn Murray, an attractive young woman is found dead in her flat, a blunt force injury to her head which may or may not have been accidental. Additional evidence indicates that she was punched and fell against a sharp surface. She has a complicated past including a father who went missing, involving the Dublin police force in his search which Aislinn was led to believe was unsuccessful.

As in most of Ms. French's books there is a tangled cobweb of interrelationships and subterfuge that she and Steve must slice through. The quest leads them in an many directions but ultimately back to their own squad room. To get to the heart of the story, Conway and Moran must assume many faces: bickering partners, sympathetic shoulders, naive do-gooders. With Conway providing the point of view we get an inside view of the workings of the investigation.

The writing is masterful, the characters beautifully developed, and the settings gorgeously portrayed. The plot takes time to develop and gets a bit droopy in spots but quickly picks up pace, heading for French's signature suspenseful climax and resolution.

I can't wait to read more about Conway and Moran. They are a perfect partnership...and I'm glad that Conway finally came to realize that!"
"Fantastic job! Love the readers Irish accent! Great book - very quick read!

A brilliant new novel from the New York Times bestselling author, whom Gillian Flynn calls ""mesmerizing"" and Stephen King calls ""incandescent."" Being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she's there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she's getting close to the breaking point. Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers' quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There's nothing unusual about herexcept that Antoinette's seen her somewhere before. And that her death won't stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn's boyfriend, fast. There's a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be. Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can't tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?From the Hardcover edition."
"My favorite book in the series so far! When I started the series, I was very disappointed with the open ended conclusion of the first book, but since then I have read through the rest of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books and have really enjoyed them.

So far, the highlights in the series for me have been: The Likeness and The Trespasser. These are the two out of six books in the series which have female protagonists, which may be a part of why I enjoyed the books so much, but I do not think it is the only reason. The Likeness dealt with the complications and psychology behind going undercover, which I found riveting. The Trespasser plays on a different psychology: being the outsider and being hazed for that marginality. Unfortunately, I found the concept of a female (woman of color, in this case) police detective being the outsider in an otherwise entirely male squad completely probable, and that is why this book intrigued me from the start. As with the other books in the series, the reader was introduced to the protagonist in a previous book. When we meet Antoinette Conway in the previous book, The Secret Place, it is clear that she has a lot to prove and that she definitely has a chip on her shoulder. Here, we see why Conway has her guard up by exploring both her professional and personal background.

A winner of a book: it contains intriguing psychological avenues, the red herrings traditional with mysteries, and a level of anxiety as the reader, and Antoinette Conway, considers who she can trust."
"Two things led me to this book: the bookstore didn't have the Julia Keller book I was looking for, and a fellow writer had suggested I check out Tana French's ""In the Woods,"" which I considered. In the end, I picked ""The Tresspasser,"" and am glad I did.

I confess I'm USA-centric, rarely picking up a novel by a non-American or set outside the US. That's for no other reason than I prefer books set in places I've been. Tana French is pretty far afield from that: an Irish author, a book set in Dublin.

Have I said I'm glad I picked this book?

Start with a beleaguered detective on the Murder Squad who's had it up to her eyeballs with the nasty treatment she's been getting as a rare female on the squad and whose past hasn't done anything to dispel their wariness. Add a case that, on its surface, looks like an open-and-shut domestic killing. Mix in a slew of red herrings, a partner who might or might not be part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Toss in some twists and turns and surprises. Stir thoroughly.

Though I had a bit of a struggle with the colloquialisms, I caught the meaning of most, and was rarely left in the dark about the meaning of something that seemed significant. I'm actually thinking about integrating ""gobsmacker"" into my everyday conversation.

The Associated Press review says it better (and more succinctly) than I can: ""French not only spins a twisty cop tale, she also encases it in meticulous prose, creating a read that is as elegant as it is dark.""

Amen.

Conway and Moran are teamed up again in The Trespasser, except it is Conway who is the primary character.  It was great to see how she and Moran compliment each other, in true partner style, rather than their mentor/mentee relationship in The Secret Place.  While she came across as bossy and defensive in The Secret Place, it was interesting to have more insight as to why she behaved as she did and the difficulties she faced on the job.  Anyone that has experienced bullying could identify with the feelings of mistrust and resentment that grow as a result and how it taints all relationships.

The crime in The Trespasser didn’t take a back stage to the character development, as with a couple of the other books in the series.  I enjoyed this installment about as much as In the Woods; maybe more so  because of the unexpected direction of the actual crime and how the author handled the ending.

Narration:
Hilda Fay did a nice job interpreting Conway's brusque character as well as the remaining, primarily male, characters. I listened at 1.25x for most of the book and slowed it down a couple of times to make sure I caught all of the dialogue during some of the interviews.

"My preordered copy came in the day before Rosh Hashanah. On the second day, after services were over (my synagogue runs short and under-populated on the second day), the house quiet without electricity and my toddler at daycare, the idea of just reading a little was unbelievably tempting, albeit borderline sacrilegious. And of course, once I started, Tana French's writing was addictive.

I remember very little of the ""central"" mystery. What I remember about is the creeping, burning embarrassment of self-recognition reading about how Antoinette Conway nearly let a mystery go unsolved because she was so caught up in how others saw her. Many mystery novels have the ""stupid plot"" error, where an idiot could solve the mystery if they simply followed the obvious clues, and so the writers have to make the brilliant detective look over the one clear next step to prevent the novel from early closure. In this case, there's no inconsistency: French's novel is literally about the narrative that Conway tells about herself of being an isolated loner. The mystery is window-dressing for the consequences of letting yourself be seduced into such a narrative, and the hard climb back out.

So in the end, it was pretty apropos of the holiday -- I'm definitely guilty of perpetuating negative self-narratives, and choosing to fail rather than challenge them. And I felt inspired by French to try to do better this year."
"I love Tana French's novels and have been a fan since her first book. Every one has been dark and twisty, so if you are looking for sunshine and happiness this is not the place. What is outstanding is the gritty reality of the life and mind of a Murder detective. As much as the story is about the crime itself, it is also about the mental and emotional state of the protagonist. In The Trespasser, that protagonist is Antoinette Conway. From the beginning we see things from her eyes and along the way we learn that there is no such thing as separation of personal and work lives. No matter how hard we try, one's personal life, experience, and emotional state will impact how you view everything else in your life. In this novel, this is true of both Antionette and the victim. The way Antoinette comes to terms with this skewed view is very realistic. The phrase, ""just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you"" comes to mind but it is also true that ""perception is reality"". Sometimes it is necessary to change one's perception in order to see the truth. Thanks to French's writing, I have no trouble visualizing the members of Dublin's Murder Squad, the city, the neighborhoods, the weather. All are important to the story, when I read one of these novels, I am there with them and I am never bored."
"I love Tana French's books (this is my sixth) but there are some pluses and minuses that are worth understanding to assess them for yourself, and Trespasser exemplifies them all. I pride myself on reading a couple of books a week, and her books don't easily fall into this approach-- often I zip through another book while pausing Tana's books, not that they are ""not page turners"" -- they are -- but they take so much time (if you buy books valuing them by the word then these are quite a bargain).

She takes the time to really develop her characters -- you get to know them so well. All detective books seem to have dysfunctional characters, but hers are way more interesting not contrived -- quite believable and engaging not just dysfunctional to fit any formula but more in the realm of ""we're all dysfunctional in some way"" -- it's what makes us human.

While there's some ""who done it"" to all these books, her's are way more involved. If you're guessing at the ending you may or may not be right (you'll likely change your mind repeatedly) but it won't matter as the endings are so much richer -- it's not just, ""ah that's the evil one"" or""that's the clue I missed (or caught)"" but rather more ""wow, now it all makes so much more sense."" Tana's characters are rarely black-and-white evil-but way more human.

I loved this book and in the end wished it hadn't ended.

"This is the second book by French where I've listened to the audio version and been totally pulled into the story...this one I think even more than The Secret Place. It was incredibly easy to finish doing something while listening to the book (cooking, dishes, laundry, etc.) and just say ""a few more minutes"" of sitting and listening - and for it to then be an hour later! The reader (Hilda Fay) was fabulous, with consistent and recognizable voices for the secondary characters along with a convincing passionate / angry / doubting / analytical Conway. The Trespasser felt a little heavier on the police procedural than The Secret Place, but it worked really well with being told from Conway's point of view as she consistently evaluates and judges the place she had worked so hard to get to and therein makes it familiar to the reader without feeling comfortable. French includes a lot of insightful narration from Conway which occasionally pushes the boundary of being too good or too much like reading someone's mind, but ends up playing well because of the detective angle and the personality French builds for her. Although I felt like the gang angle was a bit of a stretch from the beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed the way the truth was unraveled and can't believe how quickly I made it through the 20 hours of audio!

"Creo que os he mencionado a #tanafrench en alguna ocasión, pero nunca he profundizado mucho. Para mi es una autora imprescindible con un talento que te agarra las pupilas y te impide que dejes de recorrer los renglones de sus páginas. Os pongo un extracto de la última novela publicada en España y la última que leí para que juzguéis vosotros: ""Nadie ""necesita"" una relación. Lo único que se necesita es sentido común a nivel usuario para deducirlo pese al bombardeo de chorradas de los medios, que te gritan que no eres nada si estás sola y, si no piensas lo mismo, eres rara y peligrosa. La verdad es que si no eres capaz de existir por ti misma, es que no existes. Y no solo en el plano amoroso. Yo quiero a mi madre y a mis amigos, los quiero a muerte. Si cualquiera me pidiera que le donara un riñón o partiera algunas cabezas, lo haría, sin preguntas. Y si todos me dijeran hasta luego y se fueran de mi vida mañana, seguiría siendo la misma persona que soy hoy.
Yo vivo dentro de mi propia piel; todo lo que pasa fuera no cambia quien soy. No es que esté orgullosa, para mí es un simple requisito de partida mínimo para considerarse un ser humano adulto, al mismo nivel que saber poner una lavadora o cambiar el rollo del papel higiénico. Me dan ganas de escupirles a todos esos idiotas de las páginas, que ruegan que otros muevan sus hilos colgantes, que los hagan reales."""
"I'm a big fan of Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad stories. Each one is a stand alone book that will feature a character or characters from previous books. The Trespasser is the story of Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Detective Stephen Moran. The main plot centers around the murder of a Aislinn Murray, a young woman who didn't seem to have any enemies, and was not involved with crime, or criminals, or anything untoward. There is an obvious suspect, yet Conway and Moran sense there is much more than meets the eye. The plot has many unexpected turns, and there are a few subplots that serve as interesting and exciting diversions.
Antoinette Conway is a complicated woman. She's had a difficult life, and as the only woman on the murder squad she has many hurdles to clear. At first I found her too hot tempered and rather off-putting, the writing style is such that you feel like you're actually in her head as she searches for clues, deals with co-workers and works through her own issues. Her internal monolog runs constantly and you get a front row seat to figuring out exactly who she is. The mystery unfolds and stalls a few times, as new evidence begins to lead Conway and Moran in a different and possibly more dangerous direction. I don't want to give anything away so I'll close by saying I give this book 5/5 stars!"
"Tana, O Tana (I so adore ya)

There are few authors I follow where I read the next, then the next. What is so much fun with this author is the nuance of darkness and personal revelation in the lead D's (detective) own story as they move through their assigned investigation. There is an ancillary character that becomes the main character in a subsequent book. Never is the outcome what I surmise. This one was particularly poignant in a few ways. I love the office politics ( boisterous and cagey; these are murder detectives) and that particular cop pecking order, loyalty, expectations and going against the ""squad posse"" to pursue what your gut is telling you. French shows error and brilliance, self doubt and self assurance all in the same deductive reasoning. She captures that murder-solve giftedness; portraying the lead detective both confident, shakey, paranoid, and spot-on as they move through their cases. She shines the light on their peer, partner and authority relationships, suspects, and their connection to their own injuries through perceived and real injustices. Her detailed description of the detective methodology is a nuts and bolts understanding; of course humanity is never predictable and this one had an inspiring surprise ending in my opinion.

Love your work, Tana French. Thank you for gifting us with your kaleidoscope picture of human nature."
"Star ratings are fairly meaningless from me regarding Tana French. I love pretty much all of her books, its just a matter of small degrees. And I read this in such a binge that it's going to be a while before I can be really subjective about it. But I was really excited to get into Antoinette Conway's head, and, as usual, French does not disappoint.

The crime, buried beneath layers of possible motivation and everyone's different stories, is actually fairly straightforward. It's just a matter of untangling whodunit, and the answer, to me, was not that shocking.

The real depth and joy is in the buildup of paranoia in Conway's head. It is intense. And even when they chase leads and theories that appear ridiculous, Conway's thoughts make them seem plausible and real.

I loved the way the characters were dug into. And I really love how Conway and Moran bounce off one another--I liked it in The Secret Place, but I thought Moran was a bit of a blank wall as a character. He still is, here, trying to be what everyone wants him to be--but the way he and Conway work together is fascinating. I'd love to see them again in the Murder Squad, though I'm not sure it will happen. I'm already wondering who French will tackle next."
"It was my first read of a ""Dublin Murder Squad"" story by Tana French - so even it is numbered as #6, you can totally enjoy this without having read the previous ones, as the story is not really connected to the other ones, but stands for itself. A murder happened and the protagonist Detective Conway is searching for who's done it and why together with her partner Detective Moran.

I've never read a true detective novel before, and am happy this was my first because it was that good in my opinion. The protagonist is a lady who kicks ass, not so much in the physical sense but with her attitude - for some reason she reminded me a whole lot of Annalise Keating from 'How to get away with murder'....I couldn't stop picturing her in my head during dialogues and inner thoughts of the protagonist of this book. Furthermore, I enjoyed that the slow pace of the story, while the whole thought process of the detectives, as well as interviews of suspects and witnesses, were so detailed...I felt like a fly on the wall of an actual investigation! Even when I learned ""who's done it"", the story still kept me turning page after page because I wanted to know how it all played out.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book - 4 stars alone for the protagonist - so 5/5 it is!"
"This series is so amazing. Every book has a different set of characters but some of them appear as minor characters in other books. In this one Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran are handed a case at the end of a long stressful shift. Why is Detective Breslin assigned to work with them? Everything about the case convinces Antoinette that everyone in the station is plotting to get rid of her.

Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home. She was expecting someone for dinner. Who turned off the stove? Was it an accident that killed her or was it murder? Aislinn's boyfriend is pitiful. Is he really as hopeless as he appears or is he a stalker? What's he hiding? What's Aislinn's friend Lucy hiding?

Who's been stalking Aislinn? Who's stalking Antoinette? Is Breslin a bent cop? Are gangs involved in the murder? What's in the folder on Aislinn's computer with the secret password? Antoinette and Steve are all over the map on this case. Why does the chief want a report from them every day? Who gave the slimy reporter Antoinette's address?

I was all over on this one too. The ending surprised me as much as it did all of the detectives. This was a rollicking good murder mystery."
"Twists and turns, relationships that are up and down, loyalties that evolve, a crime that isn’t what it seems and an investigation that goes where no one expects it to.

That’s ""The Trespasser,"" the latest novel by gifted writer Tana French. It is well worth reading, even if thrillers are not a genre you’ve been drawn to before, because French gives her work a depth many such writers do not.

Dublin detectives Antoinette Conway and partner Steve Moran of the Murder Squad catch a case that should be a slam-dunk domestic. But it is not. Oy, it is not.

French’s novels arc to the extent that characters from one carry over to a new book but you do not need to have read the novel that immediately preceded this one to enjoy the action that unfolds before you.

Be advised that Conway, the female protagonist, is angular and edgy; she wins your support slowly and as the story progresses. The novel’s complexities are indeed knotty and several key conversations go on considerably, as the detectives consider all the potential scenarios and suspects. Nothing here unspools the way a 60- minute TV police procedural does, and that takes a patient reader.

But your time is well spent and you’ll be riveted by what you read.
"
"The perspective of this one reminded me a lot of the first two books (Into the Woods, and The Likeness), in that this is the second book to follow partners Conway and Moran. The Secret Place was from Moran's perspective and this was from Conway's. I really like this method as the two perspective coordinate to give full dimension to the characters.

This case was interesting; it seemed to fall together so simply, but not quite perfectly... and Moran's alternatives kept stretching wilder and wilder, but nothing quite felt right with all the facts...

Mixed in with the case was a lot of conflict within the department and of course, Conway has do deal with her own demons while chasing down a murderer.

In short, this is another outing with the Dublin Murder Squad that illustrates why it is a great series and showcases French's skill in crafting complex characters, relationships, and unique ways to wrap up murder cases.

While I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I am glad that there aren't any more of them out right now; I am certainly not bored of them, but the feel of them is getting too similar, so that I need to read some other stuff for a while, then when French writes more I can come back and be wowed by her unique take on the detective novel!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this sixth foray into the Dublin Murder Squad scene and have little to nothing I didn't like about it, thus the 5* rating. I haven't read all of the previous in the series (but will be rectifying that soon) so, while I guessed our protagonist Antoinette wasn't new to us by some of the references in this novel, I most certainly enjoyed getting to know her here.
She's flawed, she's angry, she's extremely negative (too introspective at times would be my minor complaint about this novel) but she's also realistic - you can see why she is like this and while the reader may not be able to empathise, they can certainly accept that she is a plausible character. All of the characters generally are in this novel, which adds to the enjoyment. If you're going to be reading about the dark and dirty side of Dublin crime, you need characters you could picture easily in that setting.
The story itself was interesting from the get-go, and while the 'reveal' happens a little before the end, you're still gripped wondering how will everything actually turn out. Well-written, lots of nice forensic and technical detail to make it (again) realistic, with twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. I do suspect though that we will meet Antoinette again (her family story leads me to believe we will learn more at a later novel)."
"My reviews of Tana French’s books are becoming shorter and shorter as it becomes more evident that I love everything she does.

In the previous Dublin Murder Squad novel, I gave my lowest rating of any of her works due to the unnecessary supernatural elements and my disinterest in the detectives Moran and Conway. In this novel, Moran and Conway are again the focus, and in the first half I thought this was more of the same. Instead, French worked her magic (as she has time and again) and created a depth of character that has you understanding and empathizing with them.
I found I disliked Conway as I was constantly tense- her perspective being a difficult persona to live in, as she always has her back up, analyzing every interaction. At several points, Breslin and Moran pointed out my exact issues with Conway. And from there, she was able to grow. The character depth and progression in French’s works are exemplified in this novel.

Further, the mystery itself was interesting, as well as seeing theories not come to fruition. Often I find that it seems too easy, that the detective comes to the right conclusion and all the pieces line up and ~ta da~ the case is solved. This was much more realistic, and made them work for it."
"I've read all of the Dublin Murder Squad books and this is my favorite. Unlike many series, each book is stand alone although the characters were introduced in the book before. I think that the reason that I like this one so much is because the characters and situation felt complicated but real. The main character dealt with biases where she didn't realize how much they were affecting her at first. The twists and turns kept you guessing and while the ending wasn't a huge twist there were definitely some unknowns. The main character was far from perfect but I liked her. The others were sometimes hard to get a handle on because the story was told from her perspective but I think is part of what I enjoyed.

I listened to this book and enjoyed it; however, the narrator sometimes had trouble distinguishing the different characters. I sometimes couldn't tell the difference between the main detective and her partner, especially when they were having conversations. Not enough to not follow the plot but enough to be troubling. Some of her accents were strange and my husband heard part and asked if it was someone doing a fake Irish accent when it was someone with a lovely Irish accent trying to do different voices for the different characters."
"""You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that.""

Murder detective, Antoinette Conway, isn't just struggling with her current case, she's also battling her entire squad, who harass and intimidate her to no end. At first glance, her latest investigation - into the murder of the seemingly ordinary Aislinn Murray - looks like a cut and dry one: the boyfriend did it.

But nothing about the case wants to be tied up in a little bow and filed away. What's more, Conway is certain she's seen Aislinn somewhere before. And, Conway's partner, Stephen Moran, is convinced something even more sinister than domestic abuse is behind Aislinn's murder. When friends are few, and enemies seem to be everywhere, Conway can rely only on herself and Stephen.

Tana French's books are more than murder mysteries, they're also character studies. Her protagonists seem more real than those of many other crime fiction writers. Conway is a difficult personality, seemingly cold and stuck-up. But her vulnerabilities are laid bare brilliantly and sensitively. French is probing and insightful while maintaining tensions throughout the book.

"I'm not a big murder mystery fan, but I have loved every Tana French murder mystery I've read! I finally managed to get around to reading this one, which definitely didn't disappoint.

Murder mysteries are often a fast read for me, but with French's novels I often find that it takes me a while to read them. They're extremely vivid and compelling, and I find myself reading slowly to make sure that I catch all the clues - but not so that I can solve it by myself, interestingly enough. I'm notorious at home for guessing plot twists ahead of time, but with French I tend to be happy just letting the mystery unfold in front of me. I still like to have caught all the clues so that when the mystery wraps up I can put all of them together, but it's much more about enjoying the journey.

Also, French's characters consistently impress me. Conway is a complex character - if I met her in real life, I probably wouldn't like her, but as a protagonist she was extremely compelling. She does show the deep problems with current police structures, through the descriptions of her work and the narrative you have to build in order to think you're the one in the right, along with the toxic atmosphere around her.

All in all, another excellent mystery from French!"
"This book reaffirmed that Tana French is one of the best murder mystery writers out there. I struggled to put it down and grappled with the mystery even when I wasn't reading.

The plot revolves around the investigation into the death of an attractive young woman, Aisleen Murray, whose body was found lying over the floor of her apartment with a punch on her face and a blow against the fireplace which, most likely, was the cause of her death. While it all seems like a standard murder- nothing is quite what it seems as details begin to unravel.

Now at first, the story seems extremely procedural and various theories abound as to why this young woman was killed. I started to wonder when the plot would get interesting. But before you know it, the book becomes a convoluted psychological study of characters with a shocking ending.

One of Tana's strengths is how she controls the readers' feelings toward each character. At times you have sympathy and at other times you loathe a character. It's an intense journey. As usual, in the Dublin Murder Squad Series, pieces of the story start and stop fitting, truths and lies spill out.

A fascinating read with all the elements of a fiery mystery.

"Great book and this my third read. Still love it.
I generally like all of the Tana French books although Broken Harbour was disappointing (Scorcher is not a character that I felt I could warm to) and I didn’t like the plot of Wych Elm.
For me, the Trespasser is French at her best. I love the character of Antionette Conway. So spiky and sarcastic. She says all the things my evil twin would, and genuinely does not GAF.
The relationship between Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, is beautifully drawn out. You get a lovely sense of how they bring out the best in each other, despite any problems.
The murder plot is nicely paced, interspersed with evocative scene setting. The twists, when they come, are perfectly judged so afterwards you think maybe they were obvious but they aren’t.
This novel about stories, the power of them on ourselves and others, slips and turns on itself throughout, like the sense that Conway has of Aislinn, the murder victim. Always changing and you never quite know which interpretation is real.
A definite recommend from me, ideally read curled up next to the fire with wet Dublin-esque winter weather outside."
"Wieder ein echter Tana French! Ich bin begeistert!
Diesmal steht Antoinette Convey im Mittelpunkt der Erzählung, die wieder zusammen mit Steve Moran aus dem letzten Teil (Geheimer Ort) die Ermittlung zu einer zunächst scheinbar eindeutigen Beziehungstat leitet. Tana French - für mich eine Thrillerautorin mit der Gabe aus Wörtern lebendige Bilder mit Nachhall zu erschaffen - hat es auch in diesem Roman wieder geschafft, eine Erzählstimme zu erschaffen, die der Hauptperson glaubwürdig entspricht. Da Convey eher der nüchterne, abgeklärte Typ ist, war ich zunächst von der unschnörkeligen Erzählweise irritiert, die ich in einem French-Roman nicht erwartet hatte. Doch auch hier wirkt er überzeugend und ich habe mich um so mehr über die Stellen gefreut, an denen die Sprachgwaltigkeit der Autorin doch noch durchblitzte.
Wie immer sind Fall, Täter, Opfer und Ermittler emotional und biographisch sehr stakt ineinander verwoben und die verschiedenen Twists in der Story herrlich ausgearbeitet.
Meine absolute Empfehlung bekommt dieser Roman auf jeden Fall. Ich freue mich auf den nächsten Fall aus der Dubliner Burg."
"This one is told by Antoinette Conway, the second detective in The Secret Place. They're paired now on the murder squad, but it hasn't been her dream job. She's tired of the constant harassment by the 'old boys,' tired of getting the least desired cases, like their latest, a seemingly open and shut case of a young woman killed while prepping a dinner for her new love- the immediate suspect. But her friend hints there was another romance that may have been dangerous, and they're off chasing what ifs. What if she was dating a married man, or a gangster? And when their supervising detective is flashing cash and seeming to interfere in their investigation, what if he's on the take and covering up for some gangster? Turns out they're onto something- she was seeing another detective from their squad. And she set out to do so very deliberately, to seduce him and wreck his life as payback because years earlier he was the investigator when her father disappeared, and he chose not to tell her mum the dad was alive and well and shacking up with a new woman. He thought he was sparing them the hurt of deliberate abandonment, she feels he stole time she would have had with her dad. "
"Crime is decidedly not my genre, but Tana French is on my list of authors for whom I'll read anything they write (even if it takes me awhile to get to it.)

Like every DMS book, The Tresspasser is about the crime and the investigation, but actually more about the investigators. Every story has a whiff of the detective protagonist being both the best and the absolute worst person to work the case, because something about their experiences makes them attuned to some frequency that others wouldn't pick up on, but at the same time, that frequency gets inside their heads and exploits their insecurities. The way that French really turns these people inside out is really something.

I'm not going to go too into depth raving about this book in particular because my rating and overall high opinion of the series speaks for itself, but I will say that I particularly enjoyed Antoinette Conway as a narrator. To call her ""prickly"" would be an understatement, but of course, there is a lot going on underlying her demeanor. Just a fascinating character and a really thoughtful portrayal by French."
"What I Did Like:
The pacing is wonderful. You’re sucked in early because the detectives see things you want answers to. Then it picks up speed and you just can’t stop reading. You have to know.
I like the realism of the characters. We all get in our own heads and see things differently than they’re really happening. This plays up on that with a lot of characters. It’s realistic and I loved it.
Incredibly satisfying mystery. You get answers you want in a way that feels like real detective work. It reads like it could happen.

Who Should Read This One:
If you like detective novels, this is among the best. This author does her research and writes about detectives who follow procedures in ways other authors skip or get lazy on. It’s beautiful.
If you like to connect to characters in a deep way and want to try a mystery, try this one. Conway and Moran are solid characters and you’ll love getting to know them.

My Rating: 5 Stars
Beautifully written, this is a solid story that I’d recommend to any reader.

"Neljas Tana Frenchi raamat ja teine, mis sai loetud inglise keeles. The Trespasser iseenesest on küll sarja 6 raamat, kuid lood on üsna iseseisvad, nii et järjekord pole niivõrd oluline. Valisin raamatu seetõttu, et eelmist raamatut Faithful Place lõpetades - lugesin e-raamatuna - pakkus Kindle Trespasseri esimest peatükki tutvustuseks ja äärmiselt soodsat hinda. Selles raamatus nagu ka Dublin Murder Squad nr 5 ""The Secret Place"" (mida hetkel loen), on peategelasteks detektiivipaar Antoinette Conway ja Steven Moran. Kui nr. 5 räägib lugu Moran, siis Trespasser antakse edasi Conway pilgu läbi. Peale kontrolliva ema surma on Aislinn muutunud säravaks liblikaks, kes leitakse surnult oma korterist. Kas tegemist on tahtliku tapmisega või õnnetusega kukkumise läbi, on nüüd detektiivipaari uurida. Conwayd ja Moranit ärritab, et ülemus on nende meeskonnale lisanud ""nõuandjaks"" veel ühe detektiivi, kes neile kummalegi ei meeldi. Nõuandja püüab kindla käega suunata neid ilmselge süüdlase, ehk kuriteopaiga läheduses viibinud kohtingupartneri poole. Alguses paistabki lugu lihtsalt lahenevat ... "
"The Trespasser is no disappointment to Tana French fans: dark and complex, with a grey, downtrodden feel to the entire enterprise and everyone in it. It would all be frankly depressing to read without a few slivers of light: 1) This woman can WRITE. Her work transcends description: The surprising details she scatters throughout make her characters and their motivations ring true. You can feel the weather for yourself, you feel as if you walked down those streets next to the character. It's remarkable. 2) She doesn't write a simple linear story. Her characters are as complex and messed up as real people are, and the reader walks among them and waits to see how they will behave next as the story twists its way around. It takes longer than you think it should because life is like that and you're so drawn in, you will read every page until it's done and then think about it for weeks afterward. 3) She has such a gift for flashes of bitter humor and sharply funny dialogue. I always wonder if the Irish are as negative as these books would imply, but somehow I love them all the more for it. "
"Take a great police procedural story, make it a psychological thriller, and write it with a level of detail that really sucks you into the characters and their situation, while still being an easy-to-read book. As always, I am in awe of Tana French, absolutely the best author that most people have never heard of.

Detective Antoinette Conway has achieved her ambition of working in the Dublin Murder Squad. But that's not turning out so well for her. She's not fitting in with the team - her paperwork gets stolen or destroyed, people spit in her tea, and she's getting increasingly paranoid about the motives of those working with her. Is her latest murder case a simple domestic accident, or gangland murder? Can she trust her witness, her colleagues, and her old friend to tell her the truth? Does everyone have ulterior motives or is she just paranoid?

Who doesn't love a story? French also invites us to think about that most important story of all, our own psyche, and how the story we create about ourselves impacts our thoughts and behaviour. Fascinating."
"All of the buzz around this book at the start of the year inspired me to go back to the beginning and read all of Tana French’s books in order — and now I’m sad to have reached the end of this series!

French is satisfyingly consistent; her books are all well written and well paced, and (to her great credit, in my opinion) instead of spinning out the plot in unbelievable directions, she keeps the central mystery tightly focused. I like the fact that her books are just as much about the contours of working class Irish life as they are about chasing plot developments, which allows her to engage pretty meaningfully with class. I love thrillers, but there are a lot of trashy ones out there; I appreciate how much French has done to elevate the genre.

This one was no exception. I really enjoyed it, particularly because I liked the prickly narrator a lot. (They’re all prickly, but a female detective who’s grappling with gender dynamics and imposter syndrome especially speaks to me.) A great way to close out my reading list for the year."
"Figuring out what to rate this was complicated. After seeing some negative reviews of this, and after finding book 5 to be fairly disappointing, I lowered my expectations for Trespasser. I hated Conway's character in book 5, so I was concerned she would be difficult to connect to.

I was wrong.

Perhaps it's the shared experience of having to prove yourself because of your gender. I understood her thick skin and her need to feel on guard. And I loved her rapport with Moran.

That being said, around halfway through the book she becomes *deeply* unlikeable, and my score started dropping in my mind. But French manages to make her sympathetic even after that, and where she ends up is positive and satisfying.

Not to mention, the story feels like the most twisty and turny yet, constantly blowing away my expectations. The ending is fantastic. Definitely felt like a 5 when I finished it.

My enjoyment order of the series:

Broken Harbour > The Likeness > In the Woods / Trespasser (tied) > [large gap] Secret Place > Faithful Place"
"First experience with Tana French. I love Michael Connolly and this is a police procedural much like Connolly’s great Bosch books. French’s books are set in Dublin and for this at least the cop is a woman with a younger male partner. They are handed a case involving a young woman found dead in her apartment with a blow to the head. Similar to Connolly’s there are intricate case details to follow to the resolution. There are relationships with other cops that are good and bad. Unlike Harry Bosch however, the lead detectives do not have the benefit of admiration and in fact face derision from their peers. Fighting thru the obstacles placed in front of them, the red herrings they conjure themselves and the self interest of other detectives makes for an arduous course. Overriding all this however is gut wrenching, heartstring pulling and devastatingly raw dialogue from Ms French. She takes much longer with the interview scenes than Mr Connolly but it is worth it. The last 15% of the book is unputdownable for its intensity, honesty yet surprisingly real resolution. Pretty impressive "
"I'm really sad that I've now read all the books in this series, and I have no idea how I'll survive until Tana French publishes the next installment. Perhaps eat my weight in ice cream while re-reading the entire series!

I could go on about French's talents forever, but I'll suffice with saying that she is one of the most talented crime writers out there and this was (as usual) an excellent novel with complex characters, a clever plot and beautiful writing. French draws you into this world and always makes so many insightful observations about crime and justice, human nature and relationships. She creates tense atmospheres with ease, and captures witness interviews like no other writer.

She creates complex flawed characters and Antoinette Conway, the tough lone female detective on the Dublin Murder Squad, is no exception. She was an interesting character and I became really invested in her story and her partnership with Stephen Moran was excellently done.

I can't wait until French writes the next installment in the series.

5*"
"I recently discovered Tana French and have gobbled up all her books in less than one year. Some I have liked more than others but all have been at least good and at best excellent. This one & Broken Harbor are my favorites. Her specialty is getting inside the heads of the detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad. The cast of characters appear in more than one book, with minor characters becoming major ones in future books. I read them out of order and still enjoyed them but I think reading in order would add to the experience.

French has an ear for dialogue that is spot-on, particularly police vernacular. She gets under the skin of the men & women she writes about and just nails the details. It makes me realize how few police procedurals get the details so right. Her books are always long but really take you on a long, deep, character-driven ride that doesn't skimp on surprises that are earned rather than cheap ploys for attention. She has fast become one of my top ten favorite authors.

"
"This is another Tana French winner!

My biggest question is: When can we expect Dublin Murder Squad #7?

The first person narrator Antoinette Conway is a 26-year-old rookie African American Murder Squad Detective partnered with Stephen Moran. She's the only woman in Murder Squad and takes more than her share of harassment as a result. But she's tough and often gives as good as she gets, raw language and all.

Her most annoying characteristic is her use of bad grammar in terms of pronoun usage. She constantly says, ""Me and my partner"" when she should say, ""My partner and I."" I have no idea what French thought this error would add to her character.

The victim is Aislinn Murray, 26. Solving her murder is the main plot. Antoinette and Stephen catch this case.

Louis Crowley is a scumbag ""journalist"" starring in a subplot involving him and journalistic ethics.

True to form, French carefully develops her characters along with her plot making this much more than a run-of-the-mill police procedural.

"
"This is easily a top 3 Tana French book and she is among the very best from this genre! Her life-like characters stay with you more than her stories and she creates some great ones in this one. We see Murder detective Antoinette Conway's head taken apart as she and her partner, Stephen Moran, works what starts out as a run-of-the-mill domestic. Conway believes everyone is out there to get her, and not just because she's the only female detective on the squad, but believes she's tough enough to take on the world. Her chemistry with Moran is great though, almost hitting Rob-Cassie heights from In the Woods. Unlike some of the earlier TF novels, the plot took off from the very beginning and unfolded at breakneck pace. Found it really hard to stay away from this one. A fiver to start the year!"
"The Trespasser is an intricately plotted murder mystery told by an unreliable narrator. Antoinette and her partner, Steve, are called to investigate the murder of a young woman. They usually get domestic violence cases, and this one appears to be the same - until it doesn't. The two work through theories involving gangs and old missing person cases while butting heads with another detective who's been assigned to 'mentor' them.
Antoinette, who tells the story and is the only woman on the murder squad, is paranoid and abused by her colleagues. She doesn't trust anyone because of the constant vitriol and pranks that she endures, except maybe Steve, but even that partnership becomes strained as they work the case. It makes her hard to like, especially as the book progresses, but the ending is well worth it.
Tana French does a beautiful job with this series. I admit I don't always get the Irish slang - some I know and some I can pick up from context - which can make reading some of the dialogue challenging, but I still enjoyed the story immensely."
"Four of the six Dublin Murder Squad books are titled based on place. The other two's names are both in the form of The ____, the blank being a concise descriptor of its novel's plot and theme. It's those other two novels that are the stars of the series. (A strong runner-up being #1 Into the Woods, both a place- and theme-based title.)

The Trespasser is a gripping, emotional mystery that collides its protagonist with her own flaws and misjudgments. Perhaps an overly optimistic take on how acknowledging one's oversights can improve one's quality of life, The Trespasser is still a welcome addition in a dark world where sickening perpetrators are not guaranteed justice. I'd also argue it's French's best drawn mystery, though if you love her murder squad, you don't read them for the mind games. She pours just as much of her broken heart over Ireland's 21st century harsh realities into The Trespasser as she does each of her books, and the language is poignant. Inarguably worth a read, and very likely to deliver returns upon rereads."
"Even though I’m not a fan of crime novels, I love Tana French’s books, and The Trespasser is no exception. Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad, and, as relative rookies, they investigate an open and shut case. Of course, “open and shut” do not a novel make; who really did murder the beautiful Aislinn? Layer upon layer, the investigation proceeds, and “China doll Aislinn” has another side, one that is deep and complicated and surprising. Again and again Detective Conway finds and pursues another direction; again and again the answer is elusive. Ever so satisfying, the ending proves that things are never as they seem, at least not in a crime novel. I loved the Irish phrasing and vocabulary, and the brogue of the narrator on the Overdrive audio version took me on a delightful trip. Now, if only I’d seen the Ring of Kerry on this little jaunt. "
"Another excellent mystery by Tana French. She crafts the most fascinating characters and this is no different from her other books in that respect. I loved prickly Antoinette, still hating the ""boys club"" of the Dublin murder squad, and it was actually painful watching the slow deterioration of the relationship between her and Moran because they are both oddballs and we had finally hoped that each had found a place where they ""fit.""

The mystery itself is much more interesting than it seemed at first glance, and the more pressure her co-workers put on Antoinette to finish the ""slam-dunk"" case, the more she fights back, refusing to accept the neat package that has been placed in her lap. She finds the real killer, but it is a slow, painful slog that is at some times fascinating and other times painful to read. A complicated but rewarding read.

If you haven't tried this series yet then you really need to. You won't be disappointed."
"Mmm. My least favorite of this series, but still a darn good read. It took me a while to get into it; I was glad to see more of Detective Conway, glad to see more of Moran, but the mystery itself just didn't do it for me. I was missing the magic of her other books, and I think it makes sense that it wouldn't be here--Conway just isn't the sort of person to let magic creep into her case. And now that I'm thinking about it, the fact that The Secret Place had the most of that supernatural aspect and was also the Moran POV book is--I mean, it's not an accident, which detectives get which cases. Moran loves beauty, of course we'd be 
seeing the witches through his eyes. I shouldn't be surprised--French is freaking masterful, her writing is nothing if not thoughtful.

I love these books. I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this, because it's so good, but it just didn't draw ME in like the other books did. Still better than 90% of the books I read. I'm going 4."
"Spoilers are easy to avoid. Easy enough, anyway, even in our Age of Information. What’s almost impossible to avoid is reputation. Impressions. No matter how many dramas Stephen King writes, for many, he will always be a horror writer (not that this is hurting his bottom line).

I only knew two things about Tana French: she wrote a wildly popular mystery, and her books were always major downers with unsatisfying endings.

Maybe I hopped aboard The Exception Express, but I’m happy to report that this book was amazingly satisfying, with an ending that made me hoop and holler for joy.

I won’t add to the spoiler noise, so let me keep my comments to the generalities: I loved her characters, her mystery, her exceptional use of language, her humor, and I especially loved the voice of the Irish actress who narrated the audio book.

Maybe if I had started with another of her books my opinion would be different, but I cannot recommend this book enough."
"Tana French creates most careful, intricate plots I have ever read; she literally ""spins a web"" and you, the reader, are trapped in it until she chooses to release you. She creates people vibrant enough, real enough, to strike a memory chord within you - as though, surely, you know them from somewhere. She pens the neatest, tightest, turns-of-phrase. Poetry? Maybe, but it's too raw, ugly at times, heartbreaking.
In short, this writer is incredible.
""The Trespasser"" explores the dark side of police work on the Dublin Murder Squad - betrayal and cruelty just the other side of the thin blue line. When Antoinette Conway - tough and toting a chip on her shoulder the size of the island - is handed a bland case of domestic violence gone overboard, she and her partner look to the obvious suspect. Then they look deeper. What they see sheds a frightening light on familiar faces and pushes a sliver of doubt between them.
Okay, no more from me! Read, read, read."
"Many readers have given this book two thumbs up and I won't be any different - - I've been a Tana French fan for a long time and this book, The Trespasser is one of her best. This is a tough as nails story - This is the sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series and if you ever thought about being a police detective, you need to read this book. I could call it a great police procedural, and it is, but it's so much more - The characters are multidimensional - you hear their thoughts as well as their dialogue - - you get to know the main characters, Conway and Moran - the cops trying to solve a murder or is it a murder? You are brought along through the investigation and you'll swear you know who did it - but, then again, maybe they didn't - - - This story takes place in Ireland, but it could be any police force in the world - it's a tough job - both physically and mentally - - Want to read a great book? Well, this is it!"
"This is my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book so far. In a weird way, I think this series has gotten more positive as it goes, I remember feeling distraught and the characters seeming hopeless at the end of the first books of the series. Even though there are still realistically sad endings for some characters in the book including the murder victim, I left this book feeling hopeful and felt like the main characters did as well.I loved the main character of this one. I loved her in the last book in the series and was so happy to see her in the lead role this time. I'm glad her and her partner were always on the same page since the book before this one, even if they don't always get along. I enjoyed the parallels between the victim and the lead detective's lives. The victim was also an interesting character slowly revealed over time, she made it harder to figure out what truly happened."
"Tan French has done it again--a tightly written compelling story that keeps you reading. Every time I thought I had it figured out, there was another twist. And when the detectives solve the mystery, police department problems remain between them and the arrest of a suspect.

At first look the police think the Aislinn Murray was killed in a domestic dispute gone wrong, but then they discover her apartment has been wiped clean--no fingerprints anywhere. The girl herself seems like a replaceable cipher--her clothes are the what everyone else is wearing, her apartment looks to be furnished from a magazine article, her job is a dead end, she has no family and few friends. At first they thin the boyfriend accidentally killed her, but the deeper the detectives dig, the more complicated the case becomes.

The sense of place is, as usual, very strong. These people are very real, and could not be from any place other than Ireland."
" Within the first couple of minutes of listening to the book, all the reasons I love Tana French's books came rushing back. The language in her books is so rich, her descriptions detailed in a way that paint a picture for the reader of a landscape, be it an interior or exterior space. The characters are three-dimensional; their strengths and flaws feel authentic. The different protagonists across the Murder Squad series are each new characters. French's plotting is nuanced and unpredictable. The reader may think she's nailed the murderer early on, but she won't know if she's right - or what the killer's motives were.  This murder involves what first appears to be a date gone bad, or a home invasion. But as the ""Ds"" work the case, its pieces refuse to fall neatly into place. Clues and testimonies can be worked and reworked into a variety of explanations, each one having at least one jarring off-key note . Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Morin have to push back against accepting the facile story urged by the more senior Det. Breslin, all the while wondering why he's so insistent on buttoning things up. Like every story coming out of the Dublin Murder Squad, ""The Trespasser"" is fresh and textured. I only wish there were more such stories to read!"
"What stories do we tell ourselves? How does our perspective get in the way of seeing the truth? How rare is it for someone to truly have our back? Another great Dublin Murder Squad tale. This one is from the perspective of tough detective Antoinette Conway. She is now partnered with Stephen Moran, bringing him into Murder after he helped her solve the last case. This time it all hits closer to home in more ways than either of them want to acknowledge. I loved the ups and downs of this book. I wanted to break out of Antoinette's perspective in the story, but that is how it is in life. We can only see things as our background and experiences allow us to. Having a partner, someone you can trust to challenge your point of view, is critical to moving through challenging circumstances. Very exciting conclusion to the story.

Characters:
Antoinette Conway
Stephen Moran
Asilinn Murray
Detective's Roche, Breslin, McCann
Squad Leader O'Kelly"
"Wow, wow and wow! This is two for two now of French’s Murder Squad series and I am ready for more. I read The Searcher first, and it hit me so hard I couldn’t imagine she could do it to me again. But she has. I mean move me and impress me and create characters that are so real and full and dialogue that is brilliant. And plots that go in so many directions that you are lost, then You find the right path and then you get lost again. You think you have it solved now and the last word has been said, but it hasn’t. How can there be so many more pages—what’s going to happen?

Never dull, never a moment of calm, many feelings of emotion, sadness for the characters, even the ones you don’t want to feel for. I don’t know how French does this dance, but she is expert at it. I am so awed by her writing that my mouth hangs open in admiration.

Read anything by her, in order or not. You will never be wasting your time."
"I wish I could give Tana French’s books more than five stars. Police procedurals have never really been my thing, until I found out that they could be written like this. Just proves that no matter what the topic or genre is, a brilliantly-written book is a pleasure to read. I lingered over every sentence of The Trespasser because the dialogue is so real, the narrator’s thoughts are so achingly authentic, and the plot is so messy and complicated, just like real life. No word is wasted in this book. I never once thought she could have chosen a different word or phrase. If I didn’t appreciate the full import of a sentence the first time I read it, I read it again, only to be “gobsmacked” by what it was really saying. It is a book about real civilians and real detectives, all three-dimensional and deeply flawed, not one of them hastily conceived. If only every book I read in every genre were this great. Thank you, Tana French."
"French creates real characters, some of whom you'll love and others you'll want to punch in the throat. Conway & Moran investigate the murder, while McGann, Breslin, (the Murder Ds), Lucy and Rory (friends of the 'vic' Aislynn), and Crowley (the ""journalist"") each take a turn as the potential murderer as the story evolves. The Irish-isms and rough locker-room language keep it real as Conway & Moran brainstorm to make sense of the evidence while swatting down puerile antics of their co-workers. Dialogue among the Ds and the interviewees is sharp and leads the reader down a potential trail or two or three. Conway's internal dialogue takes us on a roller coaster of confidence and insecurity. The ending is quite satisfying! And I'm sure that these characters invaded my dreams one night. They are that real.
Now that I know this is #6 in the Dublin Murder Squad Series, I will probably go back to where the series began with In the Woods."
"Detective Antoinette Conway in Tana French's ""The Trespasser,"" is a tough cop. That toughness serves her well as the only black woman and youngest lead detective on the all-white, all-male Dublin Murder Squad. Conway grew up with a birth certificate listing her father as ""unknown,” while her mother fed her pretty stories of the missing ""da"" as an Arab prince or an Egyptian medical student. Having outgrown her mum's fairy tales, Detective Conway feels nothing but scorn for the victim of her latest murder case who devoted her life to finding her missing father.

""The Trespasser"" is a roller-coaster ride that kept me sleepless till the end of the novel. Detective Conway exudes a steely strength in a world of paranoia and menace. French's descriptions are vivid and put the reader into the scene as well as into the mind of the protagonist, and even minor characters are as large as life.

This is my first foray into Tana French's oeuvre, but it will not be my last."
"Antoinette Conway knows her place on her squad; as the only woman, she faces a lot of grief every day that she goes in to work. Most days, Conway keeps her head down, focuses on her work, and depends on her partner to help her through.

A seemingly simple domestic violence murder changes everything though. From the outside, Aislinn Murray seems like pretty uncomplicated. She's beautiful, keeps her house immaculate, and has a dorky boyfriend. Who would want to kill her? From the moment that she is assigned the case, Conway has a feeling that there might be something more to it than what appears from the outside.

Will she be able to unravel things before it's too late?

I really really love this series. I love how French continues the series, but uses a different narrator each time. It keeps the series fresh, and always leaves me guessing who will be the next narrator. I highly recommend this series to readers that enjoy a suspenseful and dark mystery."
"Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran have been working Dublin Murder Squad for a while but not yet long enough to get the really interesting cases. Conway, being female, gets pushed around a lot but Moran treats her well and defends her and she fights back valiantly. However whereas they have to be adversarial with the criminals there is a lot of infighting and malicious slander among their colleagues making the job more difficult with a lot of effort devoted to protecting each other’s backs. A young woman has been killed in her apartment with minimal clues, and obstructive friends who may have competing motives. As the case develops they feel like they are being set up by persons unknown but possibly from within their own squad. This is an excellent mystery with well-developed characters. I liked it a lot.

"4.5
Was so excited when reading the previous book that Antoinette Conway seemed like she was going to be the next protagonist--and she was! What I liked was that in the previous book, we came to like her more and more--and in this book, despite being in her head, she always had a wall up. (Usually, it's the other way around; the protagonist in the previous book dislikes the next protagonist, and we come to like the protagonist in their own book.) I love how Tana French can always get in such different characters' heads. The book did drag for me a bit in some parts, and it wasn't my favorite of Tana French's books, but I still really liked it. Plus, I thought from the beginning that I had it figured out, and I was close--but hadn't quite gotten the final twist. So I liked that there were surprises in there."
"2020 review: I've read this three or four times, but every time, it feels like the first time. I went on for a few glowing paragraphs in an email to someone when I first did read it, and could've sworn I put it on here. So, I did not. Okay. I have an enormous crush on Conway. If she were a real person, she would undoubtedly be annoyed by that. This was the first book of the series I read, and it was recommended by a BookTuber who doesn't read a lot of mysteries. She read it as part of a reading challenge, and pointed out the diversity in this book. Antoinette Conway points it out, too, immediately. In a prologue that actually makes -sense- and actually fits in with the whole book, and is even linked to a big event!! I despise prologues and find them utterly pointless and padding 99.9% of the time. This was the one big exception. I read it every time I read the book. Right off, we are told Conway, as she's referred to throughout the book, is mixed-race, and in particular has a biological father of Middle Eastern descent who was never part of the picture. We are shown that Conway is inquisitive, stubborn, can be willful, but can also believe in unlikely things sometimes. And that she loves her mom, but questions her and has pretty good boundaries. These things are shown again and again throughout the whole book in different ways for different reasons, and I -adored- it when I figured out what was going on. This is also used incredibly skillfully to make Conway a foil to Aislinn, the murdered woman.

Aislinn reminded me of me for different reasons in different ways, and I laughed the third time I read the book, when Conway described how they had actually met. It wasn't funny. I laughed because here I am with this huge crush, and if I were in Aislinn's situation I'd do exactly that, right down to ""you don't understand!"" and Conway would dismiss me, too. I was laughing at myself, not Aislinn. To say nothing of Rory, the poor nervous wreck. Part of me in him, definitely, too. But he's a stalker, and I was so weirded out. Tana French writes really convincing characters.

The dynamic between Conway and Moran is my -faaaaavorite- in cop fiction so far. I just want to dance a little when I'm reading them, but it's a long book so I don't. I have to admit, the line ""Conwaaaay, I am your faaaather,"" has me dying laughing every single time. Why and how they argue--so realistic. So good. I almost cried the first time because I didn't -want- them to leave and get new partners and stuff. I was -not- a fan of the other men and kind of resented how well Conway worked with them, then pushed my feelings aside because it was police interrogation stuff, not my time to feel cheated out of what is basically a platonic OTP. I am so thrilled to even have a platonic OTP and that they can exist and I can be happy. Like, it's their job, I remind myself. It's their job to interrogate people and throw out ideas and doesn't need to just be restricted to the only two cops worth reading about. I have um, tried to read other books in the series besides ""Secret Place"" and uh, got really irritated. Severe lack of Conway equals severe lack of interest. Moran is terrific, and oh, I tried to read the other book he was in with Mackey, I think it was. There were times in this book and ""Secret Place"" when I wanted to hug Moran. He is a terrific foil for Conway. The book would be much less interesting without him. Such a great balance. He needs things to be beautiful, and Conway has never had any choice in the world except to see things as they are.

Sophie and Fleas need their own books with Conway omg. But also I would be happy to just write fanfic. Every time Fleas jumps on the page (haha pun), I want to shout in glee and grab a pencil and paper. Sophie just has me grinning, too. Strong female cop friendships! What a delight. Of course I want more. And wow, does Tana French know how to write subtle UST via Fleas/Conway. Someday I might try writing fanfic to get my ideas out of my system.

When I read this book the first time, I was going through things at my then-job (totally different field, though) that were so similar to Conway's experiences that my stomach was incredibly sour and my chest was tight. I clenched my jaw a lot as I read, and lived vicariously through her in my mind. I left that job after four months. The second read, I sighed in relief at the ending. I knew how it would go, but I needed it to be the same. That sounded a lot less weird in my head. I get invested in this book and how it ends, and every step in between, every time. The third read, I laughed as I checked out the book from the library again. I was so eager to dive into the story and experience it once more. My jaw wasn't clenched, my stomach wasn't sour, my chest wasn't tight. I still cheered Conway and Moran, and hissed at their workplace and circumstances, and delighted in the ending. And I checked, suddenly, to figure out just how fast this whole thing happens. This is such a rich, detailed character study that it takes place over--for some reason I think it's a week, maybe even less. I just had to sit for a minute once I figured out that a lot happens in a short amount of time, in this novel.

The fourth read, the most recent this time, I relished in the details, the description, the plot, and especially the ending page. I still have a huge crush on Conway. When I saw news that this might become a tv series, I squealed really loud, alone in my apartment. I want to see if my images of Conway and Moran match up! I found someone's fan-cast, and damn, that person thinks just the way I do. Like, there's Irish and British actors out there who look just how I imagine Conway and Moran to, and it was exciting to discover. I'm so glad for Tana French's success, and I hope it continues. I'm so glad I get to read and reread such a great story."
"Couldnt put it down

I have only 2 criticisms of Tana French. Firstly, she is responsible for me showing up in work bleary-eyed and exhausted and spending the day wondering if I can sneak a few pages when no ones looking. And secondly, she doesn't seem to be able too write a book as quickly as I can read them which means I now have to root around looking for another one that might hold me in the same way.
I'm originally from Dublin so the places and characters and dialogue are completely real to me. I thought this story was excellent but more than that, seeing the world from Antoinette's perspective, with all its shadows and light, make this my favorite Tana French book yet. I just hope she is hammering the shit out a keyboard somewhere so we won't have to tread water too long before the next installment"
"This is the author's sixth book in the series, which don't get published often enough for me. For me this book didn't have quite the impact of mood and setting that I got from the previous five. In fact I found myself feeling like it was getting a bit formulaic, esp. the way the characters were continually developing and discarding scenarios. No spoilers, but the last chapter is worth any misgivings about the rest of the book. How many times do you feel like crying at the end of a who-dun-it? Relieved, yes. Sorrow and admiration for the characters at the end? Pretty rare. The sheer depth of characterization just left me a bit stunned, esp. the way it prodded the plot and how the plot affected the characters and their understandings of each other.

Now, how long do I have to wait for the next one?... When they're this well crafted, it's worth the wait."
"A real page turner! French uses a different narrator for each novel, and I'm gobsmacked at how easily she can morph into one or another. The narrators are all member os the Dublin Murder Squad.
I Like this one much better than the preceding one; it is one of her best after Into the Woods, Faithful Place, and The Secret Place.
The narrator is a newish voice to this series, a female on the Murder Squad, bringing her issues and insecurities with her. I really liked her character--a fighter, and smart, but bedeviled is some ways.

Descriptions, as usual are great, and the plot is compelling, but it is the characters that she brings to life--and the dialogue seems spot on. I lent it to a friend, and I might have to reread it. Highly recommend for crime/detective fiction readers--more than genre fiction; it is a novel with a murder at the center."
"Just finished listening to The Trespasser. This is the first time I have listened to one of Tana French's works and I found the Irish accent hard to follow at times, although I did get used to it. Like her other titles in this series, this work kept my interest. I think I might prefer to actually read her works in the future. I was surprisingly offended at times by the crudeness of the language, and questioned if I would have had the same reaction if I was reading it instead of listening to it. Perhaps Americans are too puritanical after all. ( Or I am... sad to say). I thought the storyline was well developed, and the police work was interesting. I would highly recommend it. I think this might be the second title by French I have read this year and I find her writing hard to put down. "
"I am a sucker for these detective stories set in Dublin. While some of the slang baffles me, I can usually figure it out in context. Tana French gets better each time I read her latest book. This one is about the politics of the Police as well as the murder of a lovely young woman whose father had left the family years before. Both Antoinette and Steve, the detectives from the Murder Dept., do their best to interview those connected and put together the story of the murder. What is most intriguing is the interplay between the detectives and the other people in the department. While this is a murder investigation, the real story is in the Police Department. Anyone who has been to the Castle in Dublin or walked along the Liffey will enjoy being back in Dublin and solving the mystery with these A-1 detectives. "
"I try to be conservative with my five star ratings . . . so this may really be a 4.75. But I found this book thoroughly fascinating and satisfying. Antoinette Conway is the only female member of the Dublin-based Murder Squad, and as such she is harassed and feels excluded. She and her partner Stephen Moran are handed a case that initially seems to be a basic case of domestic abuse . . . but proves to have a deeper side. The story is a fine policy mystery, but what makes the book a fascination is the portrayal of Conway, her thinking, her way of viewing the world. Excellent writing, wonderful turn of phrase is what seems a natural way. I listened to the book and found it to be wonderfully read. Surely the Irish brogue added a depth of character to the story. I'll definitely be reading other books by Tana French.
"
"The thing i love about TF novels (and this was no exception) they charachters' choices are based on self awareness and utmost integrity. They provide razor sharp descriptions of how charachters are thinking and feeling at every juncture, calling out, at times unsavory, human behavior that we all pretend to hide.The thing i don't love about TF novels (and this was no exception): they are about 100 pages too long. The overlapping red herrings that take long windy twisty turns, end at a dead end that is as hair pulling as trying to navigate a corn maze in the rain, and then it usually turns out being who you first suspected anyway and it feels like we, as readers, should be thrown clues to this much sooner than we get them.Regardless, this book like her others was unputtdownable and riveting start to finish and i respect the voice she gives her gritty noir detectives"
"Even though this is Book 6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series, it was my introduction to Tana French. And what an introduction!

French writes with a remarkable style that take the reader into the world of the Dublin Murder Squad and the lives of its detectives. This story starts with what appears to be a basic domestic situation that went bad, and the obvious suspect for the death of a young woman is the rather odd man who was pursuing her. The case seems simple, so Antoinette Conway, the only woman in the squad, is assigned to touch the routine bases and arrest the would-be boyfriend.

But Antoinette doesn't see the case quite so simply. From there, she takes off on an investigation that leads her into the very heart of the Murder Squad itself. Anyone who enjoys police procedurals or intriguing characters needs to put this book on their MUST READ list"
"Talk about ending the decade with a bang! Gritty, complex and splendid. The Trespasser is 100% crime fiction, but there's so many trust issues between all the characters in this book that it could almost pass as a spy thriller. I'm not familiar with French's writing process, but imagine the plotting for a novel this multi-layered would cover a room full of whiteboards. It's masterful. Super glad I read this at the end of the year when I had a little more free time on my hands and could read this fairly uninterrupted.

Didn't see this in list of Goodreads questions, but I'm not 100 certain on the meaning behind the title. Does it refer to the murderer? Or perhaps to Detective Conway as sort of a reflection on how she views herself as a member of the Murder Squad? Or am I just missing something terribly obvious?"
"The last book I read was also a Tana French (The Witch Elm) and I thought it was the best of her books I've read. No, The Trespasser is. Hands down. In all French's books, the murder is the plot thread that pulls you though the book, but it's her uncanny grasp of the characters' flaws, internal dialogues, speech patterns, and mannerisms that are the story and what bowl me over. The books are always written in such a way that you not only hear the characters' spoken words and inner thoughts, French weaves through the tiny details that make you see their body language, the set, the feeling of the place (via all five senses), and the physical impact those have on the characters. That's what sets a brilliantly written book apart from those that are just ""good"". The stories themselves are always mesmerizing. I am just wowed by French's talent. "
"The first book by Tana French I've read, it is the second written in present tense I've had occasion to try lately. Where the first was a challenge, this novel was less so given its rapid pacing and shifting plot line. Antoinette Conway has landed her dream position as a detective on Dublin's Murder Squad only to bear the brunt of her male counterpart's animosity. Her preoccupation with what has gone far beyond hazing, leads her to sense conspiracy and complication in the case she and partner Stephen Moran have taken on. Conway allows a bit of paranoia to influence her actions and discovers she was indeed being manipulated but not for the reasons she thought.

Other than a bit of dialogue, the Murder Squad could have been set in Dublin, Ohio. Even so, I'm looking forward to reading another by this author."
"Deeper than your average thriller, but just as thrilling!

The plot is brilliantly constructed. The police work feels believable. And the story itself is as suspenseful and engaging as Scorsese’s “The Departed.”
The main character has a strange, flickering quality. Half the time I pictured her as described in the story: mixed race, tall, and athletic. But at other points I pictured her differently
—more like the author’s headshot (no idea about author’s height). I found this effect interesting. It’s not that the character wasn’t believable, she was totally believable. But often an author like to hide (even disappear) within their character’s physicality, and that didn’t happen here. The author often peaked out of the character and looked right at the reader. For me, it made the book more engaging and exciting."
"Ah Tana French brought it all back for me in this installment of the Dublin Murder Squad series. I wasn’t a huge fan of Broken Harbor, and while I didn’t enjoy Stephen Moran and Conway in The Secret Place, that one just didn’t feel like a DMS book because of the split narrative with the school girls.

Antoinette Conway’s voice in The Trespasser was brash, strong, and analytic, both of the case and of her own life. I loved her personal journey throughout and how she confronted herself and her own preconceived notions by the end of the book. I also loved the story and how it unfolded — great pacing throughout for the most part (only one slow bit imo) and I loved how the case kept evolving and getting turned on its head. A great finale to the series if French doesn’t return, but o hope she will!"
"There's nothing not to like about a Tana French novel. Ever.

With each novel, French's plots bring something fresh and yet familiar. The characters are new but the protagonist probably played a role somewhere in a previous book. In THE TRESPASSER, Antoinette Conway is plunged into a case that not only draws intrigue from a mysterious killer but also the darkness of her own squad.

An interesting job doesn't bring the best of teams (no kidding) and it takes all of Antoinette's brains and attitude to deal with it. Partnering with Stephen Moran the duo fight crime within and without the force and the reader is drawn into the book on so many levels.

Another 5 star novel from the queen of 21st century crime!"
"The hook was deeply set when I read the first paragraph of the very first Tana French novel several years ago and she hasn't lost her touch. My only regret is that it takes so long to craft such carefully and beautifully written mysteries - but they continue to be very worth the wait. Each book is different from the others even as her cast of characters move in and out of frame from book to book. The only other author I've ever read who was capable of working so well with a changing cast of regular characters as leads but all set in the same venue was Ed McBain - and as much as I enjoy his books I think Tana French's writing superior. But perhaps it's just the touch of Ireland that her books convey. In any case, I'll now resume my patient wait for the next one!! "
"4.5 stars. A highly satisfying Dublin Murder Squad. This series is loosely connected, with the main character changing every time, but this time both detectives, Conway and Moran, at least have stayed the same from the previous book, but now we're in Conway's head along with the giant chip she's carrying around for being the odd woman in the boys' club of murder squad. This time the two have a case they don't like the face value of, and we go on a bumpy hunt for answers. It's a masterful character driven and police procedural novel. The pace did at one point start to slow just a bit for me, but honestly, when you're so ready for a solve and the stupid case is stalling and yada yada drama, of course the anticipation leaves you wanting more *now.* "
"I hadn't read a mystery book in a while and I got my fix with this book. Then I find out that this is the 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, so I just added 5 more books to my reading list. The story starts somewhat slow, or maybe it was me as a dumb American who didn't understand some of the Irish jargon. It is basically a ""whodunit"" murder mystery. After I go used to the flow of the book (I imagined everyone sounding like Lucky the Leprechaun), I could not put this book down. Once you pass the first chapter, it becomes a fast-paced, unpredictable, thought-provoking read. It starts with a dead girl, Detectives Conway and Moran set to find out how/why, then BOOM! Mind blown! Five star rating! Go read this book."
"Police procedural (most than most), crime fiction. A woman -- dressed up, made up, ""blond hair, straightened and sprayed so ferociously that even murder hasn't managed to mess it up .... [s]he looks like Dead Barbie"" -- is found dead in her home, obviously interrupted while preparing a cozy dinner for two there.  Antoinette Conway, fairly new to the Murder Squad but already made wary and cynical by harsh hazing/sabotage, and her ready-to-please partner Steve Moran are given what looks like a simple domestic violence case. Excellent plot -- much of it involving police work, suspect interviews, the delicate dealings within the team -- with complex and interesting characters and relationships. Page-turner. Recommended."
"This book by Tana French probably ranks as my second favorite of all her books (after In The Woods). The voice and character of Antoinette Conway, a tough detective who's slowly having her will to survive on the Murder Squad eaten away by what she's convinced is the group decision to never accept her, was an absolute pleasure to experience - and Conway and Moran may just be my favorite all-time detective duo (I would be happy if French just stuck with them and alternated perspective between books from now on - but that probably won't happen). As a side note, it wasn't obvious to me who the killer was, although I can understand why some readers could figure it out.

I hope French keeps writing these Dublin Murder Squad books for a very long time."
"Review also available at: https://devinhurd.herokuapp.com/singl...

Tana French makes writing dark police procedurals with plot twists look easy. And yet it's only after the final page that the full structure and blistering character arcs become clear. In the case of THE TRESPASSER we're led to believe - along with our protagonist - that this is a murder case with overtones of corruption and/or organized crime involvement. But the reality is that several pieces are carefully being set up for two fantastic interview sequences at the tail end of this novel. Each of the five stars were earned on the strength and unexpected satisfaction of those two scenes. Few writers would have crossed that finish line with the dark tone still intact. This one was a great thrill ride."
"This was my favorite of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, and I hope she continues to write more of this quality.

The Trespasser continues with the partnership of Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran, who first teemed up in The Secret Place, and is told from Conway's point of view. After a long overnight shift, they are called upon to investigate the murder of Aislinn Murray, a pretty, blond young woman found in her picture perfect apartment. Unfortunately, they are teamed up with the slimy and condescending Detective Breslin, about whom Conway has her suspicions. At the same time, Conway is dealing with constant harassment from her squad, and considers quitting.

I won't give any more away, but there were some surprises here, and I was kept riveted until the end."
"Literally couldn't put down this audiobook that put me right back into Dublin. The weather, the accents, the atmosphere seemed spot on, reminding me of my 14 years living in Dublin, attending Kings Inns, UCD, and working at The Four Courts. Kudos too to Hilda Fay's superb narration. Although published in the autumn of 2016, this novel could also have been the product of the ""me-too"" movement, as it memorializes the difficulties of being the only woman detective on the Dublin murder squad. It isn't a triller, per se, but it is thrilling. The characters and locations leap off the page so vividly, it is easy to understand why the BBC has chosen to televise some of French's work, and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing it."
"I just happened across this book on Overdrive through my public library and very glad I did! Readers of Louise Penny's books will probably also enjoy this author. I didn't even know this was part of a series and look forward to reading the other titles. The story takes place in Dublin, on the local murder squad. Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are given a case that appears to be a clear crime of passion and are being pressured by one of their more experienced colleagues to charge the boyfriend with the murder of local beauty, Aislinn. However, they have doubts and they take the reader along for the ride, with many different plot twists and turns. Very compelling - I couldn't put it down until the shocking end."
"Long ago I read In The Woods and was so angry at the “non-ending” after such a huge suspenseful build-up that I swore off this author forever, but time has a way of tampering down disappointment, so when my library app recommended The Trespasser, I borrowed it and and I’m so glad I did.

I loved this book! I got the audio version so I’m sure the narrator had a lot to do with how much I enjoyed it (she was brilliant!), but also the story was key, too. I loved Antoinette and Steve. I hope there are more books with them. The mystery was excellent,and hey—there’s a satisfying ending so all’s good. 😀 Now I’m off to see what other Tana French books I can find and hope they are as good as this one."
"- love the descriptive language, feels like Neil Gaiman prose mix with fancy literature & metaphors. Simply brilliant. Some of the best vivid images I've read.
- characters: love Steve & Fleas; Antoinette, not so much but she grew on me; Antoinette is very cynical in general & the person she is is pretty clearly stated in the story (paranoid? maybe. think the world is getting to her? also maybe). Love how all the characters become very real, if not immediately then in the end.
- plot lags a little bit in some places but the narrative keeps my attention. Didn't really like the interrogation scenes with Ant. & Breslin but the conversation between Ant. & Lucy is awesome. Last part becomes very emotional.
- fun read all in all. 4.5/5"
"And Tana French adds another fantastic work to her list. This one, I had no idea where it was going and it kept me turning pages even when I was frustrated by the general lack of evidence in the case. Antoinette Conway was more difficult to like than in the last book where she wasn't the narrator, and there were many times I wanted to shake her, but the way things came together in the end, not just for the case but for her mental state as well, was incredibly satisfying. Possibly one of my favorites works of French's because I was guessing the whole time and wasn't slagging on the detectives in my head for not seeing what I was seeing. I will probably read as many of this series as she decides to publish because I just love how well she writes. "
"Possibly one of the best books I’ve ever read. Funny that I am saying that, since it was really hard for me to get through the first third of the book. I disliked the protagonist Antoinette Conway so much. But Tana French is good at unraveling the threads of her stories; by the last third of the book I understood why Conway was the way she is and saw her changing. This book shows the power of police interrogations to call out stories and to determine innocence or guilt—sometimes to the point of basically assigning guilt. Some passages are so beautifully written, I kept flipping back to read them. In particular, Conway’s descriptions of the first case meeting and of how it feels to close in on a suspect are stunning. "
"Tana French's work is fantastic. (With one, sad, exception The Witch Elm - which didn't hold my attention long enough for me to finish it). Her prose is excellent and she keeps you turning the pages, but I think what I love most is her flawed, human characters. They keep me coming back despite the fact that her plot twists and devices often stretch the bounds of credulity. Even when I see the ending coming, I don't mind, because I'm in it for the characters and their growth.

Like her other Dublin Murder Squad mysteries, this one is gritty: plenty of profanity, violence, and exposure to the darker sides of human nature.

Having read all six, I'd rate them, in order from best to worse: The Trespasser, The Likeness, Faithful Place, In the Woods, The Secret Place, and Broken Harbor."
"A really, really good ending to the series. Tana French is joining Michael Robotham and Steven James among my top thriller authors. I loved everything she wrote. I've read every single one of her 7 books in the course of a few months. Her characters are always spot-on and sympathetic, her plots are brilliant, and her settings are pure Ireland. I loved getting inside Conway's head in this one, and the relationship between Moran and Conway was one of the best I've ever read. It was so real and raw. And everything I thought I knew about the victim, EVERYTHING, was wrong. I love how French can twist everything into a messy-looking knot, and then so beautifully unravel it. She really is one of the best thriller writers, in my opinion, and I can't wait to see what she comes out with next!"
"OOwweeee! This was one hell of a roller-coaster ride. I read it in great chunks. Excellent as always. As usual, more than just a mystery, more than 2 mysteries. Politics in the workplace is a terrible thing, but brilliantly described here.A few questions: was Antoinette half-black, half-Indian or what? And was that really her father who showed up or a plant to mindfuck her? Are the Irish so in love with profanity? Are the Irish really so casual about sex? And is Dublin really such a cesspool of violence, drunkenness and drugs?You can feel the adrenaline coursing through you as you follow Antoinette and her partner thru the investigation. And I'm very happy that an innocent man did not go to jail."
"So many of the current police/detective novels are formulaic tales of a particular personality--developed over a series of books and honed to predictability. Not so The Trespasser. While the book is told in the first person from the eyes of a woman detective on the Dublin murder squad, about 1/3 of the book is compelling internal monologue. As the plot takes its twists and turns, and there are many, we get to experience it through the mind of the protagonist, to great effect. I won't even mention the content of the plot as it is almost secondary to the excellent character development. This is one hell of a well written book and I can't recommend it highly enough. You'll be sorry that's it's over when you're done."
"Not French's most mysterious murder, but The Trespasser features a fascinating cast of characters whose friendships and enmities are both complex and believable. The main character, Antoinette, is one of my favorite in the entire Murder Squad series, and the novel's surprising resolution comes is thoroughly satisfying.

My only critique is that the novel is more of a meta-critique, and has to do with how police procedurals shape public opinion of cops. Ultimately, The Trespasser gives police departments too much credit. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but, given what the world now knows about policing, Antoinette's stress and social paranoia are, unfortunately, very well backed up by the facts about racism, misogyny and white supremacy on the force.


"
"I wasn’t as excited to read this book as I have been for the rest of the series because Conway wasn’t a character I particularly liked after the last book. But wow did she grow on me. When I finish reading this book, I said to myself wow I just loved that book. She had so much growth as a character, and I really appreciate how honest she was with herself about the things that she had thought or assumed and what was actually happening. It felt like she really grew up in this book. The mystery was interesting as always, but it’s the character development that keeps me coming back to Tana French his books. This one hit that spot on. Possibly my favorite in the series or at least tied with Faithful Place."
"What a way to end the series! (Although, I hope it continues). Honestly, if this is for sure the last book, I'd hoped there would be some fanfair-payoffs with a cameo or references to some of the characters in the earlier books; Rob, Cassie, Sam, Frank, Rookie Richie or Scorcher. I was also a little disapointed when I realized Conway was going to be the lead, because she seems the most cliche' of the the Ds. Those are my only critical comments, which are totally subjective, otherwise the story was enganging and interesting. After reading books 1-6, it's hard to pick my ultimate favorite, but this certainly a contender, but I think I have enjoyed the series as a whole more than any one story. "
"This was the fifth Tana French mystery I have been spellbound by. This one was hard going because the topics reflected negative aspects of reality. And each significant minute of the case struggle was covered. No escapist fun in this story. So the plot is contrived and the bad guys were perhaps exaggerated but this is fiction. What is not contrived in French’s novels is the psychological portraits and person interaction that brings each of her stories to life. I listen to all her books and it brings them even more alive. On the other hand, I can the characters coming to life from the page.

The TV series is not available in my area but I look forward to seeing it someday. I wonder if the depth of characterization in the screenplay equals that on the page."
"Another stellar Dublin Murder Squad book! What I like best about Tana French's detective mysteries is the attention she pays to the psychology of the characters. The motives of the killers in her books are realistic and in-depth, the detectives are drawn as human beings with dimension, and the rest of the characters are integral to the story (no throwaway red herring characters). Her stories are always intense. I find myself unable to put down her novels once I've started. French makes the resolution of the crime come upon you gradually - no dumping of the solution out of nowhere - and you're left feeling like it makes sense. The only bad thing is that I have now read all her books to date and now I'm sad."
"Tana French is one of the best contemporary crime writers, and this series is superb. But this one was perfection, for me. Spiky, working-class, and the only woman in the squad room, Antoinette Conway has a whole bag of chips on her shoulder. And with good reason. In this book, she even starts to mistrust her ambitious partner Stephen (the star of book 5) at times. They're investigating what at first appeared to be a routine domestic murder – but turns into something far more complex. French is such a brilliant writer that she can over-write at times, but in this one the pacing, the psychology – all seem spot-on. I'm bereft that this seems to be the last in the series. I hope she changes her mind!"
"This is really clever crime fiction. The whole plot comes across as very believable actions by normal people who have just strayed a bit far over the line. It is a classic police procedural (except they never do turn up physical evidence). Young woman killed, almost certainly unintentionally, but no-one there to explain how or why. The story comes through Antoinette (partner Steve) and they are the 'outsiders' in the team, she even more so as the only woman and only non white. Outsiders and what being one results in, being a theme through the whole story. I think Antoinette's growing enlightenment is as interesting a thread as the murder itself, but either way the whole is very compelling through both events and relationships."
"The New Yorker review of The Trespasser claims, ""Most crime fiction is diverting; French’s is consuming."" Too true! I couldn't put this down and read it in two days. What I love about French's novels, at least the Dublin murder squad ones, is that the detective and the mystery unravel each other. And that happens here with Conway, but that doesn't mean the plot is repetitive--French's characters are too complex and mysteries too innovative for that to happen. The pacing was good too, making this one of my favorites. 
And if this is French's last Dublin murder squad novel, then I can't help but see how Stephen and Conway's partnership in books 5 & 6 offers a satisfying closed parenthesis to Rob and Cassie's from books 1 & 2."
"I'm supposed to be reading middle grade novels because that's what I'm writing, but I was listening to a podcast and the woman on it said that this book, The Trespasser, was ""getting her through."" So, I ordered it from my lovely local library and began reading it.

Wow. This gritty detective novel is a real treat to read. I often read thrillers and I think the plots are really good, but the writing is a little clique or hackneyed. However, with Tara French, the writing is beautiful. Her descriptions are so fresh and unique. I really enjoyed this.

I will say this is a pretty meaty book: 449 pages. There are lots of twists in the book and the ending is unexpected yet satisfying.

I would pair this book with a nice cup of Irish black tea and some biscuits. Enjoy!"
"I love Detevtives Conway and Moran so much. I was so happy that French decided to give me another look at the partnership between those two. 
I loved the mind games with Breslin. He really had me convinced for one second that all his suspicious behavior was in Conway's head. I loved seeing Coneay and Moran get in a fight over why Conway always makes everything so difficult, but come out of it okay. And I loved the ending as well, with Conway realizing she'd been a bit overly paranoid, even though she clearly had reason to be.

I listened to the audiobook narrated by Hilda Fay. Her voice kind of grated on me, but I can't claim she actually did a bad job, and I got used to the voice by the end."
"Addicted to Tana French. Reading The Trespassers and The Secret Place back-to-back was perfect because it really let French flex her character writing. Secret Place was super lush and dreamy, fitting perfectly into Steve's POV of always finding beauty in the world and wanting to spin stories. The Trespassers, however, has Conway at the helm, so we get a much darker and grittier story.

The mystery in this one didn't grab me as fully but I loved getting more focus on the squad room itself and Conway's personality - French knocked it out of the park writing a more spiky protagonist that I loved to read about.

Devasted there's no more Murder Squad to read. Tana French, if you read this, pease give me another one. PLEASE!"
"Genre: Criminal novel/ fiction
Rating: 4.5/5 stars

“The Trespasser” is an intricate criminal novel turned mystery thriller with a murder victim, dirty cops and a spiderweb of lies and secrets. The victim is a young woman Aislinn which has been found dead in her apartment while clearly waiting for someone for dinner. The cops assigned to solve the case are a duo of detectives (man and woman) who question absolutely everything from the moment they get this murder assigned to them. Since things get suspicious from the bat, there were bound to be lots of interesting things revealed. I personally did not see the plot twist coming even if something felt off and shady from the get-go. Shocking factor plays an important role in a murder mystery and shocked I was! A very interesting story, definitely recommend!"
"Yet another fantastic novel from Tana French. Every time I read one of her books, I’m reminded why she’s one of my favorite (if not my most favorite) authors.

This book was unputdownable. I was always thinking about it, and every time I picked it up I forgot about everything else in my life. Forgot to eat, forgot to breathe half the time.

I loved Conway’s POV even more than I loved her as Steve’s partner in The Secret Place. It was great to have another story with the two of them!

I’ll also say that the ending was more of a happy one than other French books.

One of the blurbs calls this book “consuming.” I would tweak slightly to call it, “utterly consuming.”

Can’t wait to dive into the rest of her novels!"
"A young woman is found murdered after police receive an anonymous call saying a woman required medical help. That could be a fairly typical start to a police procedural, but there is nothing typical about a Tana French novel. Her character development, the plotting, the setting are all so detailed that you are immersed in the world she has constructed. You can taste the thickness of the claustrophobia in the interrogation room as the police officers slowly encircle suspects, tightening the noose. The Trespasser is filled with raw conversations, paranoia, and sweat. Tana French is the top of her class."
"Tana French is so reliably wonderful. As usual, the life of the narrating detective is as compelling as the central murder case; this narrator, Antoinette Conway, is navigating sexism, condescension, and possibly even sabotage from within her own workplace, and French makes us feel the difficulty of sorting out real threats from imagined ones, especially when nerves have been frayed and confidence undermined. As the women in this book work to subvert male power structures, sometimes successfully, sometimes perilously, French makes a case for both the necessity of such changes and the bravery of those who undertake them."
"Tana French has done it again....another fast paced, intriguing book with complex characters, tight plots, and plenty of twists and turns. In this new book in the series of Dublin Ireland murder squad, the two detectives, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, are thrown into a murder investigation of a young woman in her Dublin home. There appears to be no evidence, no witnesses, and Conway is a tough young woman detective with a massive chip on her shoulder. As usual, the author gets inside the heads of her investigators and leads the story quickly to an unexpected ending. I always look forward to books by Tana French, and this one did not disappoint."
"Excellent audio version of this suspenseful novel! 18 CDs flew by!
Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran return, as partners this time in The Murder Squad. As the newbies, they get night shift and the crappy slam dunk cases, until one morning, they get a case where a beautiful girl was killed the night before...
The other murder detectives have not accepted Conway, and in between investigating this ""domestic""
we learn how many dirty tricks have been played on her. Enter Breslin, the star of the murder squad, who wants the case wrapped up quickly with the obvious person of interest. Conway is a quick witted and thin skinned narrator. Tana French is extremely talented."
"Author Tana French spins a multi-layered plot in this tale about Dublin Detective Antoinette Conway, as she and her partner investigate the murder of a single white female. Conway’s personal weaknesses parallel those of the deceased female victim, and overshadow her effectiveness by skewing her view of colleagues, suspects, and witnesses. She’s hard on herself and everybody else. Some readers may find the Irish slang difficult to digest, but in truth there are only a few words that were hard to suss and stopped the flow for me. French’s “Faithful Place” is one of my all-time favorite books, but I’ve found her other titles hit and miss. This one’s a big hit."
"This is a very fine police procedural type book. I enjoyed the characters so much. How much work it is to go into a murder investigation with so few clues! The time spent chasing down witnesses, canvassing the neighborhood and always wondering what you're missing; what theories might work and what is just plain guesswork. Our lead detective in this case isn't well liked by her squad which adds a great deal of side interest.

The length of time it took me to read this book was no indication of my interest. It's a great book but my time was spent in a great deal of overtime at work and time with my grandchildren.

Thank you to my local library for my copy."
"I LOVE Tana French novels! This one has it all- and it is really all in the subtleties of the character development. Make no assumptions in the plot- it is a twisting winding road likely to leave you questioning each step of the way. A simple sigh or glance from a character can mean everything because the author does such an amazing job at providing insight in ways other than simple dialogue. The victim in this story was difficult to identify with until her real story unfolded; meanwhile- it is easy to identify with the protagonist of the novel and her foes. Paranoia, revenge, obsession, loyalty, and partnership are all themes of this elegantly written intense tale."
"I loved it!

Yes, it wasn't as complex as several of her other books, but at the same time, the ending made perfect sense and was handled beautifully! The writing was just as clean and gorgeous as her other work so I was absolutely satisfied.

And by the end, I *really* liked Conway and Moran. Wouldn't mind seeing them in another case (not that I want Ms. French to stop introducing us to the rest of the Murder Squad - I'm sure there's a helluva story behind Roach that I'd love to know!)

That said, the audio version wasn't great. The reader was only okay, sometimes losing the voice of a character or mixing them up in the middle of a dialogue."
"Tana French is an amazing author. She does it again in this modern day Irish police (guarda) procedural. The mystery is spot on and the prose is so well administered. The interplay between the main character Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen is exceptional. I really thought something would come of it, but the author teased me with this until the end where she left me tantalized but not upset by the way the story of them ended.

The story in this novel is Shakespeare to the last - who is who? Who dunnit? Why dunnit? Whose on first? I saw who it was before the end, but not too quickly. There is enough interesting things going on here that it didn't matter. Loved the book."
"So soory this is the last book in the series, at least so far. I really loves these novels, they are crime fiction with substance. I read them compulsively because I am immediately immersed in the world of the detectives on Dublin's Murder Squad. Of all the coupled detectives, I like Conway and Moran together the best. They were coupled in The Secret Place with Moran as the lead and in this one it switched to Conway. I liked the way the murder victim's story mirrored Conway's story, it made things more interesting. I hope she continues to write like this, maybe starting a different series or finding a convincing way to continue this one."
"This was everything I want in a detective novel, and I'm practically jumping up and down and flapping my hands with delight. I love the way that the Tana French lines up the mystery - in many books there is a sudden twist, but these ones always feel like you're pulling yourself uphill, a fact at a time, and each fact brings different views into sight. There's a lot that's literary to like in this book beside the expertly done mystery. Always lots of well done imagery e.g. the title here: Who is The Trespasser? It works many different ways. I loved the theme of narratives and stories in this book. I also loved the partner relationship between Conway and Moran in this book. "
"Another impossible-to-put down book. I've been saving it for so long that reading it was a sigh of relief. And I wasn't disappointed. Antoinette Conway is fiery in a way that sets her apart from any of the other narrators in the previous books. She's in a place that I can kind of relate to - unable to trust anyone and hardened by disappointment. Her journey through her own feelings, her work life, and the case were nail-biting - there were honestly moments that I was convinced she was crazy and others that I fully believed everyone was out to get her. French must be getting a little bit soft - actually a hopeful ending!

I hope that she writes more of this series!!!"
"I love Tana French’s books. Once I start I honestly can’t put them down which makes them perfect for airplanes. All of her characters are wonderfully complicated people and getting into their heads...it sucks you in.
She is really good at writing people who are flawed, her characters can be brittle, volatile traumatized, confused, detached, emotional, in other words they feel like people.
She also really gives you a sense of Dublin, her characters span a number of social and economic divisions and you get a sense of the many different people who make up the city.
If you like a good, complicated mystery novel, I honestly can not recommend her enough."
"French is an incredibly gifted writer. I have read this entire series and loved every one. Her slow reveal of each character's past and its influence on the present is very satisfying. Several times I thought I had figured out where the plot lines were going but was usually wrong, but never in the way of some writers that create a surprise by going down a path that is completely illogical or for which absolutely no preparation has been laid. Highly recommend this book (and the series) to all lovers of police procedurals and mysteries in general. And it's a great audiobook - the narrator has a wonderful Irish brogue."
"I ADORE Tana French. Her novels are always so exhilarating, but not in a fast paced way. Like the previous Murder Squad stories (for me anyway), this one was difficult to get into. It always takes me a few chapters to get her pace and align myself with how she is telling the story. One part of my thinks I’m bored, but the other part loves what I am reading. And before you know it, you are three quarters of the way through the book, staying up until all hours because you HAVE to find out how it ends. French’s twists are huge, but her writing is so spectacular and subtle that they hit without you really noticing they are coming."
"This is only my second Tana French novel but already she is fast becoming one of my favorites. This is another story from the Dublin Murder Squad and it’s just fantastic. This one is told from the perspective of detective Conroy as she and her partner come off the night shift only to be handed what initially appears to be a domestic violence murder. As the plot unfolds, it is apparent it is much much more.

Anyone can get a recap from the book jacket, that won’t do it justice; nor do I want to give away any of the plot line as French is a much better storyteller than I am. Instead,’I’ll do the only thing I can do which is highly recommend this book."
"This was my first Tana French novel; I was sorry to have it end. Like some of my favorite mysteries, the actual ""who dunnit"" question and answer was secondary to the web of relationships, deceit, back stories, and hidden meanings that slowly come to the surface. Conway, the main character, goes through a lot to get to the bottom of this crime, and one of the fascinations is how her inner thought process is so clearly shown, especially as she goes a little bit off the rails. I think that this may have been one of the main points of the book as well as the gradual revelation of the final answer. But the villains of the piece are exquisitely drawn as well. "
"What a ride this was! So many twists and turns that in the end, it’s not the big reveal that packs the most punch. It’s my favorite characteristic of French’s books. Getting to see Antoinette and Steven’s partnership grow page to page while they chase more red herrings than a fish market.

I will say that I enjoyed trespasser more than Secret Place. Those teen girls were scary af. Something about seeing Antoinette confront her shortcomings while not becoming super sweet and docile was just fantastic to see. Although I will always miss Rob and Cassie, I quite enjoy this new partnership in Antoinette and Steven."
"The story teller is such a troubled but brilliant character who has come from a most dysfunctional family and yet she is trying to unravel the dysfunctional lives of others. She is sometimes reactive and hard to tolerate and at other times, some is someone we can easily love and want to protect. I think that Tana French can build characters that live just at the edge of our own experience, close enough that we could be their friends/colleagues but just a little “off the wall” so that we are often unsure of what she is telling us about what she sees...that is what grabs me - not only a great plot, but my entanglement with the protagonist."
"I love Tana French’s writing and The Likeness is one of my favorite mysteries of all time. But the ending of Broken Harbor and the odd mystic elements of The Secret Place left me unsatisfied so I was wary of starting on The Trespasser. Although Detective Antoinette Conway (Stephan Moran’s partner in The Secret Place) is not my favorite narrator, the style of the story went right back to all the things I loved about French’s writing from the beginning. She is masterful at weaving the inner thought life of the main characters into the narrative in such a gripping way that it keeps you guessing about what is REALLY going on until the last chapter. "
"5 fantastic stars for this whole series. I really enjoyed every book. Tana French has a certain writing style that draws you right into the atmosphere. Her detective characters are all so likeable and many layers to each one. Several plots and mysteries going on that will leave you guessing. These are not short reads, but worth it. I think this last book in the series, The Trespasser, was my favorite. Faithful Place is a close second as I liked the Irish family drama spin in there too. And the detective, Frankie, from that one was awesome. They are all good in different ways, it was hard to read anything else in between the books!"
"Another ending by French that had me holding my breath. This is a book about stories - the ones we tell ourselves, the ones we hold onto tightly, the ones we need to survive. French pulls into the light the story of a man who has to believe in how much he loved the woman he killed, how good and decent he is deep down. The ending reminded me of Detective Stella Gibson (of The Fall) saying, “You think you’re some kind of artist, but you’re not. You try to dignify what you do, but it’s just misogyny. Age-old male violence against women.” When women tell the story of men who hurt women, there’s a bareness and clarity to the whole thing. I love the way this book dealt with it. "
"All the reviews I saw before reading this said that Conway was the least likeable of the protagonists in this series. I must also be a paranoid bitch with daddy issues, because I loved her the most so far. I know that the crimes in each novel are less of a whodunnit and more of a good parallel to the protagonist, but I was still hooked. French has such a knack for getting me sucked into her narrators' minds until I'm just as jumpy as they are.

It also has the most honest, realistic dynamics between estranged parents that I've seen. The ending, as well as Conway's treatment in the office, also felt incredibly real to me in a raw, unpolished way."
"A meticulously plotted police procedural, which teams Murder Squad detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. They tackle the case of Aislinn Murray who has been murdered. What appears to be a relatively simple solve becomes complex, and French masterfully pulls us along. Her characters are well developed, the dialogue seems authentic for two Dubliners and the tension keeps mounting. I'd be giving away too much if I outlined the trajectory of the novel; so I won't. But if you like Michael Conway or Crais, then you'll find French's stories engaging and difficult to put aside for mundane things like reading the news or doing errands...."
"Loved the Tresspasser (hated Broken Harbour) Tana French never fails to up her game or to turn your idea of what a crime novel should be in. In The Tresspasser not to difficult to figure out early on whodunit. But that's not what Tana French is after. She wants you to see why and how the detectives can't see it when you can. Love Moran and Conway would read other books with them as detectives. 
Loved that the female detective Conway underestimates the abilities and intelligence of the female victim. The victim was naive but not stupid and Conway prejudices got in the way. Great scene between Conway and her biological father -want to see more of her definitely."
"Wow. I am so impressed with the layers of mystery that unfold little by little until the very last few pages. And how Tana French is so fantastically able to personalized each book to the voice of the detective who is telling the story, as each book is told by a different cop, yet still write each mystery so flawlessly in their own voice. The Trespasser has to be one of her best yet. Tana French is just such and intelligent and thoughtful writer who threads intrigue into every detail, and so convincingly brings you through the mind of the Murder D. I highly recommend the whole Dublin Murder Squad series. Absolute enjoyment from the first book to the last."
"My first Tana French novel and I LOVED it. I read part and listened part just because I couldn't wait to get through it! The Irish accent was lovely and has me saying "" Ay Jaysus"" & ""shite"" in my head all the time now! I loved the suspense, I loved the character development, I loved the snarky wit and everything that made the main character, Antionette, the perfect one for this investigation. It left me inspired with ""I wanna be more like her"". I appreciated that it was a slow burn and reading it felt like being a fly on the wall to an actual real-time investigation. I am excited to read more of Tana's work!"
"Prior to starting this one I worried that French might have run out of steam as this series continued. I couldn't have been more wrong. Why? For all of the usual Tana French reasons-- I loved being in the head of these flawed, but intriguing characters as they struggle with their own personal demons to sort out a convoluted mystery and use their exquisite talents to understand the complex internal world of witnesses, victims, and murders. This ended up being one of my favorite of the group and now I'll definitely move on to her more recent stand alone books. Again, her style of character development, snappy dialogue, and intrigue go far past the usual mystery."
"This is the most recent, but hopefully not the last of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad mysteries. This series must be read from the beginning, as each novel is narrated by a detective who appeared in the previous novel. This time out, Detectives Antoinette Conway and her partner are assigned to solve what looks like a domestic murder, but the parts don't add up. French gives us another mystery with a plot that steadily builds momentum, characters that ring true, some welcome humor and perhaps the best interrogation scenes that anyone has ever written. I hope there are more of the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries to come."
"I really enjoyed this one. Tana French at her Tana-French-iest:

—A first-person unreliable narrator who's unreliable not because she's lying, but because the lens she sees the world through is a little warped.

—A murder case that pushes our lead detective to unwillingly examine personal traumas and hang-ups.

—A mystery that's interesting and twisty not because it's a neat logic puzzle, but because the characters are interesting and twisty.

—An ending that leaves our protagonists disquieted, but masterfully moves them along their character arcs.

Everything I want from a Tana French novel."
"Less sinister than the first two books and still just as twisting and evasive. Bigger cast than usual I think, but every character felt incredibly centred and deep. The main character was so fun - biting, bitchy, and had an enormous chip on her shoulder that pushed her into becoming flighty and paranoid. The mystery was tightly woven and every time I felt like I had an answer, it slipped away! I was worried about the ending as it neared, but I should have known better than to be. I will forever devour anything this author writes.

(CW: rampant misogyny. It is always gross but the writing never pushes the reader to write it off, just asks us to bear witness.)"
"Last of the Dublin Murder Squad stories and a great ending. As always, a ton of twists and turns and the detective's life is somehow mirrored in the murder victim. I love the way they weave together. I really like Antoinette and Stephen as partners and how they work together and how differently they see things.

I had a suspicion of what was going on and totally got it wrong, which was satisfying. Great depth of character for not just Antoinette but all the secondary characters too. Lots of suspense and a good does of paranoia, which made everything else that much more intense.

Sad to see this series end!"
"When Antoinette and her partner are given a new murder case, the evidence is all circumstantial and not definitive. Breslin, a senior detective keeps pointing them in the direction he wants them to go to even if the result is not the truth. Gradually, the figure out the truth, something that could blow the murder squad sky high. The mystery was well plotted out. The other side of the story is Antoinette's inability to recognize that even though she is the only woman detective, most of the men only care that she does her job. The chip on her shoulder is her biggest challenge."
"I have every one of Tana French's books and this was by far her best work. French has a way of weaving the fabric of a story so that you can feel the threads coming together, but you can never see the end until it has been seen shut. Everything about this story is engrossing, particularly the characters. Tana French has a way of developing her characters so that you feel as though you truly know them, love them, despise them, or pity them. If you are a fan of true crime (even though this is not), mystery, or just need a good read, this book is for you."
"Tana French back on form with this one. We're with Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran again, from the fifth book, only this time through Conway's eyes. Had no idea what was what with the mystery, or how it would wrap up, until the very end (just as it should be). French does an amazing job capturing Conway's paranoia and the sense of everything closing in around her - always watching over her shoulder to see who's trying to knock her off the murder squad. Also, it's really nice to see Conway and Moran still working together. "
"I love Tana French books. She is such a consistently good writer, it's always a great day when I see she has a new book coming out. It's a similar reading experience every time.... starts out slow, sucks you in, and twists and turns right up to the end, where you close the book and feel sad that it's over. The Trespasser was just that, with the added bonus of a being a second book about Detectives Conway and Moran. If you've never read a Tana French book, go back to the beginning and start there. You don't have to read them in order, but they're all so excellent that you might as well. "
"What an absolute belter of a book. I won this book a few weeks ago in a Goodreads giveaway and have finally got to it on my ""must read this book next"" pile. This is a gripping murder story with fabulous characters and the twists and turns had me hooked from the outset. I have only previously read one of Tana French's books but I now have to get them all! Come on telly people, get this brilliant tale made into a six parter. An easy five star review and I cannot praise this book enough. Great!"
"Audiobook.
Find all of the synonyms for "" riveting ""and ""gripping."" After you've heard the last chapter of The Trespasser, you will think that none does justice to this book. This is the sixth Tana French book I've read and this author just keeps getting better! No cheap red herrings with Tana -- just twisted my brain around her little finger. Not necessary to read her Dublin Murder Squad series in order but doing so will give you an appreciation how she continues to improve. Never insults her reader's intelligence. She is a stand-out in a very crowded field! Cannot recommend enough."
"This is the first novel I've read by Tana French, and The Trespasser left me wishing I'd discovered her Dublin Murder Squad series much, much sooner! I read this while in this middle of a mystery novel phase, and absolutely loved it. It's one of the few books that have made me laugh out loud, with one of the most likeable protagonists I've come across in a good while. Since reading this book, I've bought three more copies to give away as birthday presents - a sign of how strongly I recommend it. I can't wait to catch up on the rest of the series! "
"I would give this book 6 stars if I could. Tana French has done it again with this sixth installment of the Dublin Murder Squad series. In this story, Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Detective Steve Moran are investigating the death of a beautiful, young woman named Aislinn Murray. Nothing is as it seems - with the prime suspect's story and with the rest of the Murder Squad around them. This is a classic procedural told in Antoinette's voice. She is a tough woman with her own history. I could not put the book down. Looking forward to the next installment."
"The 6th book in French's excellent Dublin Murder Squad series, I'd rate this a solid 4 1/2-5 star read. Antoinette Conway is the only woman in the Murder Squad and after a series of pranks and harassment, she begins to suspect everyone. Her partner Steve Moran keeps her balanced. Assigned the murder of a young woman, a ""domestic"", both find that this case is like peeling an onion, and everything they learn is complicated. A fascinating and interesting read with great interrogation dialogue. "
"Wow! This is Tana French's best book yet, and I would love to read more about Detective Antoinette Conway. Big and bold and in-your-face, Antoinette is fighting the misogeny of the Murder Room where she is a newbie. It's the job she's always wanted, but finding that the constant dueling is grinding her down just when she has finally landed a big case. You can't help rooting for her as she comes closer and closer to finding the evidence she needs to put away the man who murdered a young woman in her own home, and who has deliberately cast suspicion on the young man who loved her. "
"Another brilliant mystery from Tana French. This is my favorite of the ones I've read (and I've read all except The Faithful Place). The complexity of her characters--they're not always likable--is what drives these novels. I was tearing my hair out, trying to figure out just how all the pieces of this story would fit together, and whether we'd see justice done at the end. French did not disappoint--the protagonist had to develop some self-knowledge along the way--but I felt it was a very satisfying ending.

I hope we see more of Detectives Conway and Moran!"
"I finally caught up with Tana French, though I'm sure that as I was reading her latest book, yet another is on its way. About 100 pages in I was sure I knew who dun it, but I kept on reading, because the book really isn't about who dun it, but about how people feel about it, and in any event I was wrong about who dun it in the end, which was very satisfying. This book is a bit less informative about contemporary Irish society than the others. In general, Tana French's literary skills grow stronger as she proceeds."
"Loved it! Loved it! So good! This is the book that you take with you to the bathroom and cannot put down! It had me guessing from start to finish, and even when I figured out who the killer was, I still loved the unraveling.

Sure, the final explanation of the character arc was a tad unnecessary to me. And the timing of the main character's estranged father's return was a little dramatic. But on the whole, I LOVED THIS BOOK. I stayed up for hours reading the last third, and I bought a copy less than a week after I finished reading it."
"Not generally one to rate a book, but this author is good....I mean really good; in my mind, one of the best authors whose books I've ever read. She's a great and very eloquent, smart, and funny writer who weaves a great story, captures your interest and keeps it until the very end....you can't put her books down! From the very first book of hers I read, I couldn't wait to read another. Always checking to see when she has a new book out; I definitely haven't ever been disappointed in any of her books! Highly recommended; give her books a try!"
"Like Zootopia, but better. I want to be Antoinette when I grow up. Tana French is kind of what I expected but didn't get from J K Rowling's murder mysteries. This was 100% flawless, hooking, touching, and astoundingly clever (the occasionally charming details/language of the Irish setting don't hurt either - there were fluttering stray snippets of beautiful, atmospheric descriptions just randomly scattered throughout the serious plot that completely blew me away). I need to read the rest noooowwww."
"I loved The Trespasser by Tana French. It was the second book I’ve read in the Dublin’s Murder Squad series, although not the second in the series. Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran’s partnership is tested as they investigate the murder of Aislinn Murray, a person Antoinette knows from somewhere in her past. The Trespasser is a great mystery with lots of suspense, but not a lot of needless violence. The narration by Hilda Fay was fantastic. Her Irish brogue and spunky attitude added a lot to the story. Definitely a good listen and/or read!"
"I liked everything about this book. Tana is one of the few authors who creates a completely engrossing believable fictional world, and characters who breathe with life. I have read the preceding Murder Squad books and I hoped this would have more of a HEA than these had...and I was happy that was the case. I didn't really care about the main characters going into the book (and admit to not really liking the main female or male characters even by the end, though they were the ""good guys"") but I loved the story, and savored every word like the world's finest chocolate. "
"I think French is remarkable. Her characters are real and nuanced, with psychological motivations that make sense. Her pace and plotting are also very good. This is the first of her’s that I’ve read, so I don’t know if they always include parallels between the detectives’ lives and the crimes they are investigating, but it was very effective - and thought-provoking - in this one. She seems to be asking how much we should let the “stories” we make up about our lives actually influence us. That theme is repeated multiple times, but very subtly. "
"Hilda Fay expertly narrates this new entry in French's Dublin Murder Squad series. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are again at the center of this novel (they paired up originally in 2014's The Secret Place The Secret Place - though its Conway narrating this time round.) Understated, suspenseful and tightly plotted - this is one of our favorite series out there. "
"I knew at the end of reading ""The Secret Place"" that I wanted to read ten more books just about Conway and Moran. I also knew that I wasn't going to get to, but at least I got one more in ""The Trespasser,"" which didn't disappoint. Conway's sharp edges hit very close to home sometimes, but it made the character all the richer and the payoffs of shifting plot all the more satisfying. A story about the power and peril of getting too caught up in your own stories -- I wish I could have as much disdain for it as Conway. Instead, I think it was my favorite yet (but I say that every time). "
"French seems to be very consistent when it comes to writing above-expectation murder mystery books and this one is really really great too. I loved the whole premise and plot and twist especially the ENDING. However, you might probably hate the narrator for half of the book bc i found her too bitchy for my badass female character. Now, im having a hard time choosing which of French's book is my most favorite cause i think all of them are very very well done. For now, The Secret Place might be my top one with this one probably follows after that."
"So sad to have finished the Dublin Murder Squad works. These books truly took me by surprise! I’m not a detective/police procedural novel type of person, so I was excited to find myself utterly drawn into Tana French’s series. Highly recommend The Trespasser and the rest of the murder squad books for anyone who likes believably flawed characters that you nevertheless love to root for and mysteries that keep you engaged the entire way through. I’m keeping my fingers crossed she’ll add a couple more down the line 🙏🏼"
"As always, French has woven an intricate, compelling, and beautifully narrated mystery. She has written a real and distinct voice for our new narrator, and the shadows of bias, doubt, and distrust are deep. It was especially fun to have Stephen Moran return, as you could practically hear his thoughts, in his voice, as Conway observed him.

I am sad to leave this series behind. But I was glad that it left off with Conway, as her story gave a sense of closure not just to the mystery-at-hand, but to the Murder Squad itself."
"Jaded Detective Antoinette has a bad rap with the other cops (racism, sexism, old boy network) and she and her partner Steve struggle to solve murder case while senior cops are thwarting their every effort. They don’t know if Breslin and McCann are dirty cops or hiding some larger crime. Once Tana French starts to unpeel the onion, it’s pretty clear who killed Aislinn and why, but I still really enjoyed this one. I like the rough characters, the descriptions of the investigation room dynamics, the interviews and how Barbie Aislinn turns out to be a cunning woman out for revenge."
"This was a stunning book for me. The author challenges the main narrator's perception of reality so cleverly, without making it confusing for the reader or making it hard to wrap one's head around what's actually happening. The stories we believe about ourselves and those we hate are deeply challenged; the whole book forces you to think clearly about what is real and what isn't. In fact, the murder and the solve are only vessels for Antoinette's final realizations ... it's all about shadows and darkness transmuting into the gold of the real.

Simply beautiful."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Told from the perspective a female murder detective, French gets the level of paranoia the detective feels just right. Are the people in the squad out to ruin her, is that other detective on the take, how much is the head of the murder squad in on it, does my partner have my back, etc? As usual, French takes you down dead ends in the investigation that are mostly realistic (though 
that mob angle was pretty thin from the get go ). I hope she keeps this series going (with hopefully better execution than The Witch Elm... ugh... atrocious)."
"Wow. Wow wow wow. I've mentioned this before, but Tana French is like Stephen King: so amazingly talented, her writing alone carries you through her otherwise forgettable plots. Once in a while, though, such talent finds a worthy story and all that genius previously laboring under crappy plots is suddenly freed to astonish the reader (King last did this with 11/22/63, and French does it with this book). This is a modern-day mystery (published in 2016) that rivals anything by Raymond Chandler--and I really, really, REALLY admire Chandler."
Tana French spins another interesting and fast paced tale from the Dublin Murder Squad. The story starts with Detectives Conway and Moran being thrown what they believe to be a domestic gone wrong. It doesn't take long for them to believe that there is more to the case than what appears on the surface. As the story unfolds the reader is led through a series of twists and turns and you just want to keep turning pages as you follow along with them. I can't wait for the next tale from the Murder Squad. Each one has been riveting and this was no exception.
"Tana French is my favorite mystery writer, and this book did not disappoint. I loved how each character, even if they make only a brief appearance, was developed and realistic. The main character, a detective who sees herself as an outsider that doesn't fit in to the squad, was compelling in her independence and her tenacity. The book's length ensures that I really felt like a member of the murder department, following them on each and every step of the process. The ending was satisfying without being cheesy."
i loved the duo of conway and moran in broken harbor and even more in the trespasser. as always tana french is simply brilliant at fleshing out characters--i could see and hear every one of them and when the book was over i wanted more. antoinette's fury is palpable and i still want to read more of her even though she is seriously flawed and a bit on the unlikeable side. the theme of fantasy lives--the dangers of them as well as their pleasures--was well explored here and i think this may be my favorite of the series.
"Not a fan of brusque detective fiction, I was won over on this one. I generally prefer the more analytical, detective fiction where the sleuths epitomize subtlety and reason. These characters were neither.
Brash, crude and aggressive, these characters, Conway, Breslin, McCann and Steve, forcefully argue, provoke and harass people. They analyze everything from every angle, while pushing and prodding people and witnesses All in all, it added up to a bit of a page turner. Were they going to be able to find the murderer and would they be able to prove it? And who could be trusted?"
"This series is so good I'm having withdrawals from it, and the thought that there might not be any more in the series is really worrying me right now. This is the first one I've rated 5 stars; although it may not necessarily be my favorite of the series, I think it is the best, if that makes sense. Antoinette shows the self-destructive tendencies of so many of French's characters, but as you find out more about her background, you can understand why. I'm having a hard time writing this without too many spoilers, so I'll just stop there and say that I adored this, if you like the other books in the series, you'll most likely enjoy this one as well. If you haven't read any others in the series, this isn't a bad one to start with."
"Another winner. Just when you think you know who it is, and you are just waiting for the detectives to discover for themselves, it takes another turn. Ms. French writes well, and it's not just the same old mystery; there is so much background on the detectives themselves, their weaknesses, their problems and insecurities, so the protagonist is not some super hero. I like the idea of Dublin as a setting too- not always LA, NY, or SF. Most of her books are in this series (Dublin Murder Squad) but they stand alone. You do not need to read them in order. "
"Hang on tight

Right to the end The Trespasser will keep you white-knuckled. Tara French writes with exquisite detail and changes the plot with on a dime. She is ferocious and unrelenting in going after her story. I have been binging through her Dublin Series; The Trespasser is number 6 ; it is one of the most thrilling. A detective team has landed a murder case which involves a tightly timed murder and two possible murderers, one of whom is also a member of the Dublin Murder Squad. Highly recommended."
"This was a fantastic read with just the right amount of character back story and introspect. It's hard to give much detail in reviewing a mystery without giving spoilers, so I'll just say that I felt plot was appropriately woven with options for your imagination to run with. I was literally excited as the book began you wrap up and was very curious to see how it all played out. I rarely find myself emotionally invested in literary characters, but the author did a great job of getting that out of me too. I loved it!"
"This one was rich in themes that keep me thinking well after I’ve finished reading. Most prominent is how we spin narratives to suit us.
Another theme has to do with character arc, and I’m not sure I can write about it without giving spoilers, but it’s really good. The main character is a ball of fire because of it.
The mystery itself is so taut. It unfolds into this beast of a situation that you kind of see coming, mostly don’t, but are mortified any way you slice it.
And it’s peppered throughout with a sharp sense of humor, wit, and high drama.
Just love Tana French."
"Fantastic. I sunk right in and was hooked. Could not put it down!!! New murder detectives are given a domestic case right as they’re going off shift. I’ve if the seasoned D’s is out with them to oversee, push them along. He is playing they, they feel played. There’s distrust and looking over shoulders.
But Moran and Conway are into something. Bent cops? What is bring hidden. Everyone is ducking with them but they don’t stop, and they get mucked up in the middle of it. Solid till the last page!!!"
"If you like murder mysteries and you like them gritty this is your book. At times the book was like sand paper on an open sore. I felt for the victim, the Guarda, the prime suspect and at times I hated them. This book ran the gambit of emotions for me but never funny or nostalgic. It is well written, strong and at times bitter but the conclusion is a reward in itself. Worth the read but be prepared and forewarned. Many of Tana French books are written in the same style but this one is more forceful and more powerful."
"I think I had already read this book when I picked it up but I couldn't remember what happened so I read it again. I've always had a love/hate relationship with Tana French""s novels. I couldn't figure out why I had such dislike for them when they had some really high praise from reviewers I admire. I think I've finally figured out to accept that her books are more deep character analyses that happen to also solve a crime. Rereading this book helped me to recognize that and in the end I really enjoyed it!"
"A 4.5 rounded up to a 5. I don't know what to say, I just really love Antoinette, even with all her flaws. She and Steve's dynamic is chef's kiss. This is my 3rd Tana French/Dublin Murder Squad book, and I've really grown to like the style that these books are in: the intermeshing of both the external (murder case) plot and the internal (main character turmoil) plot. I had sympathy for everyone, even the antagonist. A good zippy weekend read all around. Excited to see more of my loans come in for the rest of her catalog."
"This book is my favourite of all the DMS series. The protagonist is highly credible and defensive - as you would, in her shoes - the story is terrific, and the fact that no one is exactly what it seems is even better. I enjoy this series by Tana French, but a strong female protagonist has a special place in my heart. (I could not connect to Cassie Maddox in Book 2, even though I loved the plot.)

As in literary style, the way French makes us feel like we were in the room takes my breath away. I could swear I was there for the interviews, stake-outs, and stale coffees."
"Dublin Murder Squad #5. Like other books in this series, the cast includes minor characters from other books. This one is told mainly from the perspective of Detective Antoinette Conway. With her partner she is assigned a suspicious death, what looks to be a straightforward domestic violence case, with an obvious suspect. But it turns out to be much more complicated.

I loved the way the characters emerged slowly from the action, and their interactions with those around them. The dialogue, including the questioning of witnesses/suspects and the related commentary, has an authentic feel. As does the tensions within the murder squad and the myriad ways that sexism and misogyny are manifested. As the case unfolds, Conway has more and more doubts. Is she paranoid, or is somebody in the squad really out to undermine her?

Each time I read a book in this series they seem to get better. This one would be hard to beat - until next time."
"Tana French is an incredible crime writer. I have loved reading this series, and I am sad that it’s over. I can’t wait to read it again. She has an excellent hold on creating characters, their relationships (both positive and challenging), and the tension that is inherent in the type of work her characters do. I think this book was as solid as her first one in this series, which is universally accepted as her best, and I couldn’t stop reading this once I started. I have a ton of respect for French and her writing, and she has quickly become one of my favorite authors."
"Another really enjoyable Murder Squad book by French. It definitely impresses me that her books are on the longer side for mysteries but there is never a dull moment where the story drags. I felt anxious to keep reading the entire time. As I’ve thought with the other books, the mystery is good and avoids cliches, so nothing feels too far-fetched. This is my third French book, and I plan on reading more of this series, so I’m curious to see if she writes from any perspective besides a tough, hardboiled detective. "
"Might be my new favorite of the series...or at least tied with Secret Place. An interesting case that ended differently than I expected, a narrator whose personal bullshit wasn't *too* tiresome, and for once no weird dangling plot threads.

Antoinette and Stephen are just wrapping up one case, and a few moments away from leaving when a seemingly mundane domestic case comes in. Rather than wait for the day shift to show up, the gaffer gives it to them. They assume it's because they both have kind of a bum rap with the squad, so they're only going to get boring cases. They're official partners now, after working together on the prep school case (which is never mentioned, nor is Stephen's role in catching Frank Mackey's brother in Faithful Place either. I had to reread both reviews to refresh my memory). I said in that review that Antoinette had one mode: bad cop. She's more three dimensional here, thankfully. She still sees Stephen as sort of a wide eyed simpleton, but she's shrewd enough to understand that they complement each other.

I also said that Antoinette's biggest issue in Secret Place is that she acts like a wang to everyone and then doesn't understand why she sucks with witnesses. It's unclear how much time has passed since the previous book, but she has a better handle on herself and how to play to her strengths (also that book is from Stephen's perspective, and she's certainly a wang to him the whole time there, so I can kind of see how that might color the narrative). Here she's convinced the entire squad -- plus or minus Stephen, depending on her mood -- is out to get her, ruin her career. She strikes me as the sort of person who's always been difficult to like or get close to, because she keeps people at arm's length so they don't have an opportunity to hurt her. But at the same time she's just aching to belong. She desperately wants the friendship and camaraderie of a squad, but anytime it seems like it might be headed in that direction, she shuts it down or talks herself out of it. She's frustrating, but I did like reading about her.

In addition to thinking the squad is out to get her, Antoinette is also convinced she's being stalked. I figured this would be the hanging thread, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it (mostly) resolved. 
Turns out she's sorta right: her estranged father tracked her down, and instead of being a normal person and speaking to her, he cases her house for like two weeks until Stephen hauls him into the house so she can give him what for. Once she realizes who he is and what he wants, she all but threatens to shoot his ass to get him to leave. I suppose it's not *emotionally* resolved, but it was a relief not to have that random stalker business left over. Anyway, the stalker thing makes both her and Stephen suspect that the girl's death may have been suspicious, even though all signs point to her sniveling drip of a dinner date. But they talk themselves into the idea that she was seeing some gangster, and he put out a hit on her, and also her father disappeared when she was a kid and maybe he was also a gangster...it's such a wild goose chase that I was fully convinced the explanation was going to be mundane and simple.

It's not, and French keeps us guessing about who and how and why, and then about what will actually happen when the truth comes out. 
Turns out, Aislinn wanted to know what happened to her missing dad, so she tracked down the detective who'd worked his case...a dude named McCann who's now on Murder. First she just wanted answers, but when she finds out that McCann knew her father just ran out with a mistress and deliberately kept it from her and her mother, she's apoplectic. She decides to ruin his life: she'll seduce him, get him to leave his wife for her, and then dump him. Of course she's in way over her head and although he does fall in love, she meets someone she actually likes (the aforementioned drip, who actually reminds me of a guy I once went out with who was paralyzed by the decision between draft or bottled beer). McCann showed up at her flat as she was planning dinner for the new guy, and when she tried to throw him out he snapped. He called another detective, convinced him he'd just stumbled upon her dead body, and told the guy to keep an eye on the investigation. It's all really suspenseful, because even when Antoinette and Stephen put all the pieces together, they have no way of knowing how deep into the squad the conspiracy goes and that McCann has a good chance of just walking away. I suppose there's a tiny bit left hanging because he manages to convince the gaffer that it was ""just"" manslaughter, when the medical examiner's report proves that Aislinn fell down onto the corner of the fireplace and THEN the killer delivered the fatal punch. Which means it was intentional. But...details. Dude isn't walking back to his wife and family like nothing's wrong.

I guess the only question I'm left with here is: is this the last of the Murder Squad series? In the past you could sort of sense who was going to appear in another book. Here, we've already had Stephen's story, and most of the other guys are floaters who barely register. I hope this isn't it, because for me the series has only gotten better as it's gone on. I'd be happy to read the continued adventures of Antoinette and Stephen, quite honestly!"
"This is only the second book I've read in this series, but I'm glad I gave it another shot. The lead character had a unique voice, and I like how we gradually got to see more sides of her. I liked her, but there were moments that it was difficult, and I think that made her seem more real. The book was very good at leading me to exactly where the author wanted me to be. The mystery aspect was very effective. I enjoyed the themes. They fit the novel and felt very natural."
"Another great one by Tana French. I didn't particularly like the main character, in fact, I liked her partner better than I liked her, and I didn't understand her motivation a lot of the time. But, the story was still great and the tension definitely built up as the story went on. There were quite a few peripheral characters that I wish were either explained more or at least put in context more, but other than that I loved the book. I could barely put it down once I started reading. "
"Since The Trespasser was the selection for my bookclub this month, and I was completely unfamiliar the author, I looked around on Goodreads and discovered all her books were lightly interwoven, so thought hmmm.... let's check them out.
In about 3 weeks, read them all, obviously enjoyable enough to keep me going! But this one was incredible! The best by far, had to stay up until 1am to finish, been quite awhile since a book has hooked me quite so thoroughly"
"Ms. French is up to her usual high standards. Loved it! I admit that one of the interest points for me is that her books are so specifically Irish. Unlike some books that can transfer to other locations, part of the charm is the location, the language, the people. Antoinette takes some getting used to, what with the tree trunk on her shoulder. About halfway through the book, I had a few doubts about where she was taking us, but ended up with another fantastic read."
"Tana French writes amazing suspense novels. I have read all of her Dublin Murder Squad books and I look forward to any new books she writes.

This book has you guessing and second guessing who killed Aislinn Murray. It also leaves open the question of whether detectives Conway and Moran will be able to continue working together as partners. And, even once the mystery is solved, there is still a surprising twist at the end. Well worth reading!

"
"450 pages, but it went so quickly because the story just sucked me in. (which is true for all of Tana French's books) Nothing in it dragged, even when the detectives were running in circles, because her stories are so involved and fascinating, and the characters are likeable (even when they're being very unlikeable). Can't say enough about this author, I love love love her writing style and will continue to devour every one of her novels."
The main character in this Murder Squad mystery is Antoinette Conway- and she is feeling persecuted by her comrades in the squad. This murder is assigned to her just as she is questioning whether she will continue in the squad. Aislin has been found dead and the possible stories of her final moments are seemingly endless. She and her partner Steve Moran struggle to keep it all moving forward. A tale of living out the stories we spin - for better or for worse.
Tana French is one of my favorite authors. I always know when a new novel of her's comes out that it is going to be great and engaging right from the beginning. I love how each novel changes perspectives to a new character that we have already met in previous stories. There is always a twist and the conclusion is wrapped up well in the end. I like that the setting is in Ireland and I like the psychology that Tana puts into her characters and story lines. 
"Tana French is possibly my favorite author right now, and this book went beyond my expectations, which were quite high. I found the writing of this book to be like the main character – emotionally honest, straightforward, and getting to the heart of difficult things that someone else with less courage would ignore. It's a special read. I didn't want it to end. Can't wait until she writes another one."
This is the first book that I have read by Tana French and I loved it. The writing drew me in instantly and the complicated story with the psychological backgrounds of all the characters was fascinating. I cared less about who the murderer was than what the motivation was behind every character. I can't wait to read all the other books. Though it was a long book I couldn't put it down. Perfect read on a long flight. 
"Yep. Tana French now officially in my rank of very top writers. This one was pretty much perfect. I love also how she has basically re-invented the series. Now I'm wondering who her next viewpoint character will be. I'm kind of hoping for O'Kelly, the gaffer (boss, to us non-Irish readers). Possibly with flashbacks to his younger self?

But knowing French, it'll be that irredeemable asshole Roach. And I'll still read it."
"Tana French is my hero. She shows respect for her reader from the first page to the last. None of that ""Oh, I have written enough words to comply with my book contract, so let's wrap up this story in a paragraph or two and get on with the next one."" No, Tana gives it her all in every page. And each page is a jewel.

Each book in the series stands strong on its own, but the deeper pleasure is watching the squad evolve over time."
"I'm ashamed (but not really) to admit that I read this whole book in a little over twenty four hours. Parts of The Secret Place felt boring to me, but I physically could not put this book down.

I love Antoinette (though she makes me miss Cassie) and Stephen, and I hope they'll stick around for another book. I still have to read Broken Harbor, but I think this one has to be my favorite of the series."
"This has to be the best Tana French book I have read. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are a great combination. This case involves possible corruption within the murder squad and Conway feels persecuted by everyone. But, typically, not everything is as it seems. The interview sequences are superb. Every word needs to be savoured. There is disappointment and frustration and, in the end, a degree of satisfaction. "
"Last 100 pages, I literally bit all of my nails off including my skin, and I don't bite my nails. My heart started pounding on pg 379 and didn't stop til the end. I made my 3 year-old watch Disney movies all afternoon, so I could finish my book. #momguilt. Could be my favorite Tana French book, hard to tell since I've loved them all. As an author, her writing gives me courage to embrace more edge. "
"I love this series and must say that because of the character Antoinette Conway, this one has edged out The Likeness as my favorite. Everything just clicks in this one. Without a doubt, my favorite crime series and I'm hoping that she's got #7 in the works. My only dilemma is that I want more with Conway and Moran, but she typically goes with different detectives in each book...they've been in the last two though, so will we see them again? "
"Well Tana French...you FINALLY got me. I figure out Tana French's mysteries every single time, and usually pretty early on. But I keep reading them because they are entertaining stories. By this time...I did NOT se it coming. My killer was wrong, my motive was wrong, my last minute twist was wrong...all wrong. Even until the last second I kept thinking but maybe it's still this person...or maybe this...or maybe that...Well played Tana French, well played. "
"Someone recommended Tana French to me and while I don't read too many detective tales, I picked up The Trespasser and was immediately hooked by the voice (of Detective Antoinette Conway), the setting, (Dublin) and the circumstances surrounding the death of Aislinn Murray (complicated). Stayed up till 4 a.m. finishing this one, which was very bad for my work productivity later that morning. Next time I read a Tana French novel I'll be careful to start on a weekend."
"This is my first foray into the Dublin Murder Squad series. Tana French is an outstanding writer...good plotting, well-drawn characters, believable dialogue, an interesting look into a unique world of murder detectives. My one complaint is that the book is too long and little repetitive in places. Suspense novels should rarely or ever by 450 pages. It's hard to hold the suspense that long. But, I enjoyed it enough that I am reading another book in the series."
"
Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad is probably my favorite mystery series, mainly because it doesn't focus on just one detective or pair of detectives. This book focuses on Det. Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran, both of whom appeared in the previous book, The Secret Place. This one, told from Antoinette's point of view, follows the detectives as they investigate the murder of a young woman in her home, as well as all the harassment Antoinette has faced since transferring to the Murder Squad from Missing Persons.

What first appears to be a slam-dunk-the-boyfriend-did-it case turns into something more complicated, especially after Antoinette realizes she's met the victim a while back, not to mention they both live in the same general neighborhood. The evidence against the boyfriend is circumstantial and in their desire to finally have a major case to solve, Antoinette and Stephen find their imaginations running wild through possibilities. But, could they be right? Things just aren't adding up for a simple solve and the pressure from more senior detectives working the case with them isn't helping.

French is skilled in moving along the story in what feels like real time while delving just as skillfully into Antoinette's psyche. And that's the best part of this series. Each narrator has his or her personality and it shows through the narration, making each book connected while being able to stand on its own. If you love mysteries but haven't read this series yet, I suggest you give it a try."
"I hadn't expected to enjoy this detective story, based in Dublin, nearly as much as I did. Like lots of people, maybe most, I've seen my share of boring detective things on television. But in novel form, especially in the hands of so skilled a writer as Tana French, this thriller proved really satisfying. Can't wait to read more about the Dublin Murder Squad! Tana French has impressive ability with narration."
"I have read all of the books Tana French has written. I like the fast pace and the dialgue is great. So far, The Trespasser is my favorite. It is a murder mystery with a lot of psychological twists. The main Detective, Conway, has a major chip on her shoulder but manages to smooth it out a little during the process of solving this case.

I also like the Irish-ness in the story. That’s where the dialogue shines. Good stuff all around."
"Masterpiece

One of my favorite authors has surpassed even her brilliant past books. The plot is wickedly tight, the settings are cold-fog real, and the characters are there in the room with you. You can smell the cigarette smoke off the detective's jacket. You can see the pastel interview room. You can taste the tea, gone cold in the cup. Most of all, you can feel the self-reflection and know that you, too, are wiser for it."
"Tana French is one of the top tier of police procedural/thriller writers. Like most of the best, the whodunit it not what drives the reader. French's dissection of Irish murder detective Antoinette Conway's fragile psyche is astounding. Tough as nails, Conway keep everyone at arms length: her family, friends, partner, and, most of all, the other detectives in her squad. Does it get in the way of solving the murder of Barbie-doll pretty Aislinn Murray? I'm not telling. I'll let French do it.
"
"A gritty, darkly humorous roller-coaster ride of a police procedural. Did he do it or didn't he? Who is the mysterious other man? Why does everyone on the murder squad have it in for Antoinette Conway - or do they? At times the character of Conway can be annoying but at least she isn't the stereotypical alcoholic detective. A much better ending than many works of this genre. Hope we see more of Conway. Can't wait to see if she does punch Roche!"
"It is a rare day in June when I give five stars to a mystery, but today is that rare one. Tana French has developed a fabric of plot that, while I had twigged to some of the red herrings, I had little idea that the final pages would be such a complex ending. The characters are her specialty, and the minor ones do not receive short shrift. For Dublin Murders fans, this one should set them on their heels. "
"TANA FRENCH IS GOD. That is all I can really say. Loved this book, love all of her books, I literally scour google for word of a new one coming down the pike. They are the most horrific of stories, but always told with a beautifully deft turn of phrase. The kinds of books that I re-read a sentence sometimes just to make sure I took in the way she wrote it. Tana French can't write books fast enough for me."
"Just amazing, like each of her other books. No matter how hard I try, I have never been able to predict the whodunnit or the ending of any of her books - what a skill she has! And with her changing up the main character each time, there’s just no predictability in her style or in the way the detective thinks. Wildly well done. This one was my favorite of all of them, I think. Sure hope she writes another!"
"Tana French is basically a writing god. Anything she writes is going to be phenomenal and this book is no exception. Fantastic and believable twists without even slightest feeling that she had to really work to make them happen, and characters that (as always) I’m completely sure I could run into around town. By the time I finish each book, I always feel like the characters are real enough that I want to invite (some of) them out for drinks and introduce them to my friends."
"Best murder mystery writer ever. Love the introspective, funny, quirky characters and the descriptions of Ireland. Here a complicated, no-better-than-she-should-be woman is murdered in her home with a romantic dinner laid out for a boyfriend. It seems as if conspiracies within the murder squad are affecting the investigation. The only flaw in this audio book is the reader who detracts from the story with unconvincing, garbled accents."
"I'm not big on putting up reviews but wow did I love this. I wasn't familiar with Tana French, but saw a big buzz about her on a group I'm in so I gave it a try. (Apparently, I picked up the 6th book in a series, but oh well.)

I listened to the audiobook. Love, love, love it. At one point I was so intent on the story that I completely drove past my exit on the highway and had to double back around."
I skipped the book with the teenage drama and read this one instead. And seems like it was a good choice that I made. I quite enjoyed this book. A lot of mental games between the detectives on a squad and unlike American detectives that zip through cases in high adrenaline situations these ones go through everything at a more normal pace of solving a crime and what all a detective can go through in that process. Brilliant writing.
"Tana French combines a first-rate murder mystery with complex characters who are all too human in their many failings. The end result is not only a page turner but also a thought-provoking portrayal of what trust, friendship, professionalism, introspection, and self-confidence mean when the going gets rough. This is the best of the three Tana French Dublin Murder Squad novels I've read so far, but all are three are excellent."
"I just finished reading The Trespasser by Tana French and I loved it. If you like detective mystery books, but also want some depth to the prose and believable dialogue (I've read some detective books that are gratingly awful in thise areas) I highly recommend it. This is the second Tana French novel I've read and I enjoyed both."
"I've always wanted to read a Tana French novel and this one did not disappoint. The cops were fully fleshed out characters and the book was much more about who they were and how this helped or hindered what they were doing in regards to the case. The case seems straightforward, and yet answers are elusive. Nice to read one that is not a serial killer or crazy person for a change. Definitely will be looking for more books in this series."
"Another thriller by Tana French.

In Dublin, Antoinette and Steve are two of the ""bottom rung""detectives in the murder division when their boss walks-in and hands them a new assignment. Both exhausted they head to the crime scene.
Soon they will be investigating a murder/manslaughter case. Filled with loads of unexpected twists and turns.

Terrific, terrifying and amazing Tana keeps you engaged until the very last sentence."
"I will always and forever love and recommend Tana French. This is a solid sixth (please, don't say it's last) installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. As I sit here wishing for more, however, this story does have a resounding ending that smells of a conclusion (though if it is, it's a satisfying one). I'll always hold out hope that Tana will write another, but if she continues with standalones, I'll take those as well. "
"Another superb mystery from Tana French. I really appreciate the way all of her characters live in shades of grey. They are complicated, and far from perfect, but each narrator's unique point of view colors everything they do. Antoinette Conway is no different; lone woman on the Murder Squad, she is tough and tenacious, but we also get to see the cracks forming underneath her steely surface. Loved it."
"I love reading Tana French novels. Her characters are complex, especially the other detectives that populate the world of the Dublin Murder Squad. As you follow this particular investigation of murder, you are completely drawn in. It feels like you are right there in the middle of the investigation throughout the book. While I have loved all her previous books, this one seem especially good. The one thing I know is that when I pick up one of her books, I won't be disappointed. "
Riveted. This book was slow at first but once it started going I was glued to the book. I thought about it when I wasn’t reading it and even dreamt about it. I hope that she will continue the series. But then I realized... there is no character in the book that I’d really like to follow. Maybe the journalist ...Or the dummy Roach from the squad. But I’d be more interested in seeing who shoe would pick and how she could spin the story to be something great like she does. 
"Tana French writes a great crime thriller. The character development is first rate. While the story bogs down in a few places, most of the time the pages are flipping by.

I particularly enjoyed Antoinette, the hard boiled detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. Tough, but psychologically complex. Brave, but a heroine with flaws. Ms. French is highly skilled in writing dialogue and great dialogue drives the story. This entertaining book is highly recommended."
"Tana French writes such consistently amazing books and I’m always blown away. The writing and the character development are just unmatched, and despite being 500 pages long, I could always keep reading by the time they’re done. Antoinette Conway and her parter get assigned a murder case that appears to be a relationship nightmare gone wrong, and get in nearly over their heads as they figure things out, and I couldn’t put it down. "
"Wow.
Every so often I finish a book that really makes me second guess all the other 5 star ratings I’ve given.
What a fantastically crafted story, every step of the way, the only certainty was my uncertainty.
It’s hard to describe the ride this book took me on without divulging it’s nature but anyone who enjoys a mystery, please give this book a read.
Masterful and exquisite to the last very drop.
Two thumbs way up."
"Well, this was the last one. . . haven't felt so reluctant about coming back to reality since I finished The Goldfinch in '13. In my opinion, you are underestimating French if you dismiss as ""just a mystery writer."" The level of social commentary she achieves through character development is brilliant. In this last Dublin Murder Squad Series book, she examines what can happen when we start to ""trespass"" on each other's stories, realities, core beliefs."
"Really enjoyed reading this book. Tana French is a discovery for me and I think she's a great writer.
As usual, a friend lent me this book and that's how I discovered this author. The book is a real page turner, well written and full of Irish slang which was a discovery for me.
Hope to read more from this author. I won't go into details about the story as others do that so much better in their reviews."
"Best book in the series! Interesting characters, a real well-plotted mystery. I was hooked from the very beginning.

For future Alex who might not remember what happened: 
Aislinn's dad went missing when she was younger. Turns out he ran away with a ""young one,"" but the cops decided not to tell her or her ma that, her ma's life was ruined and Aislinn grew up in the shadow of all that. Fast forward: Aislinn finds the lead detective, seduces him on the downlow to learn about her dad and plans to wreck his life in turn (get him to leave his wife) so when he comes over to see her cooking dinner for someone else, an actual love interest, and she tells him to F off, he kills her."
"I stayed up until 2am the other night to finish this book and, of course, it was incredible! The mystery parts of her plots are always good but I especially love her attention to detail when she writes about the characters. Conway and Moran are a great team in this book so you can't help but root for them every step of the way.

I've truly enjoyed every single one of Tana French's books. I wonder who #7 will focus on and when it might be published?! I can't wait!!"
"It's not very often that I'm satisfied with the ending of a mystery. Some authors work too hard to tie everything up in neat little bows or leave ya hanging without explanation. Tana French is so different! Endings are real, satisfying, and complete. And then you start the next in the series to meet some of the same characters again! Her descriptions are great and the characters are vivid.
I'm hoping there will be a book #7 of the DMS. Just finished and miss the Squad already.
"
"Tana French é para mim a melhor escritora de policiais, os seus livros tresandam a polícia, não só os espaços físicos, mas também as personagens que agem e pensam como verdadeiros investigadores, mas tem vidas, dúvidas e problemas como todos!!
Neste livro específico os interrogatórios estão muito bem construídos e as dinâmicas de brigada são muito bem explicadas.
Um excelente livro para o verão!!!"
"The Trespasser is my favorite of the Murder Squad Series, so far. As usual, French juxtaposes the protagonist's life history and ongoing professional relationships with the murder investigation in play. She draws parallels, and pulls threads to unravel the detective's emotional attachments to suspects and witnesses and fellow squad members. Psychology is always at the forefront of the hunt for clues and evidence."
"4.5/5 stars

I really enjoyed this book. I just love how Tana French writes engaging stories and interesting characters in her novels. And I was really engrossed in the story— especially during the eighty pages or so of the book. I loved how she concluded this story.

I’m very interested to see what Tana French writes in the future, whether it’s a standalone story or another series like the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"I loved this mystery novel, but it was perfect especially for detective-mystery book fans. The main character was rough around the edges, but I loved her for it as the only woman in the murder squad police force. You can't put it down after a certain point - at least I didn't. You start to try to solve the case ahead of the conclusion and you can probably do so, but the book will probably still have some surprises left for you at the end no matter what. "
"I usually do not like mysteries or crime novels. However, Tana French's work is the notable exception. I like all of her books, but this one is my favorite-perhaps because the protagonist is a woman. The novel takes you inside Antoinette's head, as she tries to unravel not just the homocide case to which she's assigned, but whom she can trust at her job and in her life. French weaves it all together in deeply satisfying ways. I was completely absorbed by this book. Highly recommend."
"The Toughest of Tough Irish Cops

Antoinette Conway is the “Voice” you hear in The Trespasser and the toughest cop you’ll ever find. Her cynical, angry voice floats off the pages of this thriller and sucks you into her world of hard work, hidden agendas and careless cruelty. This story has more twists than a road through the mountains and it’s worth every paragraph.

I envy the next person who picks up her story."
"Ok. So Conway and Moran are my favorite Murder Squad detective team and I am saddened that the series is over. Tana! I would love to read about the continuing careers of my favorite team and how their presence changes environment of the squad, from an Old Boys' School, to one of real equality and understanding. I know this sounds like a fantasy but how about brining in a supernatural element? The young witches from The Secret Place could caste a spell! Tana are you hearing me?"
"Tana French is my new favorite author. This book captivates as it reveals the ends and outs of being a female officer in the gritty male world of the Murder Squad, and is unflinching in sharing the doubts and insecurities of its main character and her complex relationship with her partner. The murder itself proves more interesting than first thought, and the actual solving is gripping to read. These book leave one moved and thoughtful afterward."
"I had been meaning to read Tana French's novels for a very long time and I finally got around to it by reading 'The Trespasser' which really blew my mind! I know that French had quickly climbed to the top of the modern crime fiction genre with her debut novel but I really wasn't ready for one of the best ever interrogation scene in fiction which was so intense and gripping that it made my heart race, not to forget that the amount of wonderful twists and turns this book threw at me kept me guessing who the killer was till the end. The characters are so fleshed out that all of them are unforgettable and the protagonist Conway battling her own mistrusts with the squad adds more layers to this suspenseful and thrilling read!

Consider me a Tana French fan now, as I'll be buying all her other novels soon!"
"Tana French knows how to keep her readers involved, moving through the in and outs of a police procedural with flawless grace and energy. The two most junior members of the police squad are assigned what looks to be an open and shut case, but as the evidence is developed, it moves into darker and more complex areas that are difficult to talk about and intense to read. I don't want to spoil the plot of this book. You just have to read it for yourself. "
"Great read

I enjoy Tana French novels. She is a good storyteller and the people seem real with all their quirks and abilities. In this one she writes about a female detective dealing with all the males who don't think women should be cops and solves a crime that others are trying to keep her from solving, she thinks because of their misogyny. I won't reveal the plot but she solves it despite the setbacks her and her partner encounter."
"The fine line between trust and suspicion that French has her protagonist dance is delicious. Combine that with the biting, sarcastic attitude that she imbues Conway with and we have a delightfully serpentine novel that I couldn't put down even at the rare bits that I felt could have used some tightening, such as the occasionally overbearing exposition of Conway's thoughts. My first crime novel read in forever and I'm glad I stumbled upon this book to get me going again. (4.5* rounded up)"
"Another murder mystery solved by the Dublin Murder Squad. Tana French has a way of fleshing out her characters with such great insight that it is like you know them and would like to meet them. Each book builds upon the one before and each is even better than the one before, although I am not sure how that can even happen. I loved every book in this series, I read them one after another, in order and now I am done and greatly saddened that I don't have another one to read. "
"Firstly I was scammed when I bought this book - Amazon charged me $22, but they shipped it from India where it was sold for less than $10. But that’s not a problem having finished this book and loving it. There were plenty of plot twists, anxiety inducing cliff hangers and ultimate it boils down to daddy-issues - we all have it but how much should we let it control our lives? Anyway I am done with detective novels, they make my day job seem really boring. I’m going to read about Buddhism now. "
"A perfect crime novel. The non-American-ness of this is what sets it apart. I haven't read any of the others in the series, but i will now.

The depth of detail, and the dissection of a scene in the first-person perspective is like nothing I've ever read before. French keeps you hanging on every word of dialogue. Even if you guess the central mystery right out of the gate, it won't diminish the quality of this book. So much to like."
"AMAZING. This was the first Tana French book that I’ve read and it won’t be the last. Tana knows how to write cops. The research and efforts she put into writing these characters accurately regarding their attitudes, how they interact and the office politics was excellent. This book had me guessing from the get-go. I couldn’t put this story down and wanted to read late into the night every night as I tried to find out what had happened. I HIGHLY recommend “The Trespasser”. "
"After the disappointment of ""Secret Place,"" French roars back in full form with Detective Conway in ""The Trespasser."" Conway and her partner are called to an open-and-shut case of domestic violence gone too far, except that the details won't quite fit. The story hit all the high notes. And my goodness, can French write. Her prose is astonishing. For a masterclass on how to do it right, you can do worse than close-reading her books. I only wish there were a seventh in the series."
"Four stars, plus an additional star for this book’s ability to distract me from the actual news cycle. Complex characters, both on the detective squad and on the perp side of the story. I was struck by how the crime itself was hardly central to the story. The characters were studied and realistic, and the author portrayed them vividly and brilliantly. No gratuitous violence or lurid details, yet the plot kept twisting to the end. Can’t wait to read more of Tana French. "
"“Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too.”

SO good, what a thrilling end to the dublin murder squad series"
"More or less the same character, great that there is more continuity in the series where there is a new main character for every book.

The book has a great plot, and the underlying story of living in one's self-made story put another perspective in the book which brought it to a whole new level of good.

The book was just great, hoping for more in the series even though its' been five years since this came out.
"
"This book was great. Being someone who’s read all the books in order, it’s such a surprise to see someone who’s been in the background for so long get put away for something so small. It was devastating for him, but the book ended greatly for the main characters. I think it’s a different style than the rest but that’s what makes it so good as the last book in the series (for now?). Tana French never let’s me down :)"
"Not the most complex of plots, but well crafted characters and dialogue and a fun read to see how it ll plays out. In particular, French is great at writing dialogue that's real and regional and not cheesy, as well as writing characters who you may not like but you want to see how they turn out as the story continues. This is one of my favorites of hers, though other books are more mysterious, or more complex, etc."
"I'm struck by how deeply the author gets inside the characters and how different they all are from one story to the next - I loved experiencing this story from the brash and bold, take no prisoners perspective of Antoinette Conway, very different to me. The ending was surprisingly satisfying - things working out (from a reader's perspective) perhaps because in the end the stories we all tell ourselves were stripped away letting the characters be their authentic selves. "
"Tana French’s gripping sixth novel checks every box from prose to plotting to suspense to characterization. When a beautiful woman is killed, Detective Antoinette Conway of the Dublin Murder Squad is pulled into a dark and twisting mystery.

The author is one of the best thriller writers we have. Her books offer readers compelling, intelligent thrillers with brilliant characters — including the wonderfully tough and foul-mouthed Antoinette Conway."
"This is the last book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, and I loved it right to the last page. Tana French is a master at her craft, and writes with such intelligence. It’s a commitment though, with long chapters and deep, deep character development. By the end the reader is pretty much worn out but 100% better for the experience. As the Irish characters in the book often remark about really good stuff, “it was grand!”"
"Loved this novel! The characters, the writing, the mystery. So incredible. In most detective novels, the protagonist is like, ""This is my worldview and it's the only right one and I'll never change it."" But Tana French creates characters that are multi-dimensional and complex. I ended it feeling empathy for all involved, with the exception of one character who was pretty minor in the story. Highly recommend!"
"This was the best of the Dublin murder squad books. I LOVED it. Maybe it is because I got to see Conway and Moran together again after The Secret Place, but I loved getting into their characters (especially Conway who was the clear protagonist) and seeing how their backstories got woven in. French is brilliant the way the tiniest threads come together in all her books but this was the best. I am so sad these books have come to end. I’ve loved the whole series. "
"Damn, this is a good book, and not just because I read it on the heels of an Amazon freebie, tho those do make me wonder why I bother with them at all when I read something as beautifully written as this.

I hate - hate, hate, hate - stories of police corruption, of loyalty among cops even to the extent of letting them literally get away with murder. I was afraid that might happen here but she reeled it back in."
"This book requires a patient reader. It is character driven and requires 100+ pages to establish the characters. Your patience will be rewarded. I promise. Somewhere past the halfway mark I was riveted and could not put this book down. When I wasn’t reading The Trespasser, I was thinking about it. Tana French is a genius at developing deeply complex characters and setting them off on a collision course."
A slightly boring beginning but then I literally only put this down to get by with the absolute bare minimum in 'real life' - I am can tell I'm gonna read all of these within the month....and then be mad at myself for not 'saving them'. When you have been reading mediocre books for long enough that you think 'maybe I'm the problem' and then you encounter an essentially perfect series of gripping novels....ah.
"Throughly engaging . . .
As always, French writes a long book. This my 6th in the series and i really enjoyed this one, not necessarily more than any one of them, but this one was a bit different. Detailed as usual, fullmof substantive, engaging background, and at times funny. The continued growth of the subjects was engaging. My habit is to read, and separately the audio version. The narrating was fabulous."
"Great detective story. Rich protagonist, twisty expertly-woven plot. A tiny bit tedious with all the second guessing and paranoia going on in the protagonist’s head, but chock full of action. Hard to believe the actual story takes place over just a week. Also, bet ready to learn a lot of Irish slang, if you don’t already know it (fun!).
Kept me going until the last minute page, and that doesn’t happen often."
This was really good! Had all the normal Tana French goodness - well-drawn characters and multiple little stories merging in to one. I was happy to see Antoinette Conway get a spotlight as I really liked her character in The Secret Place. Hope I don't have to wait for too long for another installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series!
Absolutely love this series! One thing that is so unique is that there is a different detective each time. There are crossovers with the squad and some of the detectives which allows French to do what ever she wants without you having to swallow that one detective is supper human. Very creative. Excellent writer. She takes you interesting places and the Dublin setting is interesting.
"I love-LOVE-Tana French. She's hands down my favorite author. Her books are consistently excellent. Beyond excellent. The Trespasser is my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series. OH GOD THIS BOOK!!!! I can't even articulate how incredible it is. If this doesn't win book of the year then I don't know what book deserves to. Tana, don't ever stop. You are 100% gold. "
"Great read couldn't put it down

I haven't read a book that gave me the feeling of being inside so many people's heads at different times. Great characters and a compelling story. There are some laugh out loud moments and descriptions as well that help to break the tension as the two detectives Antoinette and Steve try to piece together this murder."
"Just as beautifully written as the others in the series, The Trespasser is a pleasure to read. One of the great things about author Tana French is her conversational way of writing -- you can almost convince yourself you’re in the room. The story moved along at a good clip (daddy issues and all), and by the end, despite its 464 pages, I found myself wishing for more. "
I'm a sucker for a good series. I gotta read them all! #tanafrrnch better have further plans for her #dublinmurdersquad series because I am hooked. I couldn't wait until #thetrespasser came out in paperback I had to read it ASAP. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ #bookreview #bookworm #bookstagram #shelfie #hardbackbooksaresexy #readinbed #reading #paperback
"This cop mystery has everything

Okay, it is a long winding road to a head on collision in the end. Extremely well written. The slang is sometimes difficult ... but, now I feel I have learned a new language. The characters are strong and the story is clever. I hope to read all of her books."
"Breathless!

I love all uk mysteries and police procedural, even the bad ones; but Tana French is a whole different continent. She writes it as if she's lived it. I was squirming during the last chapter like I was in a life altering situation.
I wish she could churn these out once a month.




"
"A good mystery for women who enjoy reading about strong women. It reveals the everyday insecurities of men with fragile egos who work diligently at trying to make women look incompetent, something most women know first hand--and who ironically are the incompetent gender due to their vulnerability with attractive women."
"This is the second Tana French book I've read and I devoured them both. Both were raw, intense stories that pulled me in from beginning to end. I think what I liked the most was the author's insightful descriptions of the events, characters, interactions, and the the deep emotions revealed (and not revealed). I'll definitely be reading her other books."
"I'm not a murder mystery fan, but I like Tana French. This is the 3rd book I've read. While I see that this is listed as #6 in the series, each book is self-contained and about a different detective. That keeps me interested as well. French has the freedom to create a new main character with each book. And the characters are always complex and compelling. "
"A thinking person’smystery...beautifully written. As evidence lines up, the plot changes and changes again. The beauty here is in the development of the character, Detective Antoinette Conway. She has to face herself and the facts of the case. My favorite Tana French Dublin Murder Squad mystery so far. "
"As always, Ms. French nails this character—to the wall in a way. Once more adopting a fresh face from the squad, this broody ruminating protagonist misunderstands her whole life. A fun departure from Tana's often male-focused voice, ""The Trespasser"" is all a suspenseful thriller should be, including plot turns, character 360s, and the point of view of an utterly fallible narrator. "
I love murder mysteries. She is truly one if the best. There are so many twists and turns. Just when I figure I know who did it she twists it again. She gets you into the detectives head and all the demons in their head. I read this in 2 days when I had tons to do. Needed to find out who did it. Love love love this writer. No spoilers for you. Read it your self. 
"I really liked this--maybe not as much as Faithful Place, but it was definitely my second favorite of the series to date. I love Antoinette as a narrator, her relationship with Stephen, and her struggles with finding her place on the squad--she's very prickly but still easy to root for. The mystery worked well, and things came together beautifully at the end."
Tana French has to be at the top of my current favorite authors list. Books I buy in hardback as soon as they come out. This won’t disappoint. Each volume is connected - but has a different detective protagonist with a unique voice and set of issues. French gets Antoinette Conway spot perfect. Now I am just wondering who will be featured in book 7...
"The best book of the series. The narrator switches from the 'The Secret Place' to the other partner for this book.

A take on the dead body but no sign of entry and the doors were all locked trope. But the interrogation scenes are excellent.

If you haven't read any of Ms. French's work, you can start with 'The Secret Place', then read this."
"Wow, I haven’t loved a Tana French book this much since In the Woods. Terrific. I’m exhausted just reading the analyzing and re analyzing of Conway. Spoiler**I loved the ending. There’s always a 50/50 chance that at least one, if not both of the lead “d”s is gonna leave the squad in French’s books."
"Tana French never disappoints! Since I read this novel right after finishing Secret Place, I had trouble remembering that this novel was told from Antoinette’s point of view instead of Steve’s. But after a while, I fell in love with Antoinette’s total bitchy no holds barred attitude. I love how French not only focuses on the mystery itself, but also on serious development of her characters. "
"Great writing.

French's skill with dialogue alone makes this book a brilliant read. Added to that is her skill with plotting, red herrings, and character creation. Her main character, Detective Conway, is someone that we the readers should hate, but she is so well crafted that somehow we don't. A thoroughly enjoyable novel."
"Excellent book. Two newbies in Murder D are given a shocking case. They
follow the trail through and solve the case.

Characters are will written and each is a ""free standing"" individual. This is one of the joys of reading books by Tana French. Detail of characters, location, inner thoughts and the surroundings are detailed and complete."
"Detective Conway has a big chip on her shoulder. Everybody on the murder squad except her partner, Moran, is out to get her. They get there big break when a slip and fall turns out to be murder, but the detectives spend nearly as much time working around their peers as on the case itself. Conway is a downer and there's tons of Irish and Irish cop slang, but it's still a worthwhile read."
"I have enjoyed the murder Squad four years. I'm glad that I have come back to this series. Tana French is good at her job, and I love this Twist on a series. It's not expected. I appreciate all of these different points of view from these different detectives. And this one was a good dark twisty one."
"Bellissima storia, un giallo che ti lascia senza fiato e ti riempie la mente, cercando teorie non ancora percorse che potrebbero risolvere il caso.... alcune frasi (due o tre in tutto il libro) non sono riuscita a capirle o a capirne il senso, ma probabilmente questo a causa della traduzione, non ci ho dato troppo peso perché comunque erano frasi di importanza limitata. Consigliatissimo."
"Tana French, a cup of coffee, a comfy chair...

Pretty much all I need to keep me happy. Her characters are the best, even when I think I don’t like them at first, they always suck me in. I’ve never been to Dublin, but with her. I hope she keeps the Dublin Murder Squad going for generations!"
"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! This was probably my fave of the series. When the last book ended I had hoped that Conway would be the main character of this one AND SHE IS- I was utterly delighted by that. I think she is also my fave character so far as she was so complex and had to not only solve the murder with her intuitive partner but had to do so while literally fending off coworkers who are supposed to be on her side. I did not see any of the twists coming bc French is a goddamn genius. I would highly recommend this series to ANYONE that likes murder mysteries, but this book was definitely the cream of the crop! "
"https://elleisforliterature.blogspot....

I love how French makes us feel we know the Detectives and all the players in the case. As always, phenomenal writing! Can't wait to read Witch's Elm. Tana definitely deserves the title of First Lady of Irish Crime."
"Another marvelous French go-round. Antonette is a fascinating character; as always the emphasis here is equally on the flawed detective as on the crime itself. Many red herrings keep us riveted, plus Antonette's struggles within the squad as an outsider, with her long-lost father's reappearance, personal embittered life."
"I am spellbound by Tana French’s writing. The main characters are Conway and Moran. They are assigned a murder case of a young woman. There is much mental conflict over the aspects of the case. The ending is one that I am going to have to reread. I did not anticipate it at all. Many red herrings to get to it.
Well done!"
"""The Trespasser,"" by Tana French is the best detective novel I've ever read. Her first, ""Into the Woods,"" is terrific as well, but Trespasser is the best, full of riddles, wrapped in mysteries, inside enigmas. You won't figure out who did it, then you wont figure out what'll happen to the killer, then you'll wonder what'll happen...etc."
"There are two main attractions. First is the mystery. It's an engaging plot and details are revealed at a good pace and in an interesting way.

Second, and more importantly, is the main character. We dive deep into the main character's mind and it's an interesting journey. The author has created a fascinating character who feels like a real person."
"Once again, I didn't realize this is part of a series. (It's not as though it's written on the jacket so maybe I could hunt down the first ones...) However, I will be hunting down those first five as I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was cleverly written, suspenseful, and the heroine kicks ass, no apologies. I hope there'll be more.

"
"I might be hooked after this one

I read Into the Woods after a recommendation and I enjoyed but I wasn’t enraptured. This one I couldn’t put down. Sometimes the details get to be a little too much but Tana French is an amazing descriptive writer. I regularly underline lines that blow me away with the imagery."
"Possibly her best so far.

This is a book about daughterhood, obsession, loyalty (the good and the bad), paranoia and redemption. As usual with Tana French, the plot itself is only the backdrop for incredibly crafted characters, which are the ones keeping you guessing layer after layer."
"Couldn't put it down,Tana French is so good at making it feel like real police work, with a different viewpoint character every time. Lots of interviewing and twisty back and forth in this one, which plays out over only a few days."
"I swear she gets better with every book. Great characters. Great plot. Great narration. I love how French shifts her narrators from one character in the squad to another--no time to run out of ideas for how to develop them, which always ends up in some completely unlikely action. I wish there were another one already ready for me to read!"
"What a great book, really enjoyed this one but finishing it was tinged with a little sadness as it’s the last one of the series which I’ve read back to back. I’m now going to have to wait for another Tana French novel as I started with the Wych Elm. I liked the tension within the team and the twists and turns as Conway & Moran slowly unearthed the truth - a truly great read."
"A good friend, knowing my love for crime novels, suggested Irish novelist Tana French. I was blown away by The Trespasser, a story set in Dublin and featuring some jaded cops. Her conversations are long and riveting, filled with Irish street slang and, as great crime novels do, there are multiple suspects almost until the end. Highly recommended. "
"I am a huge fan of Tana French's books. I love her clever, hip writing and her intense characters. So even though I always seem to find some smallish detail that doesn't quite make sense, I don't care. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am happy to know there's another book with these same characters that I haven't read yet. Yay!"
"I love everything she's written EXCEPT The Likeness, which I just couldn't ""buy"" as realistic--that a person could look and act so much like her doppelganger that her long-term housemates and best friends, at least one of whom she's been intimate with, wouldn't recognize her immediately. Anyway, I did love this one! It was a great way to spend a cozy weekend."
"This was all I expect when I pick up a Tana French book! It had very well developed main characters with their own issues, and an exciting in depth story. This was the newest in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I haven't heard if it's the last or if French will write more in this series, but regardless, I look forward to her next book, whatever it is."
"Antoinette Conway might have become my favorite POV of all time. I'd love to say because finally she is a relatable female character, but she's way cooler than all of us. Especially loved the slow paced steady tempo of narration and the topos of how everyone creates their own story in their head and the co existence of different narratives."
"Love these books

The sixth in the series and I have to wait until October for the next one. Tana French’s books are smart, real and evocative. Psychological thrillers that have made long pandemic evenings fly by. Learned a whole new Irish slang vocabulary and I’m getting accustomed to bad grammar."
"Outstanding; Continuing characters: Dublin Murder Squad; Conway and Moran, partners from the prior book, return - this time with Conway being the narrator; when a young woman is killed in her home, the pair are assigned a veteran detective to look over their shoulder, they start coming up with alternative theories instead of the likely candidate of the girl's new boyfriend
"
"Good mystery. Better story about the benign and malign powers of the imagination. Even better story about friendship. This is my second time through. First time through I wanted to start it right over again. The last chapter releases all the agonising tension in a brilliant, brilliant flurry of goodness. Love this book. "
"One of the best books I've read in a long time. Very compelling character development and a story line that is hard to put down. So many authors these days have vacuous characters, completely implausible situations and improbable, mundane plot lines. This book is a delight after all of those. (I listened to an e-book and the narration was excellent!)."
"Oh my goodness. This book is just phenomenal. My only sorrow is that with this book, I have read everything this incredible writes has penned. Conway was brilliantly created. The idea that the expectation of sexism and misogyny can also act as blinders. Moran reminds me a bit too much of myself for comfort. O Reilly was a surprise."
"Absolutely brilliantly narrated. The plot was deep and Byzantine in its complexity. French occasionally pauses the plot to treat our senses to elegiac descriptions of the light, or the smells, or the feel of a thing; then gathers us up for another headlong rush into the plot. Not a spoiler, but I am positive that French will write another Dublin Murder Squad at some point. "
A phenomenal writer. French has an amazing ability to craft what might seem a hackneyed plot in any other writer’s hands into a narrative blade that slices into complex characters and the messiness of everyday life. I can’t think of any better writer now who elevated detective fiction into literature. 
"I'm normally a decent guesser when it comes to the results of mysteries but I was clueless until the very end on this one, which made me not want to put it down until I figured it out. The Irish sarcasm also made me chuckle aloud more than once - not sure I expected to describe a murder mystery as hilarious, but it was."
"Consistently outstanding

I've read all four in this series about homicide detectives and they are all outstanding. The dialogue is fast, character develpment vivid, dark without being depressing and so very smart. I couldn't put this.one.down. And I rarely write.reviws bc I never know.just what to.say, but these books are too good not to rate 5 stars."
"I loved this book! It starts out like a bad high school drama but then gets deep into adult drama and some next level plot writing. She throws in quality distractors and the story gets deeper and deeper into ""what the hell"" territory. I really liked the first book in the series and now I think I'll read the others. I couldn't put the book down, even when I really wanted to."
"Antoinette is a gritty character - Both hard to like and difficult to hate.

I thought the character development of the detectives as well as the plot points of the murder case were both really well woven together.

I’ve been binge listening to Tana French this year, and Antoinette is a favorite character"
"A Detective in Dublin must solve a murder and find a way to survive in a squad room where other detectives are working behind her back to get her kicked off the Murder Squad. The story moves right along, with intrigue and tension, making the reader wonder what’s true and what’s false. Well written, enjoyable to read plenty of plot twists and a great ending. "
"Tana French is an excellent writer, and, for me, this was the best of the Dublin Murder Squad series. The characters are well drawn, the plot is excellent, and the book is well written. Definitely a 5 star read. If Ms French decides to continue the Murder Squad series, she will have to work hard to top this one. "
"Here's another stunning crime novel from Ireland's Tana French. A brutal murder with little forensic evidence compels a pair of Dublin detectives to dig deeply into the victim's life. Gradually, they begin to realize that they have lost the cooperation of their colleagues and that solution to the crime may lie close to home. This is an intricate story told with grace and nuance. "
"I stayed up all night reading this book. The sun was coming through the windows, I was struggling to keep my eyes open to see what would happen next. Needless to say, this was an exceedingly suspenseful book, it locked me in and I couldn’t get out until I finished it. 10 Stars ~ highly recommend this book!"
"Great plot and character development to the final page

Every book she writes is better than the one before and she started at a good height. The Antoinette point of view of the partnership is deep and real and consistent with The Secret Place.
Can't wait to read the next.
Who will it be?"
The last (thus far) of the Dublin Murder Squad books is a masterpiece. Conway and Moran (from Conway's point of view) take on a murder mystery with suspect who reside within and outside of the law. French's dialogue and ability to weave multi-layered mysteries have never been more in evidence. Fantastic ending!
"Another gripping psychological procedural set in Dublin's Murder Squad

A superb Dublin Murder Squad psychological procedural thriller. Layered characters and delicate shading make French's books a rare treat to devour. Couldn't put it down, and the end left me breathless. Can't wait til her next!"
"Glad to have more of Conway and Moran!

After reading Book 5 in the series and being mesmerized by the partnership between Detectives Moran and Conway, I was hooked on their complex relationship and hoping for another chance to experience this team in action. Book 6 did not disappoint. Thanks, Tana French!"
"A very enjoyable read. The storyline is about a seemingly straightforward murder investigation and the inner workings and relationships of the murder squad. Personally I think Tana French has saved the best till the last in this series. Beautifully written, great storyline with plenty of twist and turns."
"This book took my breath away. What a read. Of the six in the series this was my favorite, but all are excellent as each one got progressively better in my view. I love how French gets us inside the detective’s heads as they solve the murder. Her prose paints such an excellent picture of the atmosphere, the weather, the squad room, the murder scene. This one had a nice twist too. I love Detectives Conway and Moran and hope there will be a book seven and we’ll see them again."
"I enjoy Tana French’s writing and have read her previous Dublin Murder Squad books, but the storyline of The Trespasser in particular was very enjoyable. Detective Conway’s feisty attitude is sure to keep you on your toes, and there are lots of little mysteries within the larger whodunnit. This novel is a page turner! Plus the ending is “happier” than most of her other works. "
"This is probably the first Tana French book that didn't leave me feeling a bit bleak at the end. However, that's not because she has given up on the spark that makes her works so good. The center of this story is still a deeply flawed detective whose biting anger in the face of the sexism and racism she has faced is equal parts a weakness and a strength as she pursues her case to the bitter end."
"Thank god. My last Tana French read was a 2-star which was shocking and I worried that I just wouldn’t vibe with Conway and Moran but this book was really good. We get to know Conway a lot better in this and finding out the “why” of her is important. This isn’t fast-paced but, once I got into it, I couldn’t wait to see how it would end. "
"My first book of 2023 and it was a winner. Tana French keeps one guessing through the entire book with an abundance of insight wisdom emerging from Conway along with the answers the Murder Squad seeks to uncover by the last few pages.

It was an altogether satisfying read and I give it five stars!"
"Tana French is so good at writing complex characters and unfolding mysteries in a way that keeps your mind busy, wondering, and doubting right up until the point that the truth finally comes forward. The dynamics of the murder squad are written with the same attention and care as the mystery central to the story."
"another great one by Tana French

How does she do it? Keeps me reading through the night, drawn in by beautiful writing, great dialogue...and the plot. Twisty, turning, always a surprise. Can’t call these detective novels, even psychological thrillers, just an amazing, riveting read. Onto the next...."
"After re-reading this series, I fell in love with Tana French all over again. Her characters are so real and rich. I love the overlap as each book is narrated by a different detective on the murder squad, like a murder soap opera. Listening to the audiobooks this time added more layers into the stories. Definitely read this. "
"One of my favorite books of all time.

The first time I read it, I thought it was slow and I found the narrator so annoying. I gave it a second read because, well, Tana French, and the second read blew me away. Is the narrator a little off putting? Yeah, sort of, but that’s the point.

I reread this regularly and am constantly looking for other books like it."
"This is a tense, jittery, first person story of a cop solving a murder. It’s a pretty narrow genre, and this may be a perfect example. We believe every second of it, and follow the narrator down every dead end, every wrong assumption, every stupid mistake, and every revelation. It’s no fun, but it feels completely real. "
"The last of The Dublin Murder Squad series and it was a good one. I loved how the story started and how the reader develops theories based on the characters but, in true Tana French fashion...everything changes. The ""guilty"" suddenly look innocent and vice versa. The game that Aislinn dangerously played had me sucked in...did not see it coming."
"Tana French is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. I loved being inside Antoinette’s head and joining her as she went down paranoid rabbit trails. The way the story unfolds, through an investigation with backtracking, restructuring, and dead ends feels like everything I want from a police procedural."
"a beautiful book to end the year, with probably my favorite protagonist so far. antoinette conway is a bitch who's smart as hell and trusts (Almost) nobody. that, plus daddy issues, a murder victim with her own secrets to untangle... ahhh. I think what I love most about these books is the way these detectives read the characters around them. this book was so rich in character, and the ending was so tragic and heartbreaking. "
"EXCELLENT detective story--kept me guessing till the end. So MANY flawed characters in this novel. There were no knights in shining armor in THIS book, except maybe the gaffer. But all the main characters, although complex, were fully fleshed out, and the story drew the reader in. Tana French is really an amazing author."
"i hate to fall for copaganda but tana french has done it again ... i love u detective garda stephen moran <333

(although this book does include some major criticisms of the irish police force so perhaps not 100% copaganda).

this was soooo fun to read during my trip to dublin! i was filled with such glee when i saw references to places that i've been to or passed by during my trip."
"I almost set this book aside because I found the narrator and main character too snarky and paranoid. At first, that was annoying, but then I came to see that she had good reason for being snarky and paranoid. I am so glad I stuck with it. The plot is genius. The suspense kept me reading all weekend when I should have been doing other things. I will definitely read more of this author’s work.
"
"To be honest, I put off reading this for a long time. Years, in fact as I read the first book in this series in 2015. I didn’t want the series to be over. I wanted to save it.

And, dang, as sad as I am that it’s over. I’m doubly glad that I read it. The Trespasser ended up being my favorite of the entire series. Conway is a boss and watching her let herself trust Moran was beautiful and seeing them take down the murderer was chef’s kiss amazing."
"Every time I pick up a Tana French book, I remember exactly how much I love Tana French's books. This one is dialogue heavy and short on some of her signature prose, and is probably not my all time favorite of her Dublin Murder Squad novels, but even with that said, her stories wrap me up and keep me turning pages long into the night. This time, the story features Antoinette Conway (who we met helping Moran solve his mystery in her last book -- now the two are officially partners), a woman so sure that everyone is out to get her that paranoid is too soft a word to describe her. She gets handed a case that seems straight-forward on the surface, but 400 pages later, you know its anything but. 4-1/2 stars, and I'm rounding up out of sheer joy at seeing Tana French on my bookshelf again!"
"Tana French is so awesome it makes me speechless. This is her best book to date - excellent plot, the character study of Antoinette was masterful, the tension, the pacing, the humour, the truth gah!!! Finished it in a day couldn't put it down! love Love LOVE"
"The Trespasser was terrific. I think it's my favorite Tana French book so far, and I really enjoy her writing. I really felt like I was in the head of Antoinette, the main detective. Tana does an excellent job with dialogue, jargon, mental gymnastics.

A very fun, intense mystery."
"Another excellent story by Tana, she really does a great job of making new characters different but having that same thread with the Murder Squad. None still compare to the Likeness however I'm very glad she went a normal route with this versus the 'magic' route with the Secret Place! "
If you are a fan of Dublin Murder Squad books you will love this one. Tana French works her magic again intertwining characters. Could not put the story away and just when you think you have all the answers the story bends in a totally different way.
Another great read from Tana French. I feel immersed in the culture as you watch the characters go about solving the murder of a young woman. I was never quite sure whether we'd discover the true murderer at all! Well done!
"I admit, I love Tana French. I found this book a nail-biter, because I was afraid the protagonist would fail. I will not say how the story ends, but I loved the spirit of the characters. I can hardly wait until Ms. French writes another. "
"Loved it! The Trespasser is the best kind of murder mystery - a strong yet flawed female protagonist, realism, a captivating puzzle and character building without undue seediness or gratuitous horrors. "
"This is the first book by Tana French that I've listened to while on the treadmill. Excellent work. Will definitely read more of the author's work, especially stories that are in the Dublin Murder Squad series."
Tana French just gets better. I was afraid she would do her typical destroying of main characters but I was pleased with how it wrapped up. One of my favorite games is to try to figure out who her next book will be about since she always takes a character forward. I'm going with Roache. 
French's books are so immersive and unique. Her characters are so real they stay with you from novel to novel. I care about them as much as I care about the plot. Well worth the wait but I can't wait for more. I want to go back into those woods....
"HOLY SHIT! Tana is one of my MOST favorite writers and her books blow me away (alright, NOT the Broken Harbor but the rest) This book was tangled, twisted and comes with an unexpected end. GOD BLESS STEVE!!!! FULL STARS!!!!


ANYONE ELSE MISSING FRANKIE? BECAUSE I WANT HIM BACK"
Tana French does an excellent job of allowing you to get inside of the confused mind of Antoinette. A confusing and thrilling ride to the very last bit. Highly recommend to those thrill seekers and girl power gals (and guys)! 
"I've been a fan of Ms. French's books for years. The latest installment in this series had great plot twists that kept me hooked to the end. Gritty, with many ""how should I respond to this?"" interactions."
"Oh, this was good. Intricate reveals, subtle unveilings, and as with all Tana French novels, quietly cerebral chills and absolutely beautiful stunning writing. I loved Antoinette Conway in this, in all her complexities and flaws, and this story sucked me in. "
"I thought I was done with Tana French after the last two novels. This was a gift, so I read it. This one is right up there with 'In the Woods'. I enjoyed it a lot. The characters have a complexity to them that makes their humanity jump off the pages."
"Again, Ms. French got me! As with all her books, I assume and anticipate the ending and get it so horribly wrong! She writes such plot twisting stories that you begin to wonder how any case is ever solved. Fabulous! "
"Ek bly 'n groot aanhanger. Soos haar vorige boeke lees The Trespasser soos 'n studie in die menslike psige. Dis uiters vernuftig geskryf, met kinkels in die plot wat die leser gespanne aan die lees hou. Die audioboek is meesterlik voorgelees deur Hilda Fay."
"I love this author. I love the way she interprets each shrug or eyelid flicker during an interrogation. The Irish jargon is fun. And the fact that even while the detectives are only focusing on facts, the emotional story of the detectives and witnesses are where the action really is. "
"This is one of my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series, and it does a great job of tying in the detectives' personal lives to the crime. I really wasn't sure if they would be able to successfully solve the murder, and the intensity of the story never let up."
I enjoyed having a female narrator again. I had a particular affinity for this book since I was bullied in the work place on several occasions. The uncertainties and defensiveness that Antoinette experienced were well familiar to me.
"Tana French created a fast pace detective story that included the main character's paranoia, tensions between co-workers, the highs and lows of the case, trust and betrayal.
I couldn't put it down and spent too many late evenings reading."
"I had the murderer figured out fairly early, but I didn't care. French makes every book a dark and delicious read, with the main mystery being not ""who killed the victim?"" but ""who is this person narrating the story?"" (And do I trust them?)"
"One of the Best of the Dublin Murder series

This one differs from some of the previous Tana French novels, in that Conway is the sole narrator. The pacing is great, with a riveting ending. Very enjoyable."
"A gritty detective story set in Dublin about a female detective solving the murder of a young woman who lost her farther and had an affair with a senior police officer, who killed her. Really good sophisticated read."
"Wow! As one reader said before, do her books get better as they go on? Hard to tell.
I'm just sad I motored through all 6 of them in a few weeks.
Fantastic series!! I recommend them highly. The Irish slang is educational as well."
"This is the first book in this series I have read. Now I need to go back and start the series from the beginning. I not only liked the story, but I listened to it on disk and really liked the narrator: Hilda Fay. Very enjoyable!"
Started this one before our Thelma and Louise road trip to Phoenix . . . the quality is consistent if not better with each book. Intrigue - office politics - what's real and what's just a figment of a character's interpretation of the ongoing events . . . masterful.
"As a mystery or thriller or novel, it's perfect. Well paced, creepy, page turner. And you get to know and are interested in all the characters. Must investigate her others after I give my brain a rest."
"Tana French comes awfully close to writing perfect crime novels. Every book is its own - no recognizable plot twists or stereotypical characters. I can't find fault with any of the six she's written, but it is obvious that she is improving with each. I'm ready for another one!"
"Another fine stand-alone crime novel by Tana French. Probably my favorite so far (well, ok, I've only read two!).

Characters are complex, classy, and ornery all at once. Plenty of plot twists, too. A fun read!"
"All-consuming murder mystery

When I read Tana French, I have a hard time focusing on my real life because all I can think about is when I can get back to the book. I can't wait to read whatever she comes up with next."
"better than the last Conway and Moran tale, and the last one was excellent. Loved the narrative told by Conway, and this book was good enough that i could not put it down! The exploration of what is real, what is imagination, how does paranoia come into logic? Really well done."
"Seat clinching good read!

A murder with more twisting than the rollercoaster! I was sure this woman was flat unlikable until she wasn't! Had to finish it...gonna have a book hangover tomorrow!"
"No supernatural element in this book. Some engaging twists. I sometimes was confused over who was talking,p (Moran or Conway), but I think that was due to having just finished The Secret Place and still having Moran's voice and pov in my head."
I am in love. Don't anybody talk to me again until I read every single one of Tana French's detective stories full of gorgeous poetic language. psychologically poignant internal worlds and ripping good suspense! My new P.D. James!!! 
Well written and a definite page turner this one. Not going to write a great long review as it spoils a story sometimes but if you love crime fiction then this author is most definitely worth reading. Great job 🙌🙌
"This was my first Tana French novel, but it certainly won't be my last. Dazzling dialogue, plot twist on top of plot twist. ""The Trespasser"" is more than just a crime novel. It is in a class by itself. "
"Good story

Enjoyed the ride. Twists & turns that all seem true to human behavior. Good characters & details. Irish slang was a trip in itself. Recommend & will look for more books by Tana French."
"For me the book started out very slow. I struggled through the first 50 pages or so and I wound up just putting it down. Didn't pick it up again for 7 months, and when I did it grabbed my attention right away. Couldn't put it down. "
"A friend of mine told me for years that I should be reading Tana French. She was right.

This story is only a police detective novel on the surface. It's really about the glass ceiling, misogyny, the old boy network, and everything we must resist."
"Tana French can somehow nail everything about police work and make it interesting. The puzzle of the case, the atmosphere and tension; it's palpable. I love her works and this one was fantastic. I love that minor characters from previous books become lead characters in later novels."
"This was by far my favorite Tana French book. I felt like it was the most suspenseful and it kept me turning pages. I also really liked the characters, Antoinette and Steve as partners worked so well. I loved seeing their relationship change over the course of the book. "
"Really great

Really up close look at the gears of a case with all the possibilities thrown in along with a healthy dose of paranoia. This is brilliant. A masterful work by an amazing writer!"
I would read a brochure if Tana French wrote it. I love the atmosphere she creates and I am always halfway through her books when I feel like I've just started them. This is not my favorite of her books (The Likeness) but it's really good nonetheless.
"French's novels are more about character than mystery, and she is adept at shifting the maincharacter’s POV from book to book. This time it’s Antoinette Conway, who has secondary roles in other installments. She is a deeply flawed yet engaging young woman, and the audiobook is brilliantly read in Conway’s voice by Irish actor Hilda Fay. "
"Loved this one. My guess as of 15% of the way in was *pretty* darn close, but not quite right. But this is probably tied with Faithful Place for my favorite of the series (so far). Bring on the next one, Tana French!"
"Terrific page turner

Lots of story, great twists, superb characterisation. I really enjoyed it.
A woman has died and two detectives are assigned to find out what happened. Is it straightforward or much more complex? Find out."
I have read all of Tana French's books and I thought this was the best one yet. I did have a bit of trouble with some of the Irish slang but I could usually figure it out by the context. Highly recommended for an excellent police detective novel with a very strong female lead. 
"A thriller to the last page

Complicated web of lies and two rookies detectives who prove to be better than the entire Murder Squad. Tanya French doesn't disappoint and keeps you hooked to the end."
Possibly the best yet of French's Dublin Murder Squad books. I won't post spoilers but I'll say that the whole plot hinges on trust and distrust. Thoroughly recommended - and you don;t need to have read any of the previous books in the series.
"She did it again!I don't have words.
The only thing that bothers me is that I have no idea when her next book is coming out.I hope she is working on it right now.I need it, after I have recovered from this of course."
"This book is my favorite in the series. Fast-paced throughout the full story, with the added bonus of enough mystery that I wasn’t sure how it would end. Also, had some good commentary on being an aggressive woman in the workplace."
"Well written, I couldn't put it down.

This was my first novel by Tana French. The lingo was not what I'm used to but I really enjoyed the book. She's a great writer. Well thought out plot. Captivating from start to finish. I will be reading more of her novels."
"I love everything about Tana French's books save one piddly thing...I am disappointed EVERY SINGLE TIME that a new book doesn't loop around back to the mystery of Detective Rob Ryan's mysterious childhood trauma.

Other than that, I loved everything about this book, too."
"One of the best detective stories I have read in a long time. There are (sadly) few books I find hard to put down. This was one of them. Good characters, great dialogue, lots of very believable twists and turns. Will definitely look for more by this author."
"Once I got into this book and familiarized myself with the Dublin dialogue, I remembered why I'd love French's first and second books. The Trespasser was impossible to put down. I read it in one day and now I'm on to another of her books."
"Tana French is a brilliant writer in my opinion. What a great murder mystery! This one ticks all the boxes. And I enjoyed the fact that the herione is a female detective, with all the problems that this entails. I could not put this book down and literally devoured it."
"4.5 Stars

Brilliant but not my favourite. Absolutely loved it though. Tana French could write about a west-country-village summer fête and make it creepy without even seeming like she's trying.

Characters were good, story was interesting, setting was fitting.

Definitely worth reading."
"I'll pick up anything Tana French writes, and I especially love it when one of the protagonists is a female cop. Antoinette isn't always fun to be around, but I enjoyed her nonetheless. As with other Tana French novels, the characters are so well drawn that you feel like you know them. "
"Of all books by Tana French, I like this the most. A nice smooth flow and all characters nicely handled. As always, French is capable of turning a 200 page novel to a 500 page novel with her imaginations and literary skills."
"I hesitate to say The Trespasser is the best in the Dublin MurderSquad series, since they're all so good and I'm pretty set on The Likeness holding that honor, but it was great, and definitely up there near the top. If Tana French decides to give us more of detectives Conway and Moran, I'm ready!"
"French is an excellent writer. I am held spellbound by all her books. I just wish she would use a little less of the foul language. It actually detracts from the good writing. Find the Antoinette character a little hard a tough, but I did not dislike her. Keeps you guessing whodunit?"
The Trespasser is the best mystery I have ever read. Cannot wait to read more of this author. Actually it is a best book also. She writes this book to read slowly and carefully. I certainly will read In The Woods. 
"SO GOOD. As good as anything French has written, favorites aside. Fantastic characters - Breslin is just genius. Loved it from start to finish. The audiobook actress, Hilda Fay, was perfect for the job. Made me never want to increase the speed of the playback, and it is a long one. But so good."
"so readable and lines to kill for

I've only read 3 tana french murder squad novels and I'm hooked. Twists and turns and insights into human behaviour...good and bad. Detectives with backstories and current stories..messy and believable..in parts. Completely addictive"
"I absolutely LOVE all her murder mysteries. The character development of every detective she chooses to highlight is SO RICH. And even if you know whodunnit, you're sucked in figuring out how they're going to catch 'em."
"Need more. I love this series.

I can't wait to see the next detective dragged over hot coals. My bet is on Roach or the floater Reilly, who is clearly hooking his bright spark to Breslin. I'm hoping the latter."
"Terrific read. Extremely well fleshed out characters. They are all too human. You certainly recognize yourself. Good atmosphere. Even though you soon figure out who may have done it, there are enough showers to keep ou reading."
"Excellent. Enthralling. Ridiculously difficult to put down. Superb character development, well executed multilayered stories to the plot, and fascinating and suspenseful twists. Among the finest fiction I've ever read."
"Amazing roller coaster of tension, keeps you guessing, great dialog, so well written it goes down like water. Love the paragraph at the beginning of the 16th chapter about how everyone has stories about their life going around in their heads, demanding to be let out into the world."
"I'm not sure why this book has such low reviews. I adored Antoinette. Her internal (and external) voice frequently had me cracking up. She's snarky AF but she's not wrong.

The actual mystery was satisfying with enough paranoia and second-guessing to keep you interested."
No surprise-I loved this book too. I love Conway’s no bull shit attitude and how she runs things. I really liked how this one turned out too. It was a precarious story but she did it artfully and it wasn’t over the top. I love French’s writing so much. 
Convoluted story that keeps you guessing as to who the real killer. Characters that are extremely well thought out and believable. Tana French is a master wordsmith that tells a tale that is extremely believable that will keep you guessing to the very end. 
"Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran work on a murder case and find that McCann a fellow detective did the murder. His friend Breslin tries to cover it up. At end, justice is served and they are ready to solve the next case. "
"Excellent! I could not put the book down. There were many twists and turns, and it was interesting to see the police characters who take sides, alienate and discriminate. It appears true to life, unfortunately."
"It’s difficult to spend a lot of time inside this character’s head; she’s brusque, blunt, uncompromising, no soft edges. But as she’s a murder detective, I guess you’re not looking for a fluffy kitten... Good mystery, layered, not an obvious ending but a strangely satisfying one. "
"Intriguing characters and a great crime story. The story is told by Detective Antoinette Conway, you really get inside her head and it is indeed an interesting place to be. Another great novel by French."
"I haven't met a Tana French Murder Squad novel that I didn't like. That goes to say some are better than others, but they are all brilliant in their stories and drama and twists. I thoroughly enjoyed The Trespasser and anyone with a keen eye on mystery or police fiction should as well."
Tana French knows how to grip a reader’s attention from the get go. A brilliant fast paced read that grips your attention right up to the last page. I highly recommend this book as well as all her previous novels!!
"The author has set a high bar with her previous books, and she cleared it with this one. Fresh, interesting characters. An inventive plot that kept me guessing. A resolution that leaves me satisfied. Well done."
"I’m a late comer to Tana French, but after reading this title and her recent one, The Witch Elm, I’m totally hooked. She spins a great story and her characters are complex, flawed in a believable way, yet likable. One of the best murder mysteries I’ve read. "
"Tana French does psychological and atmospheric mysteries so well! This series (Dublin Murder Squad) shares characters but is not a linear read. Set in Dublin, obviously, the plots are well constructed and unpredictable, the characters (suspects and detective) are complicated and flawed.Her books also get to the heart of modern Ireland. If you like psychological analysis along with your mystery (and strong atmosphere) you will enjoy Dublin Murder Squad mysteries. "
"At times in this book I actually thought I was 100% sure what happened. Thought I knew the ending for sure, and then would get hit with another twist and turn. I thought the writing was great and the story was even more amazing. Need to read more in the series for sure!"
"A gripping story. I suppose it is a crime novel but it has many other aspects. Included Are questions about loyalty, administration, interviewing, getting caught up in one’s own conclusions without basis. I could hardly put down the book."
"Well done!

This is my first book of the series, but there was enough that I didn't feel like I needed to read the prior books to understand what was going on. The story was different and interesting. I loved it! I'm looking forward to reading more from Tana French."
By far my favorite duo of Ds on the Squad. Good story and satisfying ending. Hope to see more from the author and the Dublin Murder Squad soon. Listened to the audio version and the narrator was fantastic.
"I felt really sad when this book ended. I missed the characters. I wanted to read it again the next day but I had finished it. I listened to the audiobook and the main character’s Irish accent was spot on. It was a very good book, entertaining, inspiring and feminist-fueled. Loved it!"
"I really think Tana French is the most talented writer of detective fiction active today, and I sincerely hope this is not the end of the series.

This one features a more challenging protagonist than in previous novels, and a more challenging killer--but all the more rewarding for it."
"Tana has done it again. This story grapples with themes of loyalty and reality. Antoinette is a complicated, powerful narrator whose competence and unique voice make this book worth a read, and then maybe another one."
"Tana French creates another brilliant mystery in “The Trespasser,” the latest entry on the Dublin Murder Squad series. Filled with complex characters, a twisty but plausible plot and stunning prose, this one’s a keeper. "
Close enough to a 5 star that I gave it one. Tana French has a gift for writing dialogue better than any other author in my recent memory. This book kept you guessing long past when you would think it possible to and still end the story. 
"Extraordinary. What happens when you trip over your own insecurities, when you have trust issues? Tana French has an exceptional ability to spell out how our brains can be our own worst enemy. Amazing job of making a mystery a quest for truth and honesty -- and not just in the suspects. Well done."
"The absolute best of the Dublin Murder Squad series, this was packed so full of layers of psychological tension I felt I could scream! Brilliant writing, I hope there’s more Antoinette and Steve in French’s writing future. "
"Love these books, but mentally having to deal with ""me and whomever are this or that"" is distracting. I was taught that it is ""Whoever and I are etc."" Just will deal with it, as you are the writer and I am the reader."
"Loved it. Good mystery, procedural, kept me interested in the evolving story. Lots of detail and long (449 pages) but I wasn’t bored at any point. Not sure everyone will agree but I loved the twists and turns. "
"A beautifully crafted complex tale seamlessly woven together. A brilliantly multi-layered detective drama with twists and turns and an ending both gut-wrenching, and heartbreaking in unexpected ways."
This author definitely has a keen sense and knowledge about her writing. The realism and scenarios are incredible .... all with an ending that seems like it will disappoint but takes a phenomenal turn. 
"Constantly fascinating

I loved this. It’s just so not a conventional genre novel - it distinguishes itself by both the quality of the writing and the depth of the characterisation. Utterly satisfying."
"Wow.

Tana French is my new favorite read. This one was a real page turner, and kept me guessing the whole way through. I’m blown away by French’s writing ability - she’s a treasure! I’m off to order my next TF mystery."
I stared this series with book #5. This book was great and not predictable at all. The clues are all there I just didn't see them. I really am enjoying this series (even though I have only read #5 and #6). I'm looking forward to another one.
"Quite a claustrophobic and intense unravelling of a much-more-than-it-seems murder investigation. Elevated by a narrator who doesn't hold back and displays black humour, downtrodden determination, good and bad chemistry in the workplace and keen eye for the human condition."
"I feel like I should have seen the twist coming, but at the same time I so enjoyed the character development and relationship between Conway and Moran that I didn't mind. I love the books in this series!"
So I was not going to give this 5 stars...and then I got into the book. I read about 200 pages today. I could not put it down! Do you know the amount of crap I was going to do today! Good twists and turns! Kept me guessing!
"Wow. This one really crept up on me. It’s not the kind of book where you care a lot about the characters- it’s more like a beautifully constructed puzzle with moving parts. It grabs your interest about 80 pages in, you’re into it then the last 120 pages you’ll stay up all night to finish."
"Sad that I’ve officially completed the Dublin murder series but glad it ended on this note. Thought this storyline was good, lots or different twists and theories! Enjoyed figuring out the characters and loved the main narrator’s character growth. Honestly the ending of this book was perfection, great way to end a fabulous series! (But please write more!! Love Tana French’s writing style and stories in these book.)"
"I think this is my favorite of Tana French's books!!! I absolutely LOVED this story and the narration from Antoinette Conway's POV. I loved the rapport between her and Steve, loved the complicated ins-and-outs of their theories about the case. SO so good.

Caution for language."
"Definitely the best in the series. Tana French has an amazing gift to be able to describe not only the gritty details of murder scenes and police work but also deep character development and amazingly atmospheric descriptions of her locale, Dublin. "
"Tana French never ceases to amaze me. Just when I think I know what's going on, shazam! There's a plot twist that throws me in another direction. This one was almost excruciating in this regard. Excellent!"
"I liked it. Thought Antoinette was a little over the top with the paranoia. Good twists and turns. A little unsatisfying in the end, felt unfair they didn’t get to finish the case with the arrest, etc. "
"Amazing, at a certain point I truly couldn't stop reading. I'm a bit sad that I finished all the Dublin Murder Squad books, but hopeful that French might come back to the series one day, and excited to read other books of hers as well. "
Definitely enjoyed this one. Antoinette Conway is an interesting character and I loved the twists and turns in this story. Tana French manages to write insanely long dialog sections that manage to stay natural and interesting. She's a fantastic writer and I am so glad I found her work.
This is the first book I've read in the series and it works well as a stand alone. The story focuses on an antagonistic and paranoid female murder detective and her investigation that implicates another member of her detective squad. A highly enjoyable read.
I rarely find a truly unloveable protagonist but damn if Conway didn’t try to alienate everyone...she almost got me but I loved her anyway. That said I’m glad I’m at the end of my stash of Dublin Murder Squad books because they are Heavy™️ and take a while to get over!
"Somehow I managed to skip books 3-5 and went from 2 right to 6, but it didn’t matter. French writes so you can skip depending on what’s on your shelf, and still find a great story.

I rarely guess her endings before she wants me to see them. I appreciate that."
"you want antoinette conway to win, you just do
from summer to fall i’ve been keeping up with this series and i feel this is the only dublin murder squad book with a good happy ending. fitting what with it being the last. 5, 10, 10000000 stars always and forever for tana french’s work"
"When you need a change!

Great story, great characters! It's the third Tana French book that I have read, and it did not disappoint. The plot is interesting, and the narrative is tight. Exciting and suspenseful!"
"Classic Tana French: a narrator who is losing herself and finds herself too close to the case. A bunch of intrigue among the detectives, and of course, a dead body that needs to be explained away. Just the way to escape on a few November evenings. "
"Tana French is becoming one of my new favorite authors. Having stories set in Ireland helps me feel like I might actually get to travel again someday. This one has so many twists and turns near the end, I’m not sure I really know who-done-it even after finishing the book. "
"Tightly packed narrative about a young female detective trying to solve a murder case. Throw in bias against cops, women, and outsiders in general and you have a tight novel. This is my favorite book by this author so far. Must read for anyone who is into Irish murder whodunnits "
"Well Crafted

Not just a mystery, interesting character development arcs and fine detail of the interaction within the squad. Enjoyed the longer read. Looking forward to what comes next..."
"I love how Tana takes you inside the minds of each detective, turning the previous external view of them into a more intimate and complicated one, resulting in affinity. Sad to see the series ended but loved reading each book over the last year!"
"Tana French scores another hit

I really like this author and have read most of her books. This one was exceptionally good... can’t put my finger on why. Cannot wait for more from this author."
tana french truly just gets better and better. her talent with character building is truly unmatched; only she could make me sympathize with the murderer. another deeply sad book from her... i’m going to need her to continue this series.
"So sad I've officially read everything in this series. Every entry has been 5 stars overall, but obviously I have my opinions about where they fall in relation to each other. I think the lower Goodreads rating on this one reflects that ranking rather than this novel's standalone qualities."
Tanya French applies the unreliable narrator fearful of conspiracies approach very well in this murder mystery and police procedural. The last act of The Trespasser is complicated and engrossing as all is brought to clarity. The audiobook reader provides an excellent listening experience. 
"I bet Tana French’s grocery lists are amazing. This woman can write. She’s magnificent and so are her stories, her characters, her prose.

I’ve enjoyed every one of her books, although this could be my favorite!"
"I love ""Line of Duty"", also Irish, which this book reminded me of. In both, the amazing dialogue in the interrogation rooms makes you feel like you're the one being questioned and has you sitting on edge. Vickie is Antoinette and Steve is Steve of course!"
"I thought I didn’t like the author’s portrayal of female characters. But Conway has more “man” in her than “gal”. Nothing to do with Conway’s proclivities. Still, and it’s so very unimportant. This murder, thriller is exactly that, a thrill! "
"Great, complex tale! Leaves you hanging til the very end!

Wonderfully wrought tale of deception, passion, loyalty and fear! You never know til the end whom to fear and who remains loyal."
"Brilliant writing. Characters are ""reach out and touchable"". Don't like a lot of them but Tana French crisply and precisely has such deep understanding into the human heart. The protagonist is fearless and relentless in her pursuit of truth. So nicely crafted. "
"One of the best

This read is a little long, but worth the ride. The plot has its twists and turns, but I could see no holes in it. If you stick with it to the end, you will be well rewarded. I simply could not put it down."
"I think this was my favourite of the Dublin murder squad books. It took me a year to get around to reading it because I disliked the fifth book so much (even though I liked Detective Moran), but I really enjoyed this one."
"Much better than the previous one in the series. While I truly enjoy the protagonist Antoinette and her partner, Steve, I thought the ending needed a little more oomph to it. Otherwise it was a good read with good character development. "
Hands down my fave book out of this series. It had so many twists and turns and I didn’t guess the killer AT ALL! I honestly didn’t want this one or the series to end but I’m glad it’s finished on a high note. 
I tore through this book. It's the first time I read anything from Ms. French and I'll definitely be reading other books by her. The characters were real and the plot was believeable. I felt like I was watching a movie when I read it because it moved along so quickly.
"The characters felt real and I was angry and excited and it was well-written as always. I'm unsure about the title. The titles of all of the other books in this series are more obvious. This one is more thought provoking. Not so straight-forward. Still, a great read."
"An excellent who-done-it

Written well, paced well, and intriguing, the trespasser excels as a mystery and follows all the rest of the Dublin murders squad in it’s exploration of family, the squad, and what it means to be human."
"That was the last Dublin Murder Squad book Ms. French has written. I feel bereft, with no more of her stuff to read. Her stories and characters are absolutely engrossing and she always saves her surprise reveal for the end. "
"This checked all the boxes for a solid murder mystery and with several plot twists I didn’t see coming at all. I’m not giving this five stars because it’s incredibly profound literature, but because I think this is a novel that is exactly what it’s supposed to to be and I enjoyed reading it."
"Oooooh I really liked this book! Loved the MCs, the story line the run around - even the ending was well done - I couldn’t put it down! Held my interest the whole way through, no slow spells - just what I needed!"
"A treacherous police squad procedural.

Finely crafted with amazing detail and characterizations. Quite a deeply brilliant genre novel. Intimate, chilling, moody and visceral tale from within the Dublin Murder Squad."
"I was really taken by the idea that everyone stars as the good-guy hero in their own story. What a shock when we wake up to reality! The writing was very different from the author’s other books, but exactly appropriate to this story."
"Once again, Tana French does not disappoint from the very first sentence. The emotional journey of both the protagonist and the cast of characters is deftly woven and keeps you glued to the story even beyond the twisty ending. Dive in, this mystery is more than most."
"This was a fun book to read. The main character, a retired cop from Chicago is a great character. The village and surrounding countryside of this rural part of Ireland are very well described. Her writing is so easy to read and she makes you want to be there. Well done!"
" The ""rookies"" on the Murder Squad catch a case that nearly ends their careers. Terrific exploration of the interpersonal dynamics of the squad and how the stories we all tell ourselves can mislead us. "
"As with all of the Tana French Dublin murder series books, I listen to this on audiobook. I love the reader and her accent. Again this was a fascinating story, of a woman and a classic male dominated career and the pushback she gets at every turn. I enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend it."
This book had a slightly slow start but once I was hooked I couldn’t put it down…and I was hooked pretty early. The plot was so well thought-out and it really kept me guessing. Loved another Tana French! 
"I'm so sad to have now completed Tana French's works. Her attention to detail is masterful, and I never knew that I would enjoy procedural mysteries as much as I have in this series. Conway and Moran have been my favorite detectives so far!"
"Tana French is becoming one of my favorite writers; not only of mysteries but in general. Since I love PBS mysteries it's no wonder I love her books. They have the same pacing, great characters and great plots. "
"Maybe Tana French's best. I enjoyed this one, even though I'm not a huge fan of the main character. Probably could have given it four stars to be more consistent relative to Secret Place, or maybe that one should get five stars."
"I thought I did not read this, then got it from the library and realized that yes - I had already read it. I think I did not remember because there were twists and I did not expect the ending. I would read Ms. French's grocery lists if she published them."
"Tana French does it again

Gripping, surprising, precise, this masterpiece of storytelling will bring you down, leave you breathless, and in awe of her insightful ability to look right in to the core of her characters. Fantastic read."
Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Enough twists and turns that you’re not quite sure who is telling the truth. The main character is complicated. She is sometimes the victim of her own anger so that further complicates the truth. Big fan of Tana French and this one did not disappoint. 
"Excellent way to learn how cops think. Bravo.

The story is ok, but thought processes of cops and the fact they're human with human struggles really are eye opening.
Just remember ""no comment"" can save you."
Damn! What a read! Tana has an ability like no other to get into her characters’ heads and twist a tale that is absolutely addictive. The quality of her writing is unparalleled in any genre. Really hoping she’s got another in the works!
"This was one of the best in the series. I loved the first person perspective, and the narrator for the Audible edition was fantastic. (I am mystified by the reviews that say the narrator was terrible. Go figure.) On to the next!"
"I can't believe I'm finally done with the Dublin Murder Squad series! Quite possibly the best audiobook I've ever listened to, Hilda Fay slayed the narration. I loved Conway's voice and I love her rapport with Moran, I'd read or watch a whole series about them."
"Beautifully written, full of twists and turns, lots of insight into human nature. One of Tana French’s best. As the blurb says, atmospheric and unputdownable. Plus, the narrator on the audiobook is outstanding. "
"Loved this book! The lead detective character so so funny! The plot was so good. Well written. I was definitely wondering with the Ds who did it?
For all the real life detectives out there, thank you!
I don’t do spoilers so enjoy the read!"
The Trespasser out of all the author books was just outstanding. I couldn't put it down would the truth come out was a question at one point. Read this book and see what was meant. By this statement...
"Incredible writing. I was completely and utterly engrossed in this. I absolutely loved the police procedural details. Here’s my Dublin Murder Squad rankings-

1. The Likeness
2. The Trespasser
3. Faithful Place
4. Broken Harbour
5. In the Woods
6. The Secret Place"
"The Trespassers by Tana French review

This book answered all my questions. The main character addressed every statement heard or overheard and wrapped up the story succently, solved the puzzle completely. Thank you for a well written book."
"This was so good. Tana French never disappoints, I never figure it out before the reveal. I thought Connway’s voice really came through in the narration leaving me paranoid and questioning everyone’s motives. I was very satisfied by the way the story unfolded "
"What am I sposed to do with my life now, just go live it sans next Dublin Murder Squad book??? 🥺🥺

nothing for it but to get to work on my 200k+ slowburn where Conway and Moran make a fallback marriage pact

P.S. Hilda Fay taught me how to pronounce “Loaghaire” 🙏"
"Another great Tana French story - lots of twists and turns, and the reader is taken on a very believable roller coaster of a ride to find the killer. Highly recommend reading the audiobook version, the variety of Irish accents is astonishing and so well done. "
"Excellent!

Loved this even more than some by this author. A murder that involves way more than expected. I love the Irish slang and the way the female cop narrating the story tells it in ways that made me laugh out loud."
"Can’t stop reading it.

The book pulls you into the story snd lives of the characters. Her descriptions of the emotional landscape are unique and add depth to the story. I already bought a copy for my sister
"
"Another Great Tana French Novel

I could read Tana French novels forever. The worst thing about them is when they’re over. That and the fact that they keep me from getting anything done because I can’t put them down."
"6th in Dublin Murder Series. Excellent. Highly recommend everything I have read by the Tana French. Her books are long and rich with color and detail compared with most mysteries, but they never slog. "
"This one did it!! French got me hooked again after the last two books being flops for me, The Trespasser was such a win - I was desperate to finish it and it constantly had me guessing, something I was beginning to miss. "
"I liked this one a lot. Antoinette is a little difficult to get to know, and we are led in down the wrong path sometimes because she is distrusting of the people around her. But the novel allows for a satisfying conclusion. And you root for her the whole time. And for Steve."
"I looked forward to picking up where I left off each day

I loved the tongue in cheek thoughts of the main character. She had an edgy humor that exposed her introspections. A fun read with twists around every corner. An enjoyable read."
For me her best book so far. I love Antoinette. I love how she takes on the big meanies and squashes them. I love how she thinks everyone hates her and she sucks at interviewing. How she scares the floaters. But she persists with an attitude to make us proud. TF's best creation yet.
"I loved them all

I’ve read all six of The Dublin Murder Squad novels …. Enjoyed them all. The Trespasser was terrific. I always feel like I’m actually sitting in the castle watching the story play out."
"I thought I had already reviewed this - but she's a treasure. I loved this, although the main character needed to calm down a bit. Still one of the absolute best mystery writers around."
"I've been a loyal follower of this author since her first book. The Trespasser goes well beyond the others in scope and theme and character! The theme of stories and the many and varied ones told by those involved immediately or tangentially with a murder case can push a detective looking for the truth to the edge, especially when she carries around a heavy pack of her own stories fed by her paranoia. This is a psychological thriller as much as a who dunnit (and how and why). The relationship of Antoinette and Steve provides a nice balance to their detection work--when Antoinette is not burrowing deep inside of herself (where she goes for safety and sanity, but produces their opposites). The pressure of the noise of so many stories about a murder can alter the mind. The author relays realistic examples of this noise, especially in the end. A tight thriller, but so much more. It questions the nature of reality. "
Another masterful mystery by the genre's shining star and arguably her best yet at sparking a range of potential solutions in the reader's head before arriving at a satisfying conclusion.
Tana French is such a good writer; she owns this genre. I have loved all the books in the Dublin Murder Squad; but this one is the best.
Loved it!
"This is the best in the series (so far). I love the characters she brings to life, especially the women. In my mind Antoinette Conway is alive and well in Dublin. "
Stellar! Takes you up one staircase and down another about twelve times in plot. Who done it???? Sh! 
Not much for me to write because it's almost 5 in the morning and I've been up all night reading this book. Loved it. 
"This may be my favorite Tana French book since The Likeness. So good. Compelling, riveting, and with a satisfying ending."
"Tana French knocks it out of the park again with her 6th novel. Some of the characters are the same, the crime is puzzling, and the murderer is not who you would guess. Loved it. "
"The best Tana French book yet. Truly interesting all he way through and keeps you guessing until the end. And unlike some previous French novels, this one has a satisfying ending for the reader. "
"After being disappointed by ""The Secret Place,"" I thought that this new release showed that she's back to her best self."
"Another excellent police procedural in this wonderful series. Totally drawn into this one with taut, edgy characters and sharp dialog. "
Tana French is a great writer of mysteries. Character development is solid and the story itself keeps you guessing. Can't go wrong with any of her books.
Incredibly suspenseful. Always on the edge of your seat. The interrogation parts were unbelievably written!
Wow a really good and awesome author!!!!!! Another awesome read! Fully developed story complete with story resolution. Keep up the good work!!!
"I could read 24 more books about Conway and Moran, but if I'm only getting this one, it's a hell of a good one."
"Tana French is amazing. This got a little wordy/long for me in the middle, but the ending made up for it. I can't wait for the next one."
Loved the book. It was long. But great characters with wonderful insight into the main characters in the end. Wish it would be a series. Will definitely read from from this author 
This was a really good book! Great characters and excellent story. And I listened to this on audio and the narrator was fantastic! Loved this book! Would highly recommend. 
"A first-rate police procedural whose psychological insights raise it well above the more traditional approaches in the genre.
"
One of her better ones
"I loved this book, it is set in set in Dublin and you will have some trouble with the words they use, but other than that it is a great read, great plot. Like the characters, which is always good."
First novel I've read from Tana French. Won't be the last. 
So good. I couldn't put it down.
"A tour de force
"
Tana French did not disappoint with this one. 
This book was excellent. 
This was probably as enjoyable as any of Tana French's books have been for me. They just suck me right in.
Amazing book. Long but I wouldn't remove any of it. Every bit adds color and depth to this sad but wonderful mystery. I really love the way the ending was handled.
it was an awesome story I really liked Tana French writing. 
Excellent! Tana French is back on her game with this one.
"One of the best

Gripping story. Plenty of suspense, both in the crime, in the Murder squad and between the solve team. The ending is unexpected but well keyed up in the story."
Another superb French Dublin novel. 
Excellent book as usual for the author.
LOVED IT!!! Another fabulous book that only Tana French could pull off. It's true Tana French through and through. Loved it! If you're a fan of her books then this one doesn't disappoint! 
Perfect as always.
slower start than the rest of the series. still good though
"Hard time with the beginning and then couldn't wait to finish the 16th CD! May listen again, right away because now that I know what is going on, I want to hear it again. Laughing at myself."
"If you haven't found Tana French, start at the very first ""In the Wood"" and you will not be disappointed."
"Definitely one of my favorite Tana French books so far, and I've liked them all!"
Yet another flawed but endearing protagonist from Tana French. Lots more talk than action and a little slow in the middle but still a great read.
stunning. like the rest of this series. one of my favorite fiction writers. 
"Who dunnit

Keeps you guessing This is the second book I've read Looking forward to number three Very very very very good"
"Great great writer. Engaging story, fun detective style dialogue. "
"Another excellent installment that really made me want to read them all again in in quick succession. I enjoy how the setting remains the same, but the main characters rotate."
"one of the best audiobooks I've ever listened to! the reader was simply amazing, I was completely entranced. her accents, timing, intonation... just perfect."
One of her best. I felt like I was speed reading the last few chapters! 
не перестаю восхищаться
Fantastic!
angry and dark main character...but good mystery
Last book in the series. Crossing my fingers for one more!
Highly intelligent read. Just adore this author.
I always love Tana French and this was a classic mix of human emotion and detective mystery. 
"Great book enhanced by the reader with a heavy Irish accent. a true mystery, couldn't put it down."
No one writes like Tana French. A solid addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series.
"Tana French continues to write fantastic, moody Irish mystery novels. She sticks with what she does well without seeming formulaic. Out of the three I've read this is the best so far."
Have enjoyed other Tana French books. Really liked the depth of the characterizations in this one. The back and forth suspicions regarding whodunit kept my interest piqued. 
I love to hear the audio books in this series because the readers have wonderful Irish dialects.
Terrific! The best in the series since The Likeness. 
This is by far her best book yet!
Great!
"OK. Out of all of the Dublin Murder Squad series - this HAS to be my favorite (right next to The Likeness). Honestly I love this series so much, and I am dYiNg for the next one!!!! AHHHHHHHGHHH "
"She's so amazing, consistently mind-blowing. I did get annoyed at Antoinette a bit for being a bit paranoid, but she did realize it at least at the end. Already looking forward to the next one!"
I love the world Tana has created. Another good read. 
French is back and better than ever - Trespasser makes up for any disappointments or worries about future books that her last one may have caused. One of my absolute favorites from this series.
Not sure I ever understood the title. But the book was a great beach read. Plot moved fairly quickly 
"Another winner from author Tana French. I love learning about Irish social culture as the mystery is solved.
"
Love Tana French. This is my favorite so far!! 
Character development that's second to none. 
"I love this author and love the Dublin Murder squad.
Once again, I had to clear everything from my schedule until I finished the novel."
"Top notch Tana French

Her characters are fleshed out, the story is psychologically sound, and it still takes you until the detectives figure out whodunnit for you to."
One of my favorites so far of the Dublin Murder Squad series!
Holy WOW.
I have loved every single one of the books so far! :D
"A fun, well written yarn."
"this was really excellent. Tana French never loses her edge. I thought the mystery in this one was really compelling, and I LOVED getting to see Antoinette POV. "
"Tana French does it again. She is a master story teller weaving intricate plots and convincing, unique characters. "
Holy shit was this book amazing! I couldn't put it down! I stayed up nights to finish it. Oh God. No amount of gushing about this book will do it justice. Possibly one of her best books yet.
Really hard to put down. 
"Another could-not-put-it-down from Tana French. Compelling characters, completely believable, tight, everything fits together. Can't wait for her next."
"Another great look at a flawed detective in the Dublin Murder Squad. This is her best, yet."
"All of her characters always seem so ALIVE. Even, you know, the murder victims. It makes the books so vibrant and so sad. "
Simply love Conway and Moran....and the ins and outs of all their theories of what might have happened and finally what REALLY happened...6 stars if possible!
"Like all of Tana French's books, simply excellent. Good message about not jumping to conclusions."
"The title is a bit vague but this is a great read. A female protagonist just as good, maybe better than Lisbeth Salander. Better writing than ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."""
This book had it all going on for me. I felt like I was thrust into the interrogation room along with the sweaty grit of detective life. Loved it!
At what point did I turn into a Tana French fanboy?
"1/3 of the way through, I found I couldn't stop reading. Tana French not only tells a good mystery, but the voice of her characters change each time."
My first Tana French book and I am a big fan! he dialogue has me haring the characters' voices in my head. Twists and turns with every page.
And she does it again. Please tell me the next book is already in the works... don't make me wait!!
Such a fun book to read. I love her characters and the way we get to know each one a bit more as the books progress.
Always a great listening book for the car. Thanks for a great book in the series. >^..^<
I can't say enough good about this book. Tana French wrote such a terrific story. It had me guessing the murderer all throughout. And the writing superb. Highly recommended
Kept me turning the pages and was surprised at who actually did the deed! Want to read some more about the Dublin Murder Squad.
I wish Tana French just pumped out novels.
Utterly fantastic book. A detective story with more twists and turns than you would believe. Barely put-downable. 
I love it!
I do love a good mystery and this one did not disappoint. 
"Excellent!

I could not put this book down! Loved the writing and the characters. Lots of twists and turns that left you guessing."
OUTSTANDING. In every way a good cop/murder mystery can be.
"I've read all her books and enjoyed them all: but this is the best so far. As always, deep and complicated characters, wonderful writing and a plot that seems simple but you know it isn't. "
My fave in the series since Faithful Place
I love a good unreliable narrator.
Tana French - you did it again 
All other crime fiction is shite! This girl only kills me with the dialogue.
This was riveting. The mystery was twisty. You could never tell who to trust. And I loved hard-edged Antoinette. Definitely going to read the rest of this series.
Tana French at her best. A very tautly written mystery with her usual twists and a beleveable outcome
Another brilliant Tana French novel - totally absorbing.
Tana French does it again!
"Tana French is back! I haven't loved the last few books in this series, but this one is a winner. Great characters, a good mystery, and really good dialogue. Loved it!"
I loved this one- strong female character - twist ending . Engaging - and for the most part police procedural mystery books are not my thing - but I really enjoyed this story. 
I couldn’t wait to finish this book and find out what happened. At the same time I never wanted it to end. 
Tons of twists to this one. It was a little on the long side but I enjoyed it so much I didn't care.
Loved French's latest! So atmospheric and the ending was so satisfying.
"Loved the reader! Loved the protagonist! This book had me totally engrossed! Love police procedurals, and thi s is one of the best. "
I couldn’t put it down... burned through an entire day! 
"I just finished this book, and I actually feel like I can't breathe. It got better and better and better and better and I just feel electrified."
"library, audio. good - should read the rest of them too"
"Read this book before I knew there were others in the series, lols. Hooked. Now going to find book 1 and start from there. I might just have found an author that blows me away. "
"My first book by this author, and it won’t be my last. Excellent from start to finish. Audio version has the added benefit of the gorgeous Irish lilt of narrator Hilda Fay."
**4.5 Stars**
"I really love these stories by Tana French-she gives so much insight into her characters, that I feel as if I've known them for years!"
Best Novel that I've read this year. Outstanding from start to finish. Truly rich and layered.
This book is a page turner with such excellent themes that universally apply to my life. That’s my hallmark of an excellent book.
Page turner! Could not put down . Want to read more of her books. 
"As always, good stuff."
I can't wait for book 7!
"True to form, Tana kept me guessing until the end!"
liked all her books but really enjoyed this one
"Yes, she sometimes overwrites. But you get every detail and every thought. And every book in the Dublin Murder Squad is good.
"
This is not my favorite from Tana French. But even the worst Tana French book is better than any other psychological thriller/mystery I've ever read.
What can I say? Tana French is excellent. I love every one of this literary thriller series.
"This is a fantastic crime novel! If you've not read any of Tana French's books, get started on them now."
Interesting and in suspense to the very end. 
"Amazing book, listened to it on audio & loved the narration!!"
"I enjoyed the character development and story line. The lead character, Antoinette Conway, is a strong and capable woman.
The book was hard to put down. It was a fun read."
Now I'm stuck waiting for the next book to come out!
"An excellent page-turner, with plenty of unexpected twists. It's a solid read, just like the last five in this series. "
"Some of French's other books have been better, but she tends to grab the reader, and not let go."
"Really good detective story! Almost spiritual, certainly poetic.l loved the characters, really good voices, I so appreciated the plot."
"Loved this book. When I finish a book and I miss the characters, it's a 5 star book for me."
"Excellent mystery, both the case and the inside of Conway’s head. "
Solid. Excellent. Everything I expect from a Tana French novel. 
This book was absolutely amazing. Tana French puts amazing twists into her stories. They capture you and hold you captive until the last page is turned. 
"A repeat with D's Conroy and Moran. Four possible scenarios, no hard evidence to back any of them up. This one shows French to be a master of the genre. "
I can't wait until she writes another book!
"Took awhile because it is long, and I checked it out from the library. But worth the wait. Great book!"
Simply love her books!
Another great detective story!!! how does she have all these different voices in her head ! I hope there is another one soon
"Excellent

The best of French yet...I love the partnership in the Murder squad of Antoinette and Steve. Hope we see more of them soon."
Can I give this 6 stars?
I just love this series. So enjoyable to read.
"Tana French, you are a marvellous writer! "
Loved this book! The voice helped me really get into the mind of the main character. It was just a great read!
Love her books! Start with her first book if possible but not necessary.
Loved this book. Perhaps my favorite Tana French yet. Oh please please come out with another book soon! 
"A crime novel with...

lots of introspection and internal dialogue, and still a good mystery to untangle. Her books are a cut above the usual crime story. Highly recommend."
"Just finished reading this book for the second time, and it was still a page turner. I have read all of Tana French's books and loved all of them. "
"Entertaining

Great read for police mystery lovers. Told from the detectives inside point of view. Fun British slang and references throughout."
"That was a great ride! I've enjoyed all of the previous five, some more than others, but this one ranks with the best in the series. "
This is an excellent mystery series. Complex plots with interesting characters that are flawed but realistic. All books in this series are highly recommended. 
Best Tana French book yet! 
Great mystery with lots of different layers of complexity. Very satisfying conclusion.
"It took me a while to like this one. The protagonist is pretty difficult, but ultimately she grew on me, and I was pretty satisfied with the ending."
"Great book

Tana French never disappoints. Keeps you guessing right up to the end. Can’t wait to read her next Dublin adventure"
"I enjoyed this book, the mystery and the story line - it kept me guessing until the end. I wish the protagonist wasn't so angry. It gets old."
How am I done all six Dublin Murder Squad books? So badly hope there’s more to come
Tana French continues to kill it time after time. Another great Dublin Murder Squad book.
Tana French never disappoints.
"Detailed, thoughtful, intriguing and character-driven. A superb mystery!"
I adore Tana French's novels and this may be one of my favorites. I listened to it on audio book and I do think that added to the experience of this story. 
"Great Crime Thriller

Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Battled to put it down. Many twist and turns building the suspense. Tana French does not disappoint. Highly recommended."
Great story with a great finish!
I love these. I need to find more on audiobook... brushing up on that South Dublin accent
So smart - maybe my favorite Tana French yet. 
Tana French has done it again!! I love coming back to these series because French never disappoints.
Stayed up until the wee smalls to finish! Haven’t done that in a long time! Twisty!
"If you enjoy a thinking police criminal mystery, this is for you."
Another compelling piece by Tana French!!
Want inside a female cops head while hunting a murderer? This is the novel for you. 
"I love Tana French’s books! Like the others, I couldn’t put this one down. She kept me guessing until the very end. "
"l hate coming to the end of a Tana French book!

This review essentially says all you need to know: Review by Emily May: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
"what a fantastic writer!!! Tana French does it again. if you want a good mystery, great police work and some Irish history..... check out her books!!"
I love Tana French!
Love this series. Love her books!
"This was a long read for me. Not keen on lengthy chapters as I like to bookmark a completed one.
Lots of red herrings and twists and turns, just loved it. They make a good team."
the audio book is so much fun with the Irish Brogue and all. . . . . SPOILER ALERT: I did a serious LOL when she's describing a guy's accent . . . .hope you find it funny too.
"Wow!!

Loved it !! Good. Plot can't wait to read the next one from Tan a and always keeps us guessing"
This book felt really real. Full of awesome observations that you would expect from the POV of a detective. Kept me guessing the whole way! 
"She has out done herself this time!

This go round the twists and turns were even more surprising than usual. She really reached a new level. Brilliant.
"
4.5. Best since The Likeness
"Solid Read

Very solid plot line and a very entertaining read. Almost as fun as the first in the series and makes me want to read the next one"
No one gets you inside the head of the characters like Tana French. She’s amazing and this book was no exception. I’m not a big fan of Detective Conway and this was still one of her best IMO.
Holy... shit
LOVE Tana French!
Listened to this one and couldn’t turn it off. It’s a stream of consciousness tale. Great characters. Wonderful language. 
I have loved all Tana French's books so far and this one did not disappoint. The characters are believable and flawed and the plot is moves along quickly. Can't wait to read her latest The Witch Elm!
Best one yet. So intricate/intriguing/impossible to put down. ❤️Antoinette Conway.
"As with all Tana French novels I really loved this. Couldn't stop reading it, loved the twists, was gutted when it was over."
"Another amazing, gripping, thrilling mystery from Tana French. I listened to the audiobook and Hilda Fay’s narration was impeccable. "
"My favourite one of the series so far, a cracking read."
So fucking good. I blew through the last 100 pages in a flash. Couldn’t stop! 
"Tightly plotted, crisp prose, and my favorite Murder Squad narrator yet. I held my breath with every twist and turn."
Fantastic 
Loved the characters.
I was a bit weary after reading “The Secret Place” but this is back to the Tana French I love! 
Another Dublin Murder Squad mystery where Tana French hits it out of the park. 
"Spot on, top of genre style. Love the character development!"
Tana French is a badass genius. 
"Tana French's fearless ability to write a female protagonist, accurately and no-holds-barred, is a thing to behold. Fantastic."
Tana French is the best mystery writer I've read since I discovered Agatha Christie in junior high.
I just love the Dublin Murder Squad and I especially adored listening to this one. The accents are wonderful and the reader was amazing.
"Finishing this series feels like completing some intense journey that I didn't know I was on. If you haven't read these, you need to start. "
The best one of this series! Wirklich wahnsinnig spannend und toll geschrieben!
"I enjoyed the psychological complexity.

The reader for he audio book was superb."
wow - tana french has completely redeemed herself in my eyes. this one is so criss-crossed and has me doubting what i am sure i nkow. great job and a fascinating read
"Excellent read. Very good character insight, interesting plot, and. Dry. Dry well written. French is an excelkNt author."
Another excellent take on the Dublin Murder Squad.
Intriguing and perfectly creepy.
"Tana French is so good at writing complex novels around murder mysteries. Full, flawed characters make their way through the story, trying to make sense of themselves and the world around them. "
I’m hooked 
Loved the depth of the main character. 
I haven't read any of the other books in this series or books by this author but I enjoyed this very much. Excellent for this genre. 
"Incredibly good, favorite book in recent memory! This whole series by Tana French is amazing!"
Classic Tana French. Intricate developed plot and the expected hard but anxious interplay between characters.
Wish I could give it six stars!
"Great dialogue, a modern fun version of the old hardboiled detective. "
"Great mystery with twists, turns, and surprises. Good summary on Goodreads."
Continues to be one of my favorite authors. Well written and she keeps you guessing till the end. 
Love Tana French’s style! Have read all her books and she never fails to write a good one. yes 
"Excellent as usual for Tana French.

French never disappoints and I never quite know where the story will end up but it's always so well done."
"I really enjoyed every aspect of this book, including the narration of the audiobook."
Excellent! I don't want the Dublin Murder Squad series to end! There has to be more!!
My favorite of this series.
Loved this one! a murder investigation is hampered by the very ones called to solve it!
"Definitely a return to form for this series, at least as far as I'm concerned. Loved it, though I understand why some readers might not warm up to Conway as the protagonist."
Best Dublin Murder Squad in awhile - fantastic read for Tara French fans!
"Another excellent mystery by Tana French that delves into the psychology of detectives, suspects, witnesses, and victims. Every book she writes is worth a read. "
"Pretty good Irish police procedural. This was the first book of this series I read, which seemed just fine."
"dayumm!!!!!

I couldn't put this down. This is a must read. it will keep you guessing until the end and the end is great."
My fave in the series. Paranoia. 
"Great character build up, intrigue, and delivery of plot. The cadence of writing is well suited to the events. Well told story, witty and tough characters, great addition to this genre."
Superb - a great mystery read. Wonderfully written.
Best of the series so far. 
Wonderful...sad this is the last one
"Good

Good I think you should check your all the way out there for you and you should check out this book for free"
"oh
my
god

this one is so fuckin good. I love Antoinette more than any narrator we've read from French yet."
I love all of Tana French's books!
"Clever plot

The story is original and fast paced. I haven’t read such a page turning police procedural in a long time."
Good book keeps you interested! Not what I was expecting
"I’ve been reading so many quick and dirties lately that this meaty thriller was a welcome respite. Complicated characters, tight plot, great Irish slang. So fun to read."
"As far as I'm concerned, Tana French can do no wrong."
"Tana French, you amaze me. "
Even better to listen on CD. The accent of the reader takes you to Dublin.
"Excellent suspense-mystery in a Dublin environment. Great characters, narration and plot twists."
Half way through this I knew I was either going to be very happy with the ending or severely disappointed. It went the way I favored. Now I want a follow up!
Good 
"Compelling

Great characterization of the narrator. A twisty plot that keeps you guessing. Great atmospheric detail of a particular place. Kept me reading almost non-stop to the end."
My new favourite author! I love all the books in this series.
"Absolutely wonderful writing once again. Great story up until the end, twists and wrong leads. Enjoyed this one as almost all of Tana French's books. Can't wait to read the next."
"A rare five stars from me. This was superb. A very unusual murder mystery, with elements of conspiracy swirling around the Murder Squad. Tana French seems to be getting better and better. Read it. "
Good twists!
One of the things I love about this series is the complex characters. I think the characters are actually more important to the story than the story. I’m sad to have finished the series. 
Wow - could not put this one down
I think this might be my favourite of the series.
Good characters and an interesting plot full of twists.
Great story! Her detail is so real. You can really understand the characters. You can picture their movements and feel their motions.
Loved it & can't wait to read more of this series
"Loved it. Am I the only one who started telling everyone I'm off to the ""jacks"" all the time now? Good pacing, great dialogue."
Is anyone really surprised I'm giving Tana French book 5 star review?
I love this series. You just get lost in the characters!
"I think this was Tana’s best yet. There was a gritty realness to this one, with her most vibrant protagonist yet. I’ll have chills for days. "
Wonderful!
"Maybe the best one of her Dublin Murder Squad series. Not sure, but love this writer.
"
Superlative story telling in the 6th offering in the Dublin Murder Squad series.Very highly recommended!
These books just get better and better. French does human complexity so well. 
Excellent - one of the best murder stories I have read in a long time
A smart book that kept me guessing with nuanced characters. 
Just finished. Enjoyed the listen a lot! Well thought out and plausible. Love the Irish accents and characters. Very good.
Wowwww
"One of the best books I’ve read in recent memory. So well written, fantastic character development, great dialogue, amazing plot. Read it."
Loved it! Tana French is my favourite living mystery writer. 
"Кажется, это моя любимая книга из серии. Идеальный детектив "
A page-turner and exceptional writing for the genre. I loved learning Irish slang along the way.
Great detective book with a great detective team. Really enjoyed watching the story unfold. Really loved this whole series. 
Excellent entry to the series.
I love her books! She’s superb at setting a mood. I feel like I’m there. 
"very, very, very wordy but good"
Excellent Irish mystery! 
excellent mystery/psychological thriller. 
"On a cruise ship, champagne and fine food waiting and I can’t put down this book. Ms. French in top form always but this was superb. "
Deep and dark in Dublin.
"Best entry yet, with multiple twists, denouements, and moments of tension and release. Conway's character was occasionally typed too obviously, but it all balanced out in the end. A+ crime fiction."
Outstanding police procedural mystery ... I can’t wait to read others in the series.... and this is NOT a genre I am usually drawn toward! It appears each book features different detectives.
"Read the series in order, all excellent, top mystery writer with well developed characters, her books great as literature, mysteries should get better standing,"
"Audiobook. Library borrow. January 2020.
Turns out this is book #6 in the Dublin Murder series."
I love Tana French! Her characters are compelling and truthful constructions. Her stories are consistently well written and powerful. Highly recommend! 
Suspenseful to the very end. The best of the Dublin Murder Squad series. 
Tana French writes amazing mysteries! I stayed up way too late reading this multiple nights because I couldn't put it down. 
"Good!

Good stuff, kept me going the whole way. The proverbial page turner. I need eight more words. Here they are"
Super good!!
I love the twists and turns Tana French writes! She does great plots without relying on lurid sex or violence. 
"A slow start, but otherwise excellent. Antoinette is such a great character.

I really enjoyed this entire series and definitely stan Tana French now."
My favourite of French's Dublin Murder Squad series so far. 
This kept me up until 4 am reading. Highly recommended.
Might be my favorite one yet! Ending was surprisingly satisfying and Conway is such a compelling character. “Fair play to ya” Tana French!😂
I don't want it to end!! Is there a Book #7 in the works?
Great female detective novel! Now I need to read the previous ones. 
"Not my favorite of her storylines but writing is a feeling and mood, and always exceptional."
"Amazingly good. She has always been good (except for the Likeness which is not credible). A tight plot that is linear and easy to follow, yet gripping all the way to the end. The best detective book I have read in a long while."
"So good, I can’t wait to read the rest! Some good characterization. Excellent cop story."
Favorite of her book yet.
"Had a hard time getting into it at first, probably became I was so busy that I had to keep putting it down. But in the end I really enjoyed it."
Tana French was brilliant in creating this 20+hour audiobook that I devoured. It was too long with so much detail but it all worked out. Hilda Fay was an incredible narrator.
"So good. So different from the last one. She does such a good job of writing from her character’s point of view, and making you see the world the way they do.

Kept me guessing all the way along."
Best one in the series yet!
Tana French is the master of the detective procedural. Absolute enjoyment!
"Love this author, for the detail and complexity of the stories."
"Loved it. I have found my new series. Unfortunately, I apparently didn’t start at the beginning. But.... that happens! Loved the writing and loved the narrator. "
French. Nailed. It. 
Sad to see the series end. Good that it’s on a high note. 
"Read this series in order. This is my favourite book. A solid five-star read. The story flows so well, and I love the interviews between detectives and witnesses. "
Really liked the main character. A hard bitch. Relatable.
"There is slot of dialogue, and it moves a bit slow in the middle. Solid ending!"
"Spectacular, the absolute best in the series."
She writes PERFECT murder mysteries 
One of the most absorbing reads I've had in a long time. I was seething with anger for most of the book. I ended up having to stay up until 2 in the morning to find out how it ended. No regrets. 
That was a ride to say the least. loved it. 
"I really enjoyed this one. The main character is fully realized, and the story is wonderful puzzle."
Tana French...you are amazing. I love this book series and I am sad that I am finished because there is not another book to dive into headfirst. October seems so far away to wait for The Searcher.
Another great book from Tana French. I've now read everything published by her. Can't wait for the next whenever that might be. 
"In the sixth installment of her Dublin Murder Squad series, author Tana French again focuses on Detectives Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway as she did in the preceding book, The Secret Place. This time, however, the story is narrated by Conway, rather than Moran. Conway continues to struggle with sexism on the Squad, and as her partner, Moran shares a dose of her pariah status. The two of them are coming off another soul-killing night shift, when they catch what looks like a domestic murder - a young woman named Aislinn Murray has been found dead in her apartment, the victim of what appears to be a crime of passion.

There's a ready-made suspect - her boyfriend, Rory - and even a ready-made motive: Aislinn appears to have been seeing someone else, as well. But something's not quote right. Conway and Moran's boss has insisted that they cover the case, when it would normally have gone to the day shift; Aislinn's apartment has been systematically scrubbed clean of forensic evidence - not the kind of thing that usually happens after a hot-blooded boyfriend snaps; and one of the Squad's top detectives has been assigned to the case, as well, ostensibly to provide experience and guidance, but also so the boss can keep an eye on him. On top of all that, someone is leaking material to the press to make Conway look bad, and she's spotted a prowler near her apartment on more than one occasion.

Conway is at the end of her rope, teetering on the edge of abandoning the only job she's ever wanted and taking a position with a private security firm. Her pride and her partnership with Moran have been the only thing holding her to the Squad. As the two of them work the case, their desire to have something meaty to solve leads them down unexpected paths - some productive and others not - and the added strain, the belief that this might be their only shot, has Conway starting to believe that she has nothing left to prove to anyone and that it's time to move on.

As she is wont to do, French mines both the past and present to produce a beautifully written, whip-smart, character-driven mystery. The Dublin Murder Squad books are aptly described as melancholy or bittersweet, with gains balanced - and sometimes outweighed - by losses, but The Trespasser contains elements of redemption and hope. Conway and Moran will have reasons to believe they've made a difference in the end, and that optimism for the future just might not be unfounded."
So good! I love the characters she is able to create and how good they are together. 
"From what I remember, this was a good book. I haven't been on this site since December of 2016. I'm going to try and read a little faster this time."
Had to read all Tana French's books! Enjoy every single minute I spend on her nooks.
Great book! Love that it takes place in Ireland. 
"4.5. Отлично - самую малость слабоватая детективная линия с лихвой окупается отличным, четким и очень связным повествованием. Ещё хочу!"
A rare 5 stars from me! Loved this- totally gripping. Good plot well written. Brilliant.
"I wait months between Tana French novels because they're so intense. This one was worth the wait. Another outstanding book, a police procedural with gripping characters and a fine, treacherous path from beginning to end."
I think this is Tanna's best of the series!
I have thoroughly enjoyed the entire Dublin Murder Squad series. This one was my favorite! Love Conway. Love Moran. Good stuff.
As good as the first one in the series. 
Another glorious read from one of my favorite authors!!!
Absolutely loved this!
"VERY GOOD. Supposedly listened to the audiobook three years ago, have literally no memory of this. "
Rounded up from 4.5
"I’d have to say this is the best of the Dublin Murder Squad that I’ve read so far, they’ve all been really good but this was brilliant and very exciting."
Impossible to put down.
Ирландская полиция. Девушка убита перед ужином с новым молодым человеком 
"I just love Tana French. Especially her female protagonists. Solid detective, “who done it” mystery for a dreary Fall week. "
"A fast read with strong character work and an even stronger narrative voice, all held together by a great mystery. "
"Perfectly-crafted, tense, unputdownable. I loved Antoinette as a character and the interview scenes were outstanding. "
"Tana French books are fierce, beautifully crafted, and consuming. The Trespasser is thrilling even if it didn’t involve murder."
"Fabulous!!

I have read every book in this series and this one is so so great!!! Can’t wait for the next one!!!"
Tana French writes a great crime novel. I couldn't put it down. I loved the character development and the plot development. 
"Another fantastic book by Tana French! She grabs me and doesn't let go. And when I am finished, I can't let go. "
"These Tana French books. I eat them in one day.
Thanks, mom!"
So great that I bought the whole Dublin murders boxed set! The plot kept me guessing until the last pages and the characters were so richly developed that I couldn’t put it down! Well done!
A brilliant and deep dive into the Dublin Murder Squad. 
"Snarky, suspenseful and enigmatic. Kept me guessing and turning pages. Love French’s style, plot twists and her characters. Brilliant. Can’t wait to read her other books. "
"Great read, kept me hooked. Now getting more Tana French - love her style."
"My first book of 2020. Compelling, absorbing, driving. Tana French at her best."
"Tana French is an eloquent, lyrical writer. She can weave a poetic world within a single paragraph."
This book had so many twists and turns that I couldn’t see the end coming. I hope this isn’t the last book in the series. 
Possibly the best of the series?
"I really, really loved this series. This last one was terrific. Really wish the series would continue."
"I love Tana French, keeps you guessing through the whole book!! Can't wait to read more about the Dublin Murder Squad, feels like I'm there!!"
"Having been so disappointed with the author’s last book, I was delighted to see this was the level I was used to from her. An excellent read and hope there is another murder squad in the pipeline.
"
Twists! Excellent
This is the first book I have read by Tana French but it will not be the last! I had a difficult time putting it down. Highly recommend 
"I'm not usually super into mysteries, but I wish there was a special 6-star rating just for Tana French books."
"Tana French not only provides a mystery with twists and turns, but she develops the detectives as real people who must deal with their own inner worlds."
5 stars for character dialogue! French is incredible. Great story too.
Brilliant writing with a satisfying ending. I loved every minute of this. French has such an ear for dialog.
A good 4.5 stars. Impressed. Last 100 pages flew by.
La pluma de Tana French es fascinante. La manera de describir todo hasta conseguir introducirte de lleno en la historia es increíble.
"i was really frustrated in the beginning of the book, mostly because antoinette herself is so frustrated, but my god the last third of this book!!!!!!! "
Brilliant.
"I was hooked immediately, couldn't put it down!"
"I'm starting to think it's Tana French's thing to make me sure I hate a book halfway through before getting me to do a full, can't put it down 180 in the back half. This one was no exception."
A good look into the challenges of becoming a female leader in a murder squad. 
I LOVED this. couldn't put it down. devastated it's the last of the Dublin Murder Squad series. hoping there'll be another someday!!
"What a great series, gutted it's over. This was a return to form after the letdown of The Secret Place. Glad French can do a happy ending when the situation calls for it."
"Love Tana French’s books!

What a great read! Finished it in one day, because it has short chapters, and you just can’t put it down!"
This book was outstanding! What a great series. I feel like I just got off a really good roller coaster. What a ride!!! I only regret that it's over!
I always love a good Tana French book. I really enjoyed the evolution of the characters and what they find out about themselves. Quite a few psychological twists and turns for the characters!
"Very good story in spite of the occasionally whiny MC. At least she seemed whiny to me, but others may not agree. "
Its a masterpiece.

This one is right back up with books 1 and 2 for me. 
I love a dirty cop story
Superb reading by Hilda Fay.
I'm sad this is the last Dublin Murders book...I've loved the series.
I love this series. This was my favorite book so far. The interrogations were a bit lengthy and difficult to get through but the plot was great as were the characters.
I have enjoyed all of the Dublin Murder Squad books. This is more of the same. Character study.
Stellar main character
"Great!

Took forever to read but continued to occupy my thoughts even when it had to be checked back into the library. Recommend setting aside the time to read right off the bat."
I am ready for the next Tana French Dublin Murder Squad mystery. I am a fan.
"Tightly plotted mystery told from the point of view of a character who comes across as unlikable at first but then grows more sympathetic as the layers are revealed.
"
I thought this was the best book in the series. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it. 
Great story. I do love all of her books!
"I love this whole series and am amazed it took me so long to start reading them. Beautifully atmospheric, well plotted, great characters. Might want an Urban Dublin dictionary handy at times. "
"The Irish narrator, Hilda Fay, was pure joy to listen to and really added to enjoyment of the story. "
This was amazing to listen to with the Irish accents and dialect. Can't wait to listen to another Tana French novel!
Great wrap up to the series
"For me, a rare book - all I wanted to do was read this - in the middle of the night, during lunch, dinner, etc. Wonderful!"
"*chef’s kiss* Conway really grew on me, so sad I’ve reached the end of this series (so far, HOPEFULLY)."
"I really enjoyed this audiobook, especially with the accents. The characters and story line were fun to follow. I love the female detective, she’s kick-ass! "
"The best in the series so far. So tightly written, the characters nuanced. "
"A haunting, paranoia-inducing story about the stories we tell ourselves. "
"Great book

This story started off a little slow but once it got you I couldn't put it down. Loved the twists!"
This one may have been my favorite! Please write more of this dynamic duo. 
"Classic who done it, and of course there is a twist."
Excellent Murder Squad book! I hope this isn't really the last. We need more!!
"I really enjoyed the main character, she's definitely in my protagonist sweet spot. I loved the dialogue scenes in the book and the doubt, paranoia, and zingers enmeshed in the dialogue."
This kept me entertained throughout. I was sad to finish it!
So good! My favorite Dublin Murder squad book so far. 
"Really top notch. Wish I'd read #5 first for the D's characters. Regardless, very, very enjoyable. "
"A masterpiece and joy to read. Bittersweet, but this was a very satisfying final book in the series. "
"I’ve read her other Murder Squad books, and loved them all. But this is the best story yet. Hopefully another one is in the works."
"A terrific read. Plenty of twists and turns, interesting characters and a great story."
"Excellent as usual

Good detective story. I almost always enjoy Tana French novels. The characters are interesting because they are flawed so they are never one dimensional."
"Amazing, what a ride. Read this literally every spare second I could. Highly enjoyable with an awesome badass protagonist !!"
Great series!
Brilliant!!
Like any other Tana French books. Slow start to an under the calm surface mystery. 
"Really excellent!

Loved this book from beginning to end. Characters were well drawn. Story line made sense and had some nice twists and turns. Highly recommend."
"Another great mystery

I loved this series! Tana French does a great job with dialogue and layered, oh-so-flawed characters. Great finish!! It was highly satisfying."
Tana French never disappoints. 
"I had to give this book 5 stars since the series was so fantastic. Tana French is an amazing writer — characterization, plot, dialogue, atmosphere — she does it all so well. "
The Best one yet !
"Spectacular. Sorry to have finished it :(
One of my favorite reads this year."
Really enjoyed this whole series. Great reads in my gazebo on beautiful summer days. French writes beautifully and I am happy that I went back to find all her books.
Kept me guessing!
"Excellent….plot, characters, writing…"
I love Detective Conway and think she should have her own TV show or book spinoff. She and Detective Moran made a great team.
I loved this mystery. Just can’t imagine how the author thinks up all the plot twists and turns.
i fvcking love tana french 
"I was a bit distracted.....you know....life.
But I still love Tana French. I got into near the end.
Still phenomenal writng"
I listened to this story over the Libby app. The person reading it had the perfect accent which just made the story so much more then if I had been reading it. 
Excellent crime fiction writing Never disappoints ...especially the interrogations!
"This time did it as an audiobook. (I read print version some years back.) Terrific. Great characterization. I really love the Dublin Murder Squad books, but I fear this is the last of them.
"
"Great read

I really like The Trespasser. It has just the right number of twists and turns. Another great book by Tara French."
"Best one of all the Dublin crime, but they were all very good"
Long journey of a book but well worth the read. An Interesting in depth detective story. Very well written and characters are great. Have enjoyed all of Tana French’s books!
Love this book-- so well written
4.5
I really enjoy Tana French’s books and this one is a standout from the six I’ve read so far. I like the detective /protagonist and the plot had me guessing for a long time. I wish I had keep a notebook of all the great Irish expressions that show up in her books. You can’t go wrong with Tana French.
9/10
Story deserves more than 5 stars.
So good. Conway and Moran investigate a murder that becomes stickier and has more dead ends as the days wear on. They come to the conclusion that it is all over for them as detectives.
5 for the genre -love her characters - I can see every scene on the big screen
"It took me a while to get the situation clear, but once I did it was unputdownable and had twists and turns that had me processing everything again and again."
Team Conway + Fleas
"Surprise twists & turns

A right rollicking bollixing! I'm only just gobsmacked at the shite that hits the fan on this story. Banjaxed, the lot of em!!!"
"A binge worthy book. So well written, you can’t stop reading, your eyes just won’t lift off the pages. "
I'm hoping there will be other entries in this series. Each and every episode is unique and intriguing. Highly recommended.
Honestly just want to go back and read this series again. It was that good.
"I really enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad series - can recommend this book too, especially for the mind-bending second-guessing itself plot. "
Loved it as much as the others in the series. Hope Tana French will write more of them!
"Another fantastic read by Tana French! I have really enjoyed the books with female protagonists, and have been watching her website like a hawk for her next publication. I hope it comes soon!"
"4.5*. Great read, slow but steady. Tana French knows how to craft a compelling police procedural. 👍🏻👍🏻"
Great detective novel 
Simply impossible to put down.
4.5*
Fabulous. Best of all. 
"I’ve liked every Tana French book I’ve read. This has great, richly detailed characters and a twisting plot that takes you on a wild ride. "
I enjoy her police procedural novels very much.
This book had me begging for resolve by the end. Kept you guessing the whole way through.
Incredible. Everything Tana French writes is gold. I’m just worried I might be nearly out of her works!
What a happy day to realize there are more Dublin Murder Squad books I haven’t read and this might have been the best one yet. 
"once again no crumbs, no notes, no survivors. tana french is on another level as always and i am GRATEFUL every time i read one of her books. more of these two please!!"
za mna zatial najlepsia z celej serie...
I love the rhythm of her books. She pulls you into a story and weaves you around till the end. Just love her writing style!
The best one?!?!? Somehow I love Antoinette Conway more than Cassie… and it ended hard but not dark. 
Encapsulates chilling homicide with the heartbreak of being a teenager. Another appearance by the wonderfully interesting Frank Mackey. 
"Tana French is a fabulous storyteller. I can't pull myself away once I start, and she finds surprising angles and keeps me guessing until the end."
Love her writing. Want to read all of her books now. 
Gotta love Dublin Murder Squad!!
"Me ha gustado mucho, en general todos los de esta saga.Esas implicaciones de los protagonistas en la historia le dan un buen toque a las novelas.Leído diciembre 2022/enero 2023.Valoración 9/10."
"Good Book

Lots of twists and turns. It makes you think back to parts you've read to see how the plot changes and then back again. I enjoyed the psychological portions to sort out."
I am so sad that she didn't write any more in this series. I loved every book.
she’s so me bc she thinks the world is against her for no reason <3
I love Tana French so much it hurts
Great close to the series! A police investigation that had me hooked from the very beginning. An excellent reveal told not a moment too soon! 
"Complicated twisty plot, characters with changing stories, set in Ireland."
"Тоже одна из интересных истории, которая держит в напряжение. Антуаннета и Стив - одна из моих любимых парочек. "
"Honestly, my favorite so far. Gripping, well written, amazing themes, believable story, can't say enough good."
read
So good! It sucked me in. Really enjoyed the main character and the story. Wish I’d read the other ones in the series first (but you don’t have to; it’s just a few references to previous events).
Utterly riveting 
What a ride! I could not put this one down. Terrific story with plenty of twists.
GOD what a way to end the series
"French has done it a gain. She is a master at developing characters, crafting a story, building suspense, and delivering a devastating resolution. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!"
Excellent mystery. Kept me in suspense throughout the book.
I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I'm new to Tana French and am now a fan.
I love all her books. It’s a page turner and not predictable. Highly recommend 
This was my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries. Tana French writes beautiful prose in addition to crafting great characters and plots. I would love to see inspector Antoinette Conway again. But maybe French is done with this series and has moved on. I will try some of her other books. 
INSANE ending and also so real to the times. SHE ADDRESSED POLICE CORRUPTION LETS GO
Lots and lots of twists! Loved it.
Best one yet!!! I thought I knew for sure who the killer was but the ending totally surprised me. Loved it.
Sad there are no more left in this series
Loveloveloveloveloooove tana french. This one was such a sweet good look at the dangers of people-pleasing
This one absolutely rips. Antoinette Conway is a complete wagon and I truly couldn't put it down
I love this series! The twists and turns of this book were fantastic. 
All 8 of her books are very good. This might be the best of the bunch.
"Inevitably, after years of careful delay, I have finished the Dublin Murder Squad series. Am I sad? Yes. Was this a fantastic book? Also yes. "
4.5 stars rounded up
I can’t stand Antoinette Conway - she is as whiny as the people she swears annoy her. But this may be the best book in the series. 
Mrs. French never disappoints!
Such good story telling. 
"Tana French, you genius you; I hope this is not the end of the Dublin Murder Squad, because I...am bereft"
"I have loved every book in the series, with this one as a possible favorite. This one might be my favorite. The characters are so well developed, with complexity and depth. . "
"so unbelievably good. tightly plotted, thematically sound, delicious from start to finish. antoinette conway is my wife "
The best Tana French yet. 
"A really satisfying read on so many levels: writing, character development, plot twists, grittiness. I couldn’t put it down. Apparently it is part of a series, but this stands alone just fine. "
"I really enjoyed this book. A rare 5 star read for me. Tana French fully develops her characters, flaws and all. "
"As always, engaging & with real depth of characters. I need something to distract me and this was perfect"
Loved this book! Couldn’t put it down once I started. 
I love the dialect. Very good Detective novel
By far my favorite of the Dublin murder squad!! I loved this book I couldn’t put it down! 
I love tana French 
Not sure what more there is to say. I love these novels. 
4.5 rounded up
"Oh right, that’s what 5 stars is "
Always enjoyable
"Another 5 star book from Tana French. I just adore her writing style, character development and intrigue I always get with the case! "
"Loved! Great mystery, love Antoinette as a protagonist and her relationship with Stephen."
This was the first book of the Dublin Murder Squad that I read! Very entertaining! Tana French knows how to keep readers up until the middle of the night! Couldn’t put it down!
Reading The Dublin Murder Squad books is like a master class in psychology -- sometimes abnormal psychology. 
"This was excellent. I did miss hearing from Moran, but I felt like he was true to the character established in The Secret Place and that helped me see where Antoinette was misunderstanding him. I also loved the way Aislinn and Antoinette were both mirrors and foils for each other. Just brilliant."
"Conway is perhaps my favorite of the detectives. Snarky, sharp women who don't have time for BS are my catnip. And she is paired perfectly with Stephen, the guy everyone likes and who we know from The Secret Place.

A brilliant book that is riveting (I devoured it in two days)."
This ate
In which Tana Franch has determined she's especially good at writing interview scenes so let's be having a lot of that.
"My favourite detective murder series, consistent if anything."
"wow. Goodness, one helluva story and characters and twists. wow."
I could read at least 10 more books in this series... Shame there's only six of them.
Tana French books are on another level. Every character has depth and their motivation is always complex and rooted in a thoroughly well plotted story. Highly recommend anything this author writes. 
Lots of twists but the truth is very clear at the end. 
Tana French tiene un talento nato para manipular tu mente a su gusto y hacerte adicto al proceso. Una maestra del thriller.
Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad never disappoint! 
Absolutely riveting. The most impressive thing about French as a writer is how she can take marginally likeable characters and make them wholly sympathetic.
"loved this one!

So much self analysis mixed with solving the murder. Glad she didn’t leave,there are always more crimes to solve, aren’t there??"
Couldn’t put it down!
Another book tied for BEST READ OF THE YEAR!!!
Sad to have finished this series!!! But wow what an amazing journey!!
Possibly my favorite of the DMS series. Her writing is just so beautiful. 
"Great mystery, complex, engaging and surprising. "
"This is one of the best books in my life.
Thank you, Tana."
"Oh man. That was a good one. Complex, engaging, gritty and emotional. I look forward to reading her next book. "
"This is a fantastic book. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. It uses modern language, has many surprises, and has engaging narration."
"Loved it. As usual, Tana French delivers. "
"Excellent, as usual"
"Loved it... Again... Tana French is officially my favourite :)
"
"Maybe her best yet. Compelling characters, crackling dialogue, convincing story. Highly recommend. "
"Loved this. Loved, loved, loved it. Just a roller coaster ride of goodness. "
Possibly my favorite of the series. 
most gripping novel yet! But they are all great...
"All her stuff is great, including this one."
"Obsessed with every book she writes, and this was no exception!"
Flat-out five stars!  Superb.
Peak Tana French.
Tana French is brilliant
Fantastic. 
so good! tana french never disappoints
A real page turner...impossible to put down!
Loved it. Absolutely couldn't put it down. 
Made me want to re-read all the Dublin Murder Squad books.
"After putting out a few duds, Tana French has her A-game back."
excellent
I am a bit biased as I've always loved her novels. This one had some very good relationship reflections/insights. Hope she writes another very soon!
"Conway and Moran together again and apparently against the entire murder squad. There's a murder and it's a mystery especially because some people seem awfully anxious to bring it quickly to the obvious conclusion. Sure, it's a police procedural but, as always with Tana French, it's so much more. Many twists in the plot but it feels like real life, not a fictional construct; and so atmospheric I felt paranoid on Antoinette's behalf. I wish I could give it ten stars."
spectacular
"Loved this book, just the right amount of mystery and twists. Very enjoyable read."
"couldn't put it down

I've read all of her books, and each one is different. I couldn't put this one down. It is that good. I got a impatient with some of internal dialogue midway through, but realized that's just how you feel when you are being Gaslighted at work. Been there, done that. Excellent storytelling."
"I'd give this book more than 5 stars if I could. This is one book where everything works together perfectly. The characters, the dialogue, the storyline. All flawless. I've read all of Tana French's novels, and loved them all. This one is the best. "
"Really LOVED this audiobook! Loved her prior novel Into the Woods and this was even better. Liked the reader and the Irish accent - really contributed to the experience. Well written, suspenseful with some humor thrown in. Some of it was a little tedious (the interviews, etc.) but I suspect this is realistic and it really walks you through how a detective thinks about a case and the process involved. Plan to read more!"
"This is a not a genre I would typically pick up to read, although I love UK mysteries on TV (Broadchurch a huge favorite), but I read it on the advice of DH, an avid reader of the genre. I loved it and was hooked from page one. The voice of Antoinette Conway is well done and believable. The red herrings are well-executed. I am already in the queue for #1 in this series. "
I really love Tana French and was delighted to find this latest DMS book on Kindle. Now I am waiting for the next one!
"Another brilliant crime mystery from Tana French. The writing transcends the mystery/crime genre and truly enters the realm of great literature. The writing is more than just a good plot. The characters are complex and the story unwraps in a way that reminds me of Agatha Christie or Louise Penney. This is a truly gifted writer who will pull you into the story and not let go until the final page has been read. The Trespasser sees the return of Detective Conway and Detective Moran from the Secret Place...trying to solve a murder that should be slam dunk...its' always the boyfriend, right? But what if there's more than one boyfriend? Add to the complication, Detective Conway isn't exactly popular with her squad...so are they out to get her or is just paranoid? Are they trying to cover something up or just hoping to make a fool out of her so that she quits? This was a smart and twisty mystery that can definitely be read as part of the series or as a standalone. Everyone has a story in this novel...the question is, whose story is the true story?

I received a copy from the Penguin First to Read program in exchange for an honest review."
Another excellent book by Tana French! What a great writer!
"Another Stellar Story

I stay up so late reading her books! I love how in depth the characters are and how quick paced the action is. Can't wait till the next one."
"Audio version is marvelous. I'm a slang lover so especially high marks, and I love Conway. Hilda Fay's reading is brilliant."
we love her
"Excellent!

If this an indication of how good the fiction I read this year is going to be, 2017 will be so much better than last year; admittedly, that's setting the bar awfully low.

""The Trespasser"" is French's 6th entry in her ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series, and it may be the second best, after only the first offering. She brings back the two detectives from the fifth novel, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, but this time tells the story from Conway's perspective, rather than Moran's. It is a supposedly tidy little domestic case that blows up in ways . . . well, you cannot say ways they didn't expect or didn't hope, but it does blow up.

At the time they get the case, Conway and Moran are still black sheeps in the squad, Moran because of past indiscretions and current associations with Conway, Conway because she is a woman, and carries a chip on her shoulder the size of a redwood tree. When they catch the case, they immediately try to blow it up into something bigger than it seems on first blush; though when it does finally, really get as big as they hoped--though not quite in the way they expected--and they are forced to deal with the real-world consequences, then it doesn't seem quite as exhilarating.

Anything more would spoil they mystery--and it is a mystery, though of course the limited cast means there are only a few suspects, and the twists and turns are the continual shifting of attention to one or the others. I thought that French did a good job of ratcheting up the tension, in part by having several storylines all converging in the mystery--it wasn't just a whodunit, but also was wrapped up in all the various inter-office politics as well as echoing issues in Conway's own life.

But of course one doesn't read French just for the mystery; she made that clear herself with the gutsy end of her first book. I've also enjoyed the gorgeous Irish dialogue and her descriptions of the Irish landscape after the devastations of neo-Liberal reforms and her commentary on the various class and sectional differences. She's flirted with the paranormal before, especially in the last book, but also with the riff on Gef the Talking Mongoose as well as those dark woods of the first book. This one, though, is hard-boiled, with no sense of the weird--but a bit of existentialism. Dig that title, The Trespasser: echoes of The Stranger and No Exit, I think.

One could see here some of French's influences. (Donna Tartt's inspiration was clear in a couple of other books.) There is a hint of Gillian Flynn--it might seem lazy, comparing two well-known women writers of mysteries, but the influence is there: the head-faked beginning, Conway's ""Cool Girl"" as one part of her personality, the focus on the stories were tell ourselves and how they can be manipulated if we are not careful or if we are in the presence of an excellent actor.

More surprisingly, there were echoes of James Ellroy. Not in the prose, certainly--though French's prose has gotten more acute, which accounts for some of this book's excellence. Early entries in the series sometimes had languorous sentences that made meaning a bit muddy; here, the sentences are not simple, but refined, and the point clear, if also allusive. Rather, the connection to Ellroy is there in French's burning through plots--the first half of the book, I kept wondering where she could go with the story, as fast as she was throwing out possibilities, then dismissing them. There's always been an echo of Ellroy's rapid changes in the way that French captures every shade of mood in her characters, the constant shifting of an active mind. Here, though, it's clearer.

Perhaps, too, the focus on police corruption brings Ellroy to mind. It's not a spoiler to say that Moran and Conway quickly suss out that rogue cops might be involved in the murder--that come sin less than the first hundred pages. Which is a small criticism I have. If there's one thing I've learned from reading crime novels and watching detectives on TV, it is that they are very reluctant to accuse their own. Conway and Moran seem more than happy to do so. To be fair, there's a point to this at the end, and the two are ostracized, but it still seems excessively rapid.

And that's in a book which is close to five hundred pages in hardback. But the book never feels overly long. The tension increases steadily to the mid-point, breaks, and ratchets back up again--and by the end, everything looks different, the story of the mystery, the characters, and the squad itself. It's really a nice piece of writing.

And it is so much more than just another issue in an on-going series. French had bigger ambitions, and she is succeeding at reaching them.

"
Another stellar book by French!
"Electrifying installment and definitely my new favorite in French's Dublin Murder Squad series. I felt the protagonist — a fierce warrior woman who is self-aware enough to know she can be her own worst enemy — equaled the ferocity of French's writing. Everyone has a story to tell, starting the one they tell themselves to make sense of the world around them. Det. Antoinette Conway wants to ""shoot every story,"" put holes in these ""fairytales"" although she knows the story she tells herself may not be the real truth of the world, especially in her job's male-dominated squad room. She has gone from alert to paranoid 24/7, dealing with not just her job's stressors as a homicide cop but also the constant ribbing, hazing, and societal judgements we all live with in and outside our own heads. Her investigation into a young pretty girl's death sets of a drastic sea change to Conway's self-story and her mindset about others. Her quest to catch this killer sets her against the establishment she works within, a place which seeks to bind, muffle and control her story. I enjoyed the audio book since it's easier for me to understand the thick brogue when read to and greatly liked the vocal performance. I've seen some reviews dislike the woman's voice and its cussing - interesting, because French's other ""male voiced"" books are filled with filthy language which fits her gritty world. There's less supernatural spookiness this go-round, which I missed, but gave a more grounded feel to this outing. No ambiguity about who did what to whom, unlike her much maligned debut mystery [INTO THE WOODS] and I prefer the tough honesty in Conway's honed sharp edges to French's previous 1 female det. Cassie Maddox who guttered out like a candle when undercover in THE LIKENESS. Unlike Maddox, the character of Det. Conway could carry an entire series upon her strong shoulders. Wonder which homicide detective spearheads the next series installment? Time will tell. Maybe another warrior woman will storm this Dublin castle?"
I'm going to be sorely disappointed when I finish all of Tana French's novels.
"I really love this series and think the structure is quite neat. A minor character in the first book becomes a viewpoint character in the second, and a support character in the second becomes the main viewpoint character in the third, and so on. In the fifth book, Stephen Moran is the viewpoint character who wants to get into the Murder Squad and does so through helping Antoinette Conway with a case.

The sixth book is from Conway's viewpoint, and she's having a rough time in the Murder Squad. She has started off on the wrong foot by breaking the finger of a fellow detective who sexually harassed her, and now people are playing pranks on her, including ""losing"" some of her important paperwork for her. She feels alienated from her workmates, knows she's on the edge of burnout and is considering leaving the squad when an unpromising domestic violence case gets handed to her and Moran. The case ends up being much more complicated than they ever expected, and Conway's own past comes back to haunt her during the investigation.

I don't want to give an spoilers, but I consider this one of the best in the series. I think the first, ""In the Woods,"" was the best, and this one and ""Broken Harbour"" probably tie for my #2 spot in the series. I have no idea where she's going to take it from here, though, because none of the minor characters seemed ripe for making them a main character in #7, if she does plan to write another of these. It's not necessary to read these in order, but I do recommend it, as they build on each other. Knowing what Conway and Moran went through in Book #5 definitely informs the way you'd read #6, for instance. I ADORE this series, even if I feel some entries were weaker than others. And, speaking of adaptations, it looks like the first two books are being adapted into a BBC TV series."
Probably the most involved of her novels. French always does a great job of really getting you into the characters. This comes in second to my favorite of hers Secret Place.
Kick ass detective story! 
"I loved this story. The characters were compelling -- Antoinette's voice, both internal and external, made her a very relatable and interesting character. The way Tana French writes her characters, I always feel like I get to know them well. This was a bit different from the previous books, I felt, like there were fewer suspects and auxiliary characters. The occasional tension between Conway and Moran was palpable, as was the constant tension (hostility?) between the two of them and Breslin. I really wasn't sure how the whole thing would turn out, which is the point of a well-written mystery. I very much enjoyed it."
"Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Detective Stephen Moran are back in Tana French's 6th Dublin Murder Squad Mystery, The Trespasser. She's still being hassled by some of the members of her squad with vicious pranks. She's been handed a stream of thankless cases since she and Stephen work the night shift. The new one involves the murder of a young woman found dead on her hearth, with the table set for two, wine glasses--the perfect setting for a romantic rendezvous. Looks like another ""lover"" did it. Except, Antoinette is sure she's seen the victim before. And that keeps nagging at her. At 449 pages you wouldn't think it could be a page turner but it is. Twists, turns, good leads, false leads, great writing. If you haven't read Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad books start with the first one, Into the Woods. Each novel, until the last two, are narrated by different members of the squad but worth reading in order."
Crikey. This was fabulous. I only wish there were more and more and more stories from the Dublin Murder Squad in the world. I love the way Tana French puts you so much in the heads of her characters that you can totally buy into the whole crazy ride. This was one of her best. 
One of my favorites in the murder series . . . and so much better than the 5th one. Can't wait for number 7!!
"Excellent who-dun-it drama! This was the 2nd book featuring Conway and Moran, and it was a 1000 times better than book #5. Great character development. "
I love all of this author's books! I like the loose connecting stories and learning more about the various characters in each book! Always a good read....
"Very good but the climax is a little disappointing and ""underwhelming"" in relation the rest of the novel."
" A - Fab as usual, but such an unlikeable female detective with a chip on her shoulder. They are both fairly new to the murder squad, but get a case passed on by their boss. A girl was found dead in her home. They're assigned an older det to mentor them, but he throws them red herrings of he's mixed up with criminals, on the take.....to keep suspicion away from his partner who had fallen for the girl. She'd roped him into it bc years earlier he'd known the whereabouts of her father and decided it was in her and her mother's best interests to not know he'd run off with another woman. Payback. He accidentally killed her. Their gaffer took him off to be booked. Antoinette and Steve Moran."
"Another Tana French Beauty!

I've loved everything Tana French has written. This one was no different. Love the Dublin murder squad. I anxiously await whatever comes next."
"Good page turner, my first of the Dublin Detective novels but I look forward to reading the others!"
first book I've read in the series and liked the foul-mouthed Antoinette cop. Twists and turns in this plot keeps me turning pages. 
5 stars! Great crime fiction with simple plot and fantastic characters. See my review: https://arlenesbookclub.com/the-tresp...
Very well done. 
"I enjoyed every spine-tingling twist and jerk of this book. Antoinette Conway is not the kind of character I'd usually identify with - she's rough and has a chip on her shoulder and makes crappy decisions for no clear reason. However, French brings you inside the gymnastics going on in her mind to the point where you are sensing every possibility of the case the way she would, and reacting to it almost viscerally. I'm pretty sad that I'm running out of French novels..."
Absolutely love the Tana French books! 
I did enjoy the twists and turns to this murder mystery. 
Definitely the best of the series so far. Good read. 
"This series is simply brilliant. Another fantastic book in the series. I'm tempted to say this is the best one yet, but then I feel I would betray beloved detectives Rob Ryan, Cassie Maddox, Frank Mackey, and Scorcher Kennedy in previous books. All these novels are so full of grit, complexity, and emotions that hit you in the gut. My favorite murder series by far.

One nitpicky thing that I mentioned previously. There is too much of a jarring difference in the narration of Conway and Moran from The Secret Place. This book's narrator did well with Conway's voice, but I ended up not thinking Moran's voice rang true. It certainly didn't in The Secret Place, so I just kept thinking of the Moran from Faithful Place, which was perfectly read. This is a slight quibble, though. This book was just fantastic."
"I'm never disappointed with Tana
French mystery,... and that is true of The Trespasser.
"
"Oh, Tana, you never let me down. "
"Disclaimer: I picked this one up without having read the first five books in the series - but having finished it, I can definitely say I have every intention of working through the rest.

Antoinette Conway, our leading personality, is an abrasive up-and-coming detective, singularly fixated on proving that she, as a biracial female, belongs to the squad as much as the next, despite the fact that she feels no particular camaraderie for her co-workers - apart from her partner, Stephen Moran. Steve is the perfect foil for Antoinette, in that he's everything she isn't (in terms of personality and, well, for lack of better terms, basic genetics. Through him, Conway catches a glimpse of what the detective life would've been like for her if she hadn't been of mixed descent, hadn't been female. Although he isn't necessarily best buds with the rest of the squad, he fits right in. The playground bullying is entirely directed at her
 - the first instance of which we see when the last page of her debriefing goes ""missing."" Conway instantly knows what's up, but it's not in her character to go running to O'Kelly (or even to admit to Steve that she's on the receiving end of another ill-intentioned prank) - she's fought tooth and nail to get this far and she's not about to piggyback on someone else to get where she wants to be.

I would call The Trespasser a character-driven story framed within a murder mystery. At the inception of the story, we know Antoinette is bitter about being the resident garbage collector of the squad, responsible for all the cases that her coworkers couldn't be bothered with. She's bitter about the way the ""alpha dogs"" of murder step all over her, especially when things that start out as pranks (nasty ones, but pranks nonetheless) begin to compromise her cases. At the same time, though, she knows she can count on Steve to back her up when necessary, she knows she can rely on him to reign her in every time she flies into bat-from-hell mode, especially when dealing with their superiors. In short, in an environment where trust and honesty are everything, the only person she can expect those things from are Steve. But out of nowhere, these very things she she's started to take for granted get flipped on their head, and suddenly it's like the rug's been pulled out from beneath her feet and she starts to question the status quo. Does she trust Steve because he's worthy of her trust, or just because he's presented the front of the ideal partner?Are her doubts founded in paranoia or something else? And if it is paranoia, then what's to say her good judgment is something she can count on anymore? And if it isn't, then all the years she's spent slogging away to make the big leagues has been for nothing, because what's the point of being a player on a team where everyone wants you to walk the gangway (or should I say Conway) plank?

And while Antoinette is having this mental breakdown, her case is out for a tailspin: Steve is convinced of one thing (something her gut agrees with, but if Steve is backing it, then what are the chances he's just trying to make a fool of her?), her superior is shoving another theory down her throat, and her boss has her on a tight schedule. But Antoinette doesn't want to close the case, she wants to get it right. She's out to bring justice, but with all these conflicting agendas, it's clear that not everyone else is.

I'd recommend The Trespasser to anyone who's looking for a strong female protagonist, a page turner, and a solid storyline with a twist (which I am sorry to say I did not see until the reveal). The way French toyed with the idea of Antoinette as an unreliable narrator was so elegantly done that I found myself reading into her interactions with the supporting cast of characters, looking for things that were - or weren't - there.

Detective Moran, of course, does not hesitate to offer to Antoinette - and you - a psychoanalysis of his partner: ""You’re so set on going down in flames, you’d make it happen even if the entire force loved you to bits. You’ll light your own bloody self on fire if you have to. And then you can pat yourself on the back and tell yourself you knew it all along.""
"
"I listened to this book and absolutely loved the whole 18 cds. Complex protagonist, great story. Highly recommend it."
"In this sixth (and hopefully not last) edition of Tana French's brilliant Dublin Murder Squad series, ""The Trespasser,"" the author appears less interested in mapping out the ghosts of Ireland's rich natural history or exploring the nature of today's Irish culture and society as she has previously, than she is in ruminating on the nature of stories themselves - stories we tell ourselves, stories we tell others, stories that buck us up during hard times, and stories that distract us from the challenges of the day. Even true stories are embellished based on the needs of the teller, the interests of listener/reader. Sometimes storytellers leave out important information because the facts may impinge on our enjoyment or understanding of the tale.

In ""The Trespasser"" a beautiful twenty-something woman named Aislinn Murray is found dead in her apartment, having been violently punched in the face and having hit the back of her head on the fireplace hearth. Her clothes, hair and makeup are magazine perfect, and her apartment looks as though it has been decorated from a designer catalogue. The table is set for a romantic dinner for two, with the dinner having been cooked (and overcooked due to her death). No apparent DNA, fingerprints, or fibers to help with the investigation. The entire place has been wiped down.

The key scenes in this novel are different from her first five Dublin Murder Squad. Here the action mostly occurs within Interviews, mostly in the Garda interrogation rooms, as her two Detectives Conway and Moran (the leads again, following book five, although this novel has Antoinette Conway's first person narration rather than the more junior Stephen Moran's from that novel) ask questions, posit theories and verbally joust with a variety of witnesses and suspects. As French puts it, ""Another story. None of the rest were true straight through, not one. Victims, witnesses, killers, Ds, all frantically spinning stories to keep the world the way they want it, dragging them over our heads, stuffing them down our throats; and now our gaffer.""

Meanwhile, French's prose remains top-notch, funny and insightful, and with a hint of old-timey noir. Here are a couple examples:

""In the car pool, I pick out the keys to a scraped-up white Opel Kadett. Stoneybatter is old Dublin, working class and never-worked class, mixed with handfuls of yuppies and artists who bought there during the boom because it was so wonderfully authentic, meaning because they couldn’t afford anywhere fancier. Sometimes you want a car that’s going to turn heads. Not this time.""

""Crowley is a little snot-drip who works for a red-top rag called the Courier, which specializes in printing just a few too many details about rape cases, for readers who want more buzz of outrage or whatever else than they can get off the normal papers. His look is Poet Meets Pervert—floppy shirts and a dandruffy mac, wavy dark ponytail groomed over a big oily bald spot—and his face is permanently set on Righteous Offense. I’d rather brush my teeth with a chainsaw than tip off Crowley.""

These and the rest of the novel are a joy to read. By the end, as the detectives look back on the case, the importance of telling stories is reiterated: ""The wonder in his voice. He sounds like a teenager, lifting with joy and amazement, he sounds so tender you could bruise him with one wrong touch. Time after time it’s left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.""

If this is the final chapter of the Dublin Murder Squad series, this is a brilliantly apt way to conclude. Highly recommended."
Another amazing book from Tana French! Not my favorite in the Dublin Murder Squad series but still 5 stars. I'm already hoping and keeping an eye out for the next one!!! 
"All nighter!

What can I say that will give you nothing but the will to read? My dad, a homicide cop, would have come in late off a case, too keyed up to sleep. He would have picked this book off my desk and read all night- finishing it and dozing off in the beginning gray of the morning. Now you go read it!"
"Loved this book. Even though it was #6 in a series, I read it without reading the first 5 and found it to excellent as a standalone read. However, I will go back now and start from the beginning because the book was outstanding. Excellent elements of a police procedural, but also a lot of depth to the characters the evolved significantly throughout the book. I really loved the interview segments where you got inside Antoinette's head to understand how she perceived the interviewee and their responses and related to her fellow detectives during the interview. "
One of my favorite Tana French novels yet. Great character development.
lead character Antoinette is so credible and authentic she practically walks out of the pages
My new favorite author!
A favorite book by one of my favorite authors. A definite page-turner that is equally witty and creepy. Beautifully constructed-plot with a surprise ending that even a well-seasoned mystery reader didn’t see coming!
Tana French does not disappoint in this sixth novel. I love it when I find a story I cannot put down. This was one of them. 
The perfect book for a day when you just want to veg out. Great characters and suspense.
"What I've loved about many of Tana French's books, and was so clear to me in The Trespasser, is that they stay good right up to and including the very end. The last 2% of the book was just as important and fascinating as the first 98%. While this isn't the shortest book, it did not drag or meander. The details in this book were important. While the Dublin Murder Squad books might be primarily lumped in with mysteries, they aren't just for readers of that genre. Readers of literary fiction and really, just good books, should be reading Tana French's books. I love the loose connection between the books instead of a series that is dependent on the previous book. Each of the primary, narrating characters in these books has been different than the ones that came before with different lenses that they are viewing their work from. As always I will be anxiously awaiting the next!

"Great story

Plenty of twists and turns to make it challenging but such good characterization give this book a realistic and clear eyed look at the life of murder detectives."
Rich. I loved it! Didn't want it to end. 
6th book of a series...Always entertaining and interesting. New case for Detectives of the Irish Murder Squad. Young girl found murder in her flat. Detectives Conway and Moran will find this case to have an everlasting effect on the Murder Squad. 
I found Tana French and just finished the last of her “Murder Squad” books. I’ve loved them all.
"Just before dawn on a frigid Dublin night, a young woman is found dead in her sleek apartment, with dinner in the oven, wine on the table and a fatal head injury. In Tana French’s new ‘Dublin Murder Squad’ novel, The Trespasser, Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are just finishing the night shift when they are called to investigate the murder. All the signs point to a lovers’ tiff and it should be an easy win for Conway and Moran but nothing is ever quite as straightforward as it seems in the Dublin Murder Squad.

If you aren’t familiar with French’s series, each book features a different detective from the squad in the central role and the protagonist is usually a minor character from the previous book. (If you haven't read any of the others in the series, you don't have to read them in order, although I find it more enjoyable to read them that way.) In the case of The Trespasser, the sixth in the series, we see the same two detectives as in the previous novel, The Secret Place, but with Conway assuming the role of narrator while Moran fades into the background.

Conway is the only woman on the squad and tries to make up for the prejudices against her by acting twice as tough. She will never be ‘one of the lads’ and she has few friends and allies on the squad, Moran — a relative newbie — being one of them. Beneath her abrasive exterior, however, lies a passionate woman. Joining the murder squad has long been a dream of hers and she describes it almost as though it were a lover: “When it’s working right, it would take your breath away: it’s precision-cut and savage, lithe and momentous, it’s a big cat leaping full-stretch or a beauty of a rifle so smooth it practically fires itself.”

But as the events of The Trespasser opens, Conway is more concerned with avoiding firing herself — or, at least, being pushed out of her job by the old boys’ network. This new murder may even be the last murder enquiry she gets to run and she is more determined than ever to prove her ability. Yet it soon becomes clear that not everyone on the squad is happy with the way she is handling the case but is that because someone doesn’t like her personally or because they are afraid of what she might find out?

Tightly focused around just a few wintry Dublin days, The Trespasser is precise and meticulous. The case unfolds almost in real time and we get full, detailed interviews with witnesses and suspects from Conway’s perspective without summaries or exposition; no shortcuts are taken with the narrative. In the wrong hands, this could feel plodding, frustrating and poorly plotted but French is a master of suspense and I found myself wanting even more detail. For once, I had the mystery sussed early on in the novel, but French kept me second-guessing myself until the final act.

One of the aspects of the Dublin Murder Squad series that I have always enjoyed the most is the seamless weaving in of the lead detective’s back story. In this case, aspects of Conway’s past do come back to haunt her, but the links with the present case are more thematic here than usual. More interesting is Conway’s present-day power struggle with her fellow murder squad detectives; at times, I was more interested in finding out the outcome of that than of the murder itself. As usual, though, French does a good job of putting the reader inside the head of a character that she already knows and doesn’t necessarily like and make her, if not necessarily likeable, then at least somewhat more sympathetic.

The Trespasser is almost 500 pages long and although it isn’t a conventional page-turner (on the contrary; it’s dense and slow-moving), I found myself racing through to the end. My only frustration with finishing the novel is that I will now have to wait another two years for French’s next novel.

**Disclaimer: I received a pre-release copy via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.**>"
I am hooked on Tana French's books!
"Fantastic. This is one of those books that you make the mistake of starting right before you need to begin doing things like feeding the people in your house and so you spend the entire meal and time after silently begging everyone to just eat, stop asking random questions (Will I do my open water dive in Lake Okoboji? Why do zombies really die only if you destroy their brains? Do you want to sing the Peppa Pig theme song?), go to bed already and leave me in peace!! Which is why I stayed up until well past my bedtime on said night to finish this book which left me zombie-like myself the next day, but it was worth it.
The crime was interesting and the solution twisty, but more than that I appreciated the focus on the stories we tell ourselves and the lives we live in our heads, and the consequences of both. Very much recommended."
"This was my first experience with an audiobook, and The Trespasser made my long drives for work feel much shorter and easier. I found myself anxious to get on the road so I could hear the next section of the book! Although one chapter was a little exhausting trying to tie up all the loose ends and explain the ending, this was an engaging, interesting book with full, rich characters."
"You know, I actually guessed the outline of the solution in this one pretty early on, and it didn't ruin the book one iota. It's just fantastically written with wonderfully drawn characters, with layer upon layer. Really good."
This is the first book from Tana French that I’ve read but it definitely won’t be my last. I could not put this down. This kept you on your toes the entire time wanting more. So good and highly recommend! 
"Some people may shy away from crime stories for fear of​ descriptions​ being too graphic or violent​, and to them, I'd recommend Tana French's police novel ""The Trespasser""​. While there i​s a victim of a blunt force trauma in the book, the ​details of the death are barely more detailed than that what I just described.

The book reminded me in one way to the 2016 movie ""Spotlight"". When released, I had no interest in seeing ​that movie​, since it dealt with the story of predator priest​s​ abusing young boys. It's an uncomfortable subject, and the idea of seeing a movie ​on that topic had no appeal to me. Even when it won Academy Awards for best movie and best screenplay, it didn't change my mind. But eventually, enough people described the movie ​to me ​as being mainly about the process​ of the investigation by Boston Globe reporters​, and how they were able to​ first ​ break the ​news. And the physical abuse of the boys, while always lurking in the background, was never the prime focus of the movie.

And that's how I felt about ​Tana French's ""The Trespasser"". While there is a crime, an apparent murder, the book is really much more about the police investigation itself. The setting is in Ireland, and an anonymous caller reported that a woman is in her home and has a head injury and needs an ambulance. When police arrive, the woman is found dead​, the conditions are suspicious, and the case is assigned to the murder squad. The chief assigns the case to the only female detective in the squad and her relatively inexperienced partner. As the only woman in a male dominated squad, Detective Conway isn't fully accepted by her peers. Occasional harassment, sophomoric pranks and a lack of respect make her job more difficult than necessary, but she doesn't let those problems affect her performance. ​There is some pressure on Detective Conway to bring the case to a quick resolution, however the evidence against the prime suspect, the new boyfriend, is circumstantial at best. Several of the more senior detectives deride the speed at which the investigation proceeds, but Detective​ Conway​ holds her ground and pursues all possibilities. Eventually, her hard work pays off, and an alternate suspect is identified.

​I liked the lead Detective, since despite being occasionally harassed, intimidated, obstructed, and isolated, she ignores these obstacles and is able to do her job. Like other people breaking new ground, e.g., the first black baseball player, the first female firefighter, the first openly gay soldier, etc., ​Detective Conway shows she's got the stuff to do her job, and can endure the petty harassment to prove she's up to the task. I liked her strength and smarts, and her dedication to doing her best under difficult circumstances.

The author does a good job of making the ​detective ​squad, the ​crime ​suspects, ​the ​potential ​witnesses, and the police superiors all seem like a mix of ​fairly normal people. ​None, including Detective Conway, are perfect, yet none are so purely ​evil that they see​m unrealistic. ​And ​I liked the fact that ​it didn't take an unrealistic super-hero investigator to solve the crime​. It just​ took hard work, dedication and perseverance. ​The result is a story ​which seemed ​plausible​, and told in a way which maintained ​my interest without needing those exotic out-of-nowhere end of story miracles to ​solve the case.​ And the audiobook format added to the experience. Since the book takes place in Ireland, the reader kept my mind on location with the appropriate Irish accent during the narration.

While this book is the sixth in a series, it's the first I'd read by the author. I liked it enough to go back and pick up one or more of the earlier books in the series, hopeful that I'll find them as enjoyable as this one."
My favorite yet!
"Tana French forever! This novel, like all the Dublin Murder Squad novels, is a great reminder that the best crime writing privileges complicated characters over complicated plots."
"I am not wild about Antoinette's potty mouth, but this mystery was great! Might be my favorite Dublin Murder Squad mystery."
"After reading reviews of this latest Tana French murder mystery, I was afraid it would not be as enjoyable a read as her previous novels. I actually found this to be the best, most well written of the lot, with a story that was more plausible than The Likeness, and characters that were more finely drawn. Murder Squad Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran are still finding their way as new partners on the Murder Squad. A young woman turns up dead in her home and the evidence points to her new boyfriend. The victim and Det. Conway were both abandoned by their fathers at a young age, and this theme resonates throughout the story; ultimately providing crucial evidence and motive. Chapter 13 is just about the best prose I have read from this author, and the later scenes in the interview room had me on the edge of my seat. A great read."
Couldn't read the last 20% fast enough; it was unputdownable. Pure murder mystery fun.
"Audio
Too bad I started at the most recent book in the series. There wad a lot of back story that I didn't follow. I will be going back to the beginning.
Awesome female lead. Twisty case in the end."
"I really enjoyed the layers of confusion in reading this - is the narrator unreliable or not? I liked that a lot in this book, not as much in the earlier books. "
"Mystery, suspense and police thriller readers, rejoice! This book is a rare delight - you will absolutely love every scrumptious word of the 464 pages. Stephen King called it “incandescent,” and we all know Stephen chooses his words carefully.

A beautiful young woman is found dead in her small cottage home in the Dublin neighborhood of Stoneybatter, apparently murdered in the midst of preparation for a romantic dinner for two. Antoinette Conway and her new partner Steve Moran, detectives on the Murder Squad, are assigned to the case. Suspicion immediately falls on her new boyfriend, Rory Fallon, who came early for the 8 o’clock dinner date and was unable to get Aislinn (Ash-lynn) Murray to come to the door or to answer his text messages. After about 30 minutes of trying everything while shivering in the cold, he chalked it up to another rejection and headed for home.

When Moran and Conway arrive at the scene, Conway is convinced she knows the victim from somewhere, but cannot remember where. This inkling proves to be important in solving the case, as she later remembers Aislinn from Missing Persons, Conway’s post before she made it to Murder Squad. This realization is the beginning of the intricate plot that Ms. French has gifted us with in this lovely book. The characters are as complex as the plot and it a joy to see the story unfold in your mind as you read.

It is written in first person with Conway as the narrator. In the early part of the book she seems rather paranoid, never leaving her coffee cup on her desk when she leaves the room, putting her coat on the back of her chair, not hanging it on the coat rack. She is aware of conversations that abruptly end when she enters the area. But since she is the only female in the Murder Squad and has found her locker contents urinated on, her desk drawer jimmied, we come to understand there is a basis for the paranoia.

The relationship between Moran and Conway seems okay, but we know Conway doesn’t really trust any of the people in her squad, although Moran is there because she recommended him. So, there is a certain level of mutual respect. One of the most pleasing aspects of the book was watching their relationship grow.

As far as the storyline is concerned, to say it is complex is a profound understatement. The web of interconnections that Ms. French brings to life in this book is astounding. She is quite simply a genius storyteller. If you liked the surprises in Gone Girl, you will adore The Trespasser. Conway is a strong, independent, no-nonsense person but her paranoia about work relationships, and her family situation with her mother make her vulnerable/relatable to the reader. The story covers a time period of a week and boy, what a week it turns out to be. Not until the very final 10 pages of so of the book do we find out for sure who did it, how and why.

The Trespasser is #6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series but it is not necessary to have read any of the previous books to enjoy this. The books have overlapping characters but each features different detectives in the squad. When I enjoy a book this much, I always think it should be made into a movie or TV miniseries. Apparently, Paramount had an option on one of the books, but they didn’t make the movie and the option expired. Some UK TV producers picked it up as well as the TV rights to the first three books (In The Woods, The Likeness, Faithful Place). Not sure when it will air here in the States.

A great detective mystery read from the green isle
The best audiobooks! This magically clever dialogue came to life with these fabulous actors
"Not sure why I started with book #6? I am in love with the characters, the storyline, everything about this novel!
I already bought #1,2,3 & 4! Need to start from the beginning with this series. :)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Stars"
"I was on Carnival cruise lines, heading towards Aruba, when I found a place that would be my favorite spot on the boat. The Library Bar. That's where I found this book. I read a few pages, decided I wasn't into it, and moved on to something else. Later, I found a cheap copy at McKay's in Nashville and decided to give it another shot, picking up where I left off. Boy, oh boy, am I glad I did. French wrote the book on writing dialogue. It's the interrogations that make the book so hard to put down. I read for an hour every night before going to sleep, and have a certain time I stop no matter what. And let me tell you, with this book it was . . . painful. There's so many other things to like about this book than just its addictiveness, though. French doesn't see the detectives through rose colored glasses, as some crime novelists do. She's almost as good as Gillian Flynn at creating characters you love to hate. (Better than Flynn at dialogue? Maybe?) The first person's inner thoughts make you think ""Why would someone be such an 'arsehole?'"" I immediately went out looking for more French books. I got ""The Witch Elm,"" then decided I wanted another one from Dublin Murder Squad instead. There's six of them! Holy ""shite!"""
Spoilers***What a great end to the murder squad series. From the start I was curious if one of the Detectives would be a big part of it and damn it was crazy when everything was unraveled. Love Tana French’s writing.
"Tana French hits another home run. Antoinette Conway might be the most complex and unlikeable Murder D we've followed around yet, but I loved being inside her paranoid, cranky mind. So much, that when I arrived home from work last night at 6:30, I was only about 80 pages in, and then proceeded to stay up later than expected so I could finish the subsequent 370 pages in one sitting.

I can only think of one flaw, which is that 
her suspicions about Steve came too late, and lasted for too short a time. It seemed like if she was going to have that snap, there should have been more seeds beyond a slight exasperation with her perceptions of his people-pleasing earlier, even if they didn't play out as angrily as her total loss of trust. But this is a minor flaw, and if I could avoid comparing this to the incomparable In the Woods, I might even give this a 5-star rating (once again, I decry 5-star rating systems! Give me 10!).

Edit 11/24/19: I am upping this to five stars given that I've now read it 3 times and it hasn't got old - in fact twice in a year seems to merit a 5-star rating on its own. (edit 1/22/23 i have red it a fourth time. it holds up.)
As such, it doesn't have the moss-green haze or the golden-red sun-dappled shine of In the Woods or The Likeness, but it has its own ice-blue tautness which outshines even The Secret Place (which I enjoyed thoroughly). I maintain that no one can do dialogue or banter quite like Tana French; it is never unclear unless she intentionally wants you to get lost in the back-and-forth; it is fast and propulsive. I have no particular love of dialogue in books - so often it feels forced, or the voices don't distinguish themselves from the narration for me to follow clearly - and often narration, imagery, etc., do more of the heavy lifting for me, which is why I find it so wonderful that she knows what she's doing when she opens a character's mouth.

(I read a review at one time of Quentin Tarantino's use of dialogue not as exposition or filler but as crucial parts of the drama itself; he mines dialogue scenes for as much tension and plot development as any other part of a film. (I don't actually like Tarantino that much, but this is pretty objectively true.) That's how Tana French does it. Two or three people in a room talking - as much of the finale of the book is* - is as masterful and riveting as twisty plots or traumatic memories or any of the other things that make thrillers thrillers.)

I'll also add that usually I spot books in first person and have to think hard about whether or not I will read them, but Tana French has earned my trust in that respect as well. Her detectives are always singular and unique, and often disturbingly compelling to live with for 500 pages.

Anyway: a great read, I'm glad I stayed up to finish it but I'm sad it's over, because now I have to wait for the next one. wtf.

*My fourth read was as a library ebook so i bookmarked where the big dialogue climax began and ended. 
McCann’s interview lasted 40 pages (of 679) then Breslin’s went for the next 20, then O’Kelly talking to McCann lasts ANOTHER 15 after a few pages of other conversation. The last entire 10% of the book is just interrogation and dialogue!"
"Once I got into it I was hooked. The story is intricately crafted, the characters deftly drawn, and lots of dialogue keeps it moving. The writing jumps off the page - terrific. Set in Dublin, couldn't understand some of the vocabulary but it didn't faze me. It's more than a good mystery it's a great read!"
"I love these books by Tana French. They're so well written, with such interesting characters. In fact I think I may reread the entire series. "
"I've read all of Tana French's Murder Squad books and each one is different in its own way. This one was no exception. I had a hard time liking Antoinette Conway, but she and Steve Moran make a great team figuring out who killed Aislinn Murray. It was an amazing thriller. "
"I've read every single one of Tana French's books and, while they are not always perfect, I am never disappointed. The Trespasser is no exception to this; in fact, in my educated opinion, it may be French's best novel yet.

The thing that excited me most about reading this book wasn't the synopsis of the storyline itself, which actually sounded rather trite, but the promise of a female narrator in the form of Detective Antoinette Conway, first introduced by French in The Secret Place. In many ways, Conway lived up to my expectations: she was smart, tough, and made of steel, ready for danger and refusing to cower in the face of sexism, discrimination, or, you know, murderers. Her witty banter and obvious rapport with her partner (and narrator of The Secret Place), Stephen Moran, was fun to read, and their friendship and partnership made the entire book more compelling. That said, Conway was an imperfect narrator. She was short-tempered, to the point where she frustrated even me, let alone her fellow characters, and more than a little bit paranoid (not that she didn't have a decent reason to be). Her stubborn refusal to trust anyone and her constant assumption that others were out to get her was a major character flaw that, frankly, became rather annoying at a certain point. In the end, it's probably what kept her from being my all-time favorite French narrator, although she's definitely high on the list.

In the end, despite my expectations, what really sold The Trespasser to me wasn't the characters (though they were solid as always), but the plot. It was fast-moving, intriguing without being overly complicated, with enough layers to it to be truly compelling. The way that French allowed the story to unfold let the reader get to know the victim, Aislinn Murray, in a way that was somewhat unique for a French novel, where the focus is usually much more on developing the characters of the living than of the dead. All told, French was able to weave together a story that, while perhaps not the most unpredictable, was somehow both beautifully intricate and stunningly straightforward.

I would be the first person to admit that, when it comes to French, my biggest quibble is usually the ending. More than once, I have been left unsatisfied, if not downright angry, by the way French wrapped things up (or didn't, in at least one case). While I can't go into detail for fear of spoilers, I will say this: The Trespasser has, by far and without doubt, the best ending of any of French's novels so far. It seamlessly wraps up a story that might otherwise be merely average and elevates it into something much more, tying together Conway's personality and character journey with that of Aislinn Murray and the case itself in the absolute perfect way. It also gives the spotlight to a character who I have long suspected was something much deeper than consistently portrayed, leaving me wondering just where French will take us next, and just who she will have take us there. Suffice it to say, after a read as good as this one, I can't wait to find out.

Rating: 5 Stars"
Another perfect mystery from one of my favorite authors. 
Tightly plotted and character-driven with all of the procedural awesomeness I've come to expect from Tana French. 
"Thoroughly enjoyable. I read the first book in the series and have been wanting Rob and Cassie to get back together either as partners or lovers or both. What Tana French does in The Trespasser is thoroughly rewarding as she works back through the central relationship that drives the entire series and brings it to a different but more satisfying place. It’s not the place I wanted to be, (but I am not the author!) it is the place that French wants to show us."
"Another engrossing installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series (#6)! As often happens (especially on the heels of a really great read), it took me a little while to fully appreciate this audiobook listen as I bristled at Antoinette Conway's tough demeanor. Yet I thoroughly trusted the author's skill—she has never let me down. I was not disappointed and quickly became completely engrossed in this mystery so full of masterful twists and turns as the story of Aislinn's death unfolds. As other reviewers have pointed out, French features her characters and their development as much, or more so, than the mystery plot itself which is one reason I am so drawn to her books. Well read by Hilda Fay. I really appreciated the ""Irish-isms"" and the pronunciation of names and places as I listened to this atmospheric tale. (Steve Moran = ""Mor'n""; Aislinn = ""Ashleen""; etc.) 5 stars for complete enjoyment."
This is my first intro into the series (I do hate reading out of order) but the audiobooks of this series are hard to come by. The narrator was fabulous with accents and voices and this wasn't a typical murder mystery. Tana French really gets you pulled into the case and people involved and throws up so many red herrings you don't know what surprise is in store. Very enjoyable listen!
"Another absolute corker from Tana French! The Trespasser reunites the duo of Conway and Moran, and they now just might be my favorite pair-up of the Squad (sorry, Cassie and Rob). Antoinette is a bit hard to like a the narrator sometimes--the woman is harsh--but French clearly sketches out what makes her this way, and you've got to admire her for being so unapologetically so. At the rate I go through these, I wish French could come out with one every month, but, as ever, this was well worth the wait. "
"Another great read from Tana French. Like her others, I couldn't put it down. "
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad books, this may be my new favorite, after the first one- that was so damn good."
"Tana French does it again - she is an amazing writer! This was one of my favorites - and the only one I didn’t love was The Secret Place. I have not read them all in order, but it wouldn’t have hurt. I enjoyed Antoinette in this book more than I did in The Secret Place. This one had plot & detectives/characters that were interesting, & I enjoyed all the mind games her characters play, as well as this book’s emphasis on the stories that we tell ourselves. Hope she has another one in the works!"
Tana French never fails great crime novel ! Hope I don't have to wait long for the next one !
Intricate. Good character development. 
"Ossessione. Manipolazione. Disincanto.
Queste sono le prime parole che mi vengono in mente, pensando a “L’intruso”, sesto romanzo di Tana French, pubblicato in Italia da Einaudi Stile Libero Big e considerato “incandescente” da Stephen King.
In una Dublino sempre intrigante per noi lettori si muove una storia opprimente; non per chi la legge, ma per i suoi protagonisti. Tutti, dal primo all’ultimo.Aislinn Murray è bionda, bella, affascinante. Aislinn Murray si veste sempre alla moda. Aislinn Murray ha un appartamento arredato come nelle riviste patinate. Aislinn Murray è morta. Proprio in quell’appartamento patinato, proprio con quei suoi vestiti da modella.
I detective Antoinette Conway e Steve Moran sono a capo di quella che sembra una normale indagine per un omicidio domestico. Beh, inutile dirvi che di normale, in questa indagine, ci sarà ben poco.

Un crime molto particolare, questo di Tana French. Scritto in prima persona, al presente. La voce di Antoinette ci racconta le indagini e le dinamiche all’interno di una squadra di detective ma, soprattutto, ci racconta i se. I se del caso e i se della vita: la sua, quella di Aislinn, quella dei suoi colleghi; la nostra. Ogni personaggio di questa storia ha i suoi se. Ma chi non ha qualche se, nella sua vita?
È lungo, questo romanzo. Ma anche le ossessioni sono lunghe, instancabili, sfiancanti. Forse, qualche pagina in meno poteva rendere questa lettura più scorrevole; d’altra parte, questa sua lunghezza, questo suo contorcersi sulle varie ipotesi fa sì che anche noi lettori ci sentiamo attanagliati da una miriade di dubbi. Storditi. E non vi nascondo che se verso la metà mi sentivo un po’ stanca, da lì in poi ho letto tutto d’un fiato. Perché alla fine è impossibile non lasciarsi travolgere da tutti questi se.
E poi, l’ironia che pervade le pagine riesce ad alleggerire quella sensazione di… stanza chiusa, di nessuna via d’uscita.
Davvero accattivante, poi, il modo in cui la French ci spiega le dinamiche degli interrogatori, del rapporto con i testimoni, con i presunti colpevoli, con i colleghi della squadra: qui non siamo in tivù, dice Antoinette. Ed è proprio vero: quella che viene fuori da questa storia non è la classica indagine da serie Tv.
I vari personaggi escono fuori dalle pagine, si fanno tridimensionali. Te li ritrovi accanto e fai il tifo per loro, e un attimo dopo, vorresti ucci… metterli in manette! L’autrice gioca con noi lettori come fa con i protagonisti della sua storia. Li/ci porta dove vuole.
Quell’ossessione di cui vi parlavo pervade ogni pagina di questo romanzo, ogni personaggio. A volte, se (!) ci soffermassimo a osservare a distanza le cose, invece di perderci nelle nostre elucubrazioni… potremmo capire tanto di più… goderci tanto di più.
“L’intruso” è disincanto, manipolazione e ossessione. Davvero un crime di ottimo livello.

"A BRILLIANTLY EXECUTED NOVEL
This is the first novel I have read in the six book Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. All books in the series have consistently received positive reviews but this particular novel has the reputation of being the best to date. Having finished the novel I can agree that the praise for this novel is well deserved.
The book is narrated in the first person by Detective Antoinette Conway', which makes for interesting reading. Conway made her first appearance in the earlier Dublin Murder Squad book: The Secret Place. The language isn't usually very pretty but honestly reflects Detective Conway's upbringing and her thoughts in forthright manner. And the book is all the richer for that.
In Dublin murders are apparently usually investigated by twin detective duos (plus designated ""floaters"") and Detectives Conway and Moran are allotted what at first appears a domestic Murder case. This is the usual type of murder type allocated to them and they are beginning to despair at not getting a crack at more complicated crime. However, not is all that it first appears, and the intrepid pair find themselves with an investigation which may have wider implications than anyone would have first thought.
Narration by Conway in the first person works ever so well as we are party to her innermost thoughts, emotions (or lack thereof) and doubts: current and past. As I mentioned above the language used includes liberal use of swearing but is appropriate given Conway's background and the manner of narration. The terminology used by the Dublin police force is educational and the characterisation of all main persona excellent.
The novel is very cleverly plotted and difficult to put down once started. Internal police politics are very much in evidence although the absence of political pressure is a relief. The tension builds as pressure mounts for an arrest but Conway resists, expressing doubts, on the basis that the police case against the prime suspect is based on circumstantial evidence and continues looking for more tangible evidence. Her doubts incur the ridicule of some older Murder Squad hands but eventually her patience pays off.
Based around an original plot, which has deeper implications than anyone would have thought at the start of the investigation, the novel was a delight to read and kept me guessing as to the outcome right to the end.
The novel was so good I intend to read the earlier books in the series. It definitely ranks as one of, if not the best, crime thrillers of 2016. The Trespasser is a story which is engrossing and thought provoking.
(My review was based on an eBook file provided to me by the publisher via NetGalley. My review is totally independent.)
"
"My problem with Tana French novels are two: I want to keep reading them until they're done, forsaking everything else and I don't want them ever to end. Each one is better than the last."
"Ok ....this is typically not the kind of book I would ever read...
But it had so many good reviews I decided to give it try.
Couldn't put it ...I obsessively read and read it!
My sympathetic nervous system felt like it was on high alert
Highly recommend it"
"Brilliant Tara French per usual

No one does atmospheric menace & corrosive self-doubt mingled with hubris as well as she does. Excellent, well-paced, twisty thriller/mystery."
Love the protagonist. 
"Prepare yourself for some biased gushing. I can't help myself, I really love this author. I've always made the comment that I'd have her babies. I would. She is a brilliant genius when it comes to literary mystery. What's just as brilliant is her work in audio form.

When it comes to my favorite genre, I am not an easy sell. There are thousands of decent books and series that throw damaged detectives, body parts, scenes of torture, and crazy street chases at us. I have loyalty to some...I mean, Jack Reacher, why not? But I always have to ask myself ""what sets this book apart from all the rest?"". There has to be something unique to keep me coming back, investing my time. And here is my answer about Tana's books: her characters. Funny thing, I rarely remember who the bad guys are in her stories, but I never forget her detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad. Each book in the series focuses on a new character who played a minor part in a previous novel. These personalities are so fully-realized, the chemistry so tangible, they take up residence in your head and heart forever. They each have their own hang-ups and struggles in addition to the case they are working. The cases are not some author-imposed contest with other novels to see who can drum up the nastiest bit of evil. They all ring true, but are complicated and twisty and veiled with lies and alternate agendas. This is full-immersion reading.

In this story, detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran (from The Secret Place) are investigating what appears to be a cut-and-dried domestic murder. Dinner date goes wrong, and a pretty young women is left to die after a fatal head injury. But strange pressure from other members of the squad make Conway suspicious, and things aren't sitting right with her. It doesn't help that it seems like every other member of the murder squad hates her except her partner. Her reports go missing, someone pees in her locker...standard male-dominance bullying. But she has an edge and she is like a dog with a bone, and she basically doesn't give a crap. The final few hours in the audio wrap up with the intensity I'm used to...interrogations and confessions that you normally see in Tana's novels, but are unrivaled. You speed to the ending, as I did tonight.

One more bit of raving. These audios. They just don't get any better than this. Yes, I love me some Irish accent, but the narrators are also first class. This is the second female narrator (the first was The Likeness) and was as spectacular as the male narrators (who are crush-worthy I might add). Trust me on this one...if you like audio please do not miss these.

"
"In French's latest Dublin crime/mystery novel, murder detective Antoinette Conway and her partner are assigned to investigate a murder that at first seems to be just another domestic violence incident. But when Conway suddenly remembers that she's seen this victim before.... somewhere... she starts to theorize that maybe there's something more at play.

This is another great novel by French; I kept reading it when I *should* have been reading my novel for my book group."
"Let the Trespasser Into Your Mind

This novel is a mix of great character development with a believable and intricate plot. The setting in Ireland gives windows of insight into the differences between European and American cultures and institutions. It was a very satisfying read."
"This book was amazing. I loved it. I have loved all her books, even if some of them were difficult and disturbing to read. But they are all brilliant and this one is maybe my favorite. I wasn't sure about it from time to time in the middle, mostly because so much of the action takes place inside the main character's head. But is has the most satisfying ending of all of her books, and I found an unlikable character to be very likeable by the end. "
I love a good detective mystery!
"4.5 Holy rollercoaster of detective-ness! More Character driven and wee Less thriller ..but So immaculately written!
Tana French is great writer

Now that I’ve finished series ratings

1. In the woods
2. The likeness
3. Broken harbor
4. Trespasser
5. Faithful place
6. Secret place"
"The Trespasser is the sixth installment of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series and if you are already a fan of her works you should be aware that her books have that literary edge alongside the police procedural and this is one reason why I love her books so much - they are well written, descriptive and offer much insights of the police works we rarely get to see from other crime thrillers. Yes, and that's what makes her books stand out from the others. Not only that, I also love the characterisations in all her books, even if they are secondary roles. And another good thing is, these secondary roles do become French's lead characters in her next book.

In her previous installment (The Secret Place), readers are introduced to Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. They are now partners in The Trespasser; and while they are in the Murder Squad, the cases they are assigned to are usually predictive and unchallenging, such as domestic cases. Now the new case they are assigned to seems like one of those but some instincts told them that this case is more than meets the eye.

The twenty-ish old victim, Aislinn Murray, suffered from a fatal head injury at her house. On that fateful evening she was supposed to have a romantic dinner date but apparently something went wrong. While most speculated it was a murder committed in a fit of passion and have a suspect in mind, Conway and Moran think there is something about this case which they couldn't put their finger on. To complicate matters, Conway feels she has seen the victim before but she couldn't remember what. As the story slowly unfolds, Conway and Moran soon learn that something bigger is playing in the center of their case and what really happened will not only rock these two detectives' worlds but to the reader as well.

Did I mention that Tana French's characterisations are amazing? I felt this latest installment was topnotch when characterisations are concerned. The mystery and the plot are there, and while they are captivating I've to confess it was the characters that made this story comes alive and yes, even believable. Tana French not only penned an intense suspense in this novel but she also offered enough doubts and betrayals, hypothetical theories to have readers' minds racing like our two detectives here, and questioning all of them along the way. The Trespasser was suspenseful but it was also intelligent and an emotional one as well. I loved this book, a lot. I think this book has surpassed In the Woods, which is my favourite French book and this said a lot.
"
"holy shit, i loved this. suspense, detectives, crime and not knowing how it was going to end. i love this series of books. can't wait for the next. Tana French is freaking great!"
"The latest installment of the Dublin Murder Squad series focuses on detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. The murder case they have been assigned is Aislinn Murray, a young woman who has been found dead in her home from head trauma. Aislinn was in a new romantic relationship and it was obvious that she had been in the middle of preparing a romantic dinner for her new boyfriend when she was killed. Her boyfriend denies responsibility advising the detectives that when he arrived at her home, there was no answer when he rang her doorbell and after waiting around for half an hour, left assuming that she was blowing him off. Her girlfriend advises that she doesn’t know why someone would want to hurt Aislinn but the detectives feel that she is withholding information. They also know the boyfriend is not telling them the whole truth and so begins the rollercoaster ride for the reader.

Antoinette and Stephen are both fairly new to the murder squad. Antoinette transferred in from Missing Persons about two years prior, however, her integration into the unit has not gone well. Subtle, and at times, aggressive harassment has occurred with no one in the squad taking responsibility leaving Antoinette unsure whether it is one person in the squad who dislikes her or whether the whole squad wants her gone. The harassment has varied from her locker being broken into and someone urinating on her personal items to her witness statements being tampered with resulting in her having to have the witness redo their statement. While Antoinette’s nature is naturally prickly and cranky, being the only woman in the unit leaves her isolated with little support other than her partner (with whom she has a good working relationship with).

At first glance, this case seems like a slam-dunk – the boyfriend must have killed her, but as the detectives dig further into Aislinn’s life they begin to question the real reason why she was killed. They even start to suspect that their unit may have been involved somehow.

Tana French is the queen of leaving the reader in suspense until the very end. You are not sure who the killer is and whether there really is something crooked going on within the squad or whether Antoinette’s paranoia is growing because of the harassment. This book left me guessing until the end and so far, is my favorite read of 2016. It is an excellent installment to her series.
"
Tana French doesn't disappoint. Her books tend to have a dark and depressing quality but they grip you right to the end.
"Tana French leads you through these detectives minds so that you feel like their steps and actions would be yours too. I love her writing and I loved this conclusion. Her work is real, she is never looking to satisfy the expectation only to tell the story in its true feeling and form."
"Best yet

It will keep you guessing until you are at 99% and you may still wonder if it is done -"
" THE TRESPASSER by Tana French is the sixth episode in her Dublin Murder Squad series. This, like all her novels, is a stand-alone story, but you might get more satisfaction reading them in order. There are some new characters here but most are names you'll know from the past. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran, last seen as the leads in Ms. French's last novel THE SECRET PLACE, are back investigating a low level domestic killing that should be open and shut. Where's the fun in that?  What should be a walk through is anything but easy, and as the pair delve into possibilities, the way to a solve grows darker and more perilous. As the pair are going off shift a murder case is handed to them. An attractive woman, Aislinn Murray, is found dead in her apartment on a Saturday night. The table is set for two but dinner was never served. She had a date with a bookstore owner named Rory Fallon. She died from a blow to the head and falling, hitting her head on the fireplace. Or Rory hit her and killed her with one stroke. Ms. French's book are not so much about the crime as it is the investigators and the suspects. Conway, only on the Murder Squad for eight months, is the victim of veiled sexual harassment. She knows she has to work though it and show she has the balls to do the job without whining. She can't trust anyone, even her partner, but she has to find a way. Plus there is the hinderance of having a senior detective assigned to assist the pair. She has to contend with his hidden motivations. There is a great deal of inner dialog her, and I felt it might have been too much. Certainly Ms. French goes to great lengths to remind the reader on every page that this is an Irish book first and foremost, that these are Irish from the hard streets, having lived through the worst and, instead of falling for the easy path, have decided to do something better for the world. This is never proclaimed openly, but it is in every chapter and it is a good thing. But the inner voice worked, you get a great understanding of the workings of this cop, and you get an amazing pay-off for your patience. This is a book to read and savor, and than reread trying to find the faults that aren't there. Enjoy! Or perhaps I should say, ""Taitneamh a bhaint as""!"
"Tana French is consistently good at writing detective stories that aren't really detective stories/procedurals. Really, they are character studies, looking at how people interact, especially when they happen to be murder squad detectives or the acquaintances of murder victims. In the Trespasser, much like her other books, the secret is not in trying to pick up on the clues dropped subtly throughout the book, the real work is learning about the characters and the way they interact to figure out what will happen next as they are mixed and matched in the course of an investigation. Here, the dialogue is sharp, the main characters full of interesting facets, and the plot close enough to realistic to make for a satisfying read. It's not so much a whodunit as a ""what will make the guilty party `fess up in the end"" kind of book. Quick tip for the audibook version - it's feels much more taut at 1.25 speed than the standard pacing."
"I really enjoyed this book and liked having a return of the two detectives from The Secret Place. This one is a bit different because it really was more about the office politics, gender and trust issues between the police officers than the murder. Each detective painted the victim with a different brush and it took awhile for them to realize that the truth was in the middle and that this case was much trickier than they had any idea of. Very, very, good to the last page.

"
Always good. I have never read a novel of hers that I didn't like (my faves are Broken Harbour and Faithful Place). Highly recommended and it is a treat if you go at them in order but it is not really necessary. 
"I'm a big fan of the Dublin Murder Squad series. After the first couple of books, I was worried that French was getting into kind of a rut in the same sorts of stories every single time. (Not that they were bad, I just worried that every case would involve something from a detective's past.) Between, this and the last in the series (The Secret Place), it is clear that my worries were unfounded.

Antoinette Conway, and Stephen Moran (who we met in the last novel, but that really doesn't matter in terms of what happens here.) are partners in the Murder Squad. Conway is hazed constantly, and that hazing has made her suspicious of everyone in the department, including, eventually her own partner.

The case they are working on seems open and shut, until weirdness starts popping up all around it. Starting with the initial interview with the best friend. Throughout the book red herrings, dead ends, and oddness is thrown at us. At some points, it seems clear from the narrative that we know exactly what is going to happen, only for that door to close and leave us guessing once again.

I always think it is a good novel about murder when the author has taken the time to draw a living picture of the victim in the case. Especially, when we are introduced to the victim after her death. We meet Aislinn Murray through the investigation. In drips and drabs we learn about her, until the end of the book when you actually feel sad that she's not along because the personality put together in these drips and drabs came together to draw a picture of a really interesting character.

Satisfying solution to the mystery, and 
also a satisfying comeuppance for McCann after Breslin saves him from Conway, and Moran. They go to the chief who surprises the characters (and me) by bringing McCann in and getting a confession. That chapter with O'Kelly wringing out the confession is a masterwork. I couldn't put the book down. I just reread it, and couldn't stop until it was finished. An amazing end to a book. Not only getting the confession, but setting Conway's attitude correctly, that not everyone was against her. Really good stuff.)"
"I read IN THE WOODS many years ago and enjoyed it. I’m not sure why I never picked up another Tana French book. Maybe because I knew it would be dense, heavy, yet totally addictive. Reading Tana French is a commitment. But I believe I picked a good one to re-enter the Dublin Murder Squad with THE TRESPASSER. I am not familiar with the characters of Detectives Steve Moran and Antoinette Conway. I hear the previous book THE SECRET PLACE is told from the POV of Moran and in this one, it’s Conway. I also had no problem getting sucked into the story so there's no need to be concerned that you have to read the previous one first.

The story starts off as a proper police procedural. Aislinn “Ash” Murray is found dead in her apartment. She’s an attractive young blonde woman or as Conway refers to her “a dead Barbie.” Everything points to her date of the evening, a stammering nervous Rory Fallon. As Conway and Moran investigate the case, they also must work with Detective Breslin, a senior officer who is essentially “babysitting” them. Conway is the only female on the squad and she’s young. This combination makes her a target for pranks and general disrespect from her team. However, is she imagining it? It could just be that she has a chip on her shoulder the size of Ireland, something French explores with delicate skill and humor.

For me, the majority of the appeal of the story is the internal conflict Conway struggles with while investigating the case. We learn her father abandoned her at a young age, much like the victim, Aislinn. Instead of desperately seeking out her father like Aislinn, Conway buries her emotions and pain deep inside, thus, her tendency to be sarcastic and surly. Her more “sensitive side” peeks through every once in a while. We see her paranoia that her squad is out to get her or her fear she won’t hack it as a detective.

The mystery behind who killed Aislinn is compelling in and of itself, but it’s Conway’s personal journey that really made this story work for me. French has such a way with language and description and really getting inside the characters’ heads that I couldn’t get enough of. Despite the 450-page length, I didn’t want it to end.
"
"Another masterpiece for Tana French. At first thot the main character was a bitter paranoid lady cop, didn't like her...but then it all morphed into the plot which was fabulous. Tana is brilliant."
"Always so compelling but a bit gritty in the squad room.
"
"Tana French is one of my favorite contemporary mystery writers. This book is listed as Dublin Murder Squad #6, but to categorize this as part of a series doesn't do it justice. Although all of French's books deal with the same murder squad, each can be read as a stand alone novel. What really separates French from most books in this genre is the psychological depth and attention to detail. Every glance, thought and conversation is steeped in mood and nuance. While I appreciate this, readers who like more action and a faster pace might find it tedious.

I've read all of French's books and especially like them on audio, which is really a compliment as a book must have great dialogue and masterful language to work in this format. The Trespasser is narrated by Hilda Fay, who does a great job capturing the distinctive personalities of each character. Some readers (myself included at times) who aren't Irish or British might struggle a little with some of the language, but I didn't find this to be a major obstacle.

The Trespasser focuses on a murder investigated by Antoinette Conway, who is dealing with personality conflicts and harrassment at the hands of her fellow detectives. This complicates the case, as she's never sure when she's being deliberately misled by her possibly treacherous co-workers in the department. The murder itself remains a mystery till close to the end.

Conway is an interesting but not always likable character. She's extremely angry and defensive. Sometimes with good reason, but her attitude also acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy at times. French, however, is an expert at creating complex characters who are smart enough to understand their own faults and struggle to overcome them. In most mystery novels, the characters are just there to move the plot along. In French's novels, it's more the other way around. These are character-driven tales where the plot is secondary, if still interesting.

I highly recommend Tana French to anyone who loves good mysteries or detective stories, especially from the British Isles. It's probably best to start with her first book, In The Woods and read them in order but, as I mentioned, each novel works perfectly well on its own."
"I loved this book – a true detective novel! This is my 6th Tana French novel – as many as she has written. I wait patiently for each one and this one was worth the wait. I was a bit disappointed in her last one, “The Secret Place,” but this one more than made up for it. In fact, I love this just as much as her first, “Into the Woods.” Why did I love this book so much? Two words: Antoinette Conway. She’s the lead detective in this story, in the Dublin Murder Squad. Like all of French’s novels, this story focuses on a pair of detectives who are working together to solve a case for the Dublin police dept., in the prestigious Murder Squad. We were introduced to Conway in the last novel, “The Secret Place,” but we really get to know her in this one. She’s a love-her-or-hate-her kind of character and I absolutely LOVED her. Yes, she’s insufferable and dramatic at times, but being a woman in an all-male job brings that out in you. I’m not even sure her feelings are an exaggeration, based on how I think a real woman would feel in her place. But her character is so much more than just a woman with a chip on her shoulder. As the story develops, so does she. The story itself is an interesting one, with lots of twists and turns. And it even has some correlations with Antoinette’s own life. Everything comes full circle in this story. I couldn’t wait to get home to read it each day! Thanks, Tana French! I’m looking forward to your next Murder Squad story! Please hurry up!"
Tana French never lets me down.
"This is an excellent addition to the Dublin murder squad series. Like the other books, the dynamics among members of the squad is a significant part of the book and would seem familiar to anyone who has to deal with significant ""office politics"", particularly what a woman faces when working in an overwhelmingly male workplace. The investigation has many twists and turns and explores the life of the murder victim as gradually revealed through friends, who like many witnesses, started off with only a hint of the truth they knew. I find this series and its complex characters, some of whom are not that likable. It kept me up late finishing it. "
"Fantastic

I love Tana French's novels. She draws her characters so thoughtfully that as a reader you feel as though you would recognize them walking into a room. The female protagonist in The Trespasser is a perfect example. I felt like I was inside her head, dealing with misogynistic colleagues, getting caught up in her own imaginings, doubting herself, developing conspiracy theories, and making plans on next steps. I loved every minute of this book."
"Obwohl es sich bei diesem Buch um einen relativ dicken Schinken gehandelt hat, habe ich ihn relativ zügig durchgelesen.

Mir haben die vielen verschiedenen Lösungsansätzen sehr gut gefallen. Zwischendrin konnte man richtig paranoid werden.

Kurz vor Ende dachte ich, dass die Übeltäter ungestraft davonkommen und alles unter den Teppich gekehrt wird. Dann wäre meine Bewertung sehr niedrig ausgefallen. Da ich hier 5 Sterne vergeben habe, lässt das Rückschlüsse auf den Schluss zu."
"Excellent Detective/Crime novel. Perhaps a bit overwrought in spots, but certainly worth this minor bump in an otherwise dead flat read. The writing, plot and characters are superb, with one of the most satisfying --- and believable --- endings I've ever encountered. Thanks to Garth for the gift book!"
"Tana French's books get categorized under murder mysteries at the book stores and libraries. In some ways, this is entirely accurate, since they are all about members of the Dublin Murder Squad. In another sense, this negatively prejudices potential readers who are not fans of that genre, since Ms. French actually writes incredible character studies about people who happen to be members of the police.

In “The Trespasser”, Ms. French continues her tradition of taking supporting characters from one book and giving them the spotlight in her current one. However, she twists the concept by using the same leads from her last book, “Faithful Place”, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran , but telling the tale from Conway's perspective rather than Moran's as in the prior book. The cast is rounded out with other members of the squad and a few suspects and potential witnesses.

One thing I dread about Ms. French's books is their length – this one was spread over 18 CDs in the audio edition I listened to. However, a large part of her books is the detailed interplay between the police and witnesses / suspects. One might be able to “edit” a 20 minute symphony by removing some aspects of the music, but the overall piece would be lesser from their absence. In the same fashion, Ms. French's ability to “conduct” an interview (pun not intended, but I'll go with it) would leave less of an impact had the conversation been shortened for publication. Each sentence, each word, and each nuance helps reflect the characters and the methods by which they are revealed.

For once, I actually figured out “whodunnit” in one of Ms. French's mysteries. I found that this did NOT lessen my enjoyment of the book, as (a) I'm usually wrong so was waiting for the point where the author pulled the rug out from under me, and (b) I totally missed out on HOW the killer was outed.

So, why are you wasting your time reading my ramblings about this book when you could be out there reading the book itself?

RATING: 5 stars. Even by the high standards set by Tana French in her earlier works.

"I love Tana French's books not so much for the mysteries -- which, don't get me wrong, are always satisfying -- but because of the way she has of bringing real, vivid characters to astonishing life.

This edition of the Dublin Murder Squad books focuses on Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Detective Steve Moran, both of whom featured in French's last book, The Secret Place. Both young and ambitious and new to the squad -- Conway with more seniority, by just an inch -- they've got problems fitting in with what Conway, especially, sees as an old boys' network, and are feeling besieged in their own squad room. And that's before they get bogged down in a case that pulls them further away from their colleagues and deeper into the past.

Being inside Conway's head was both stressful and fascinating. She's definitely a prickly personality, and the dramatic irony was maddening. This might be the first time that I was more stressed about whether a character was going to figure out her own life before she figured out the murder. There was more than once that I wanted to shake her and say ""use your detective skills to see what you're doing to yourself,"" but it was a mark of how quickly French was able to make her come to life and be a vibrant character I really did care about.

The deep dive into Conway's shuttered psyche would almost have been enough to earn this go-around five stars, but it was the tricky, twisty, slowly-unfolding whodunit that really pushed it over the top. Tying in so many strands so cleverly -- I won't spoil anything -- it really drove home thse stakes of what they were investigating, as well as brought the dead girl at the center to posthumous life.

It's certainly not the most cheerful of books, but if you are looking for something wholly absorbing to both sides of your brain, I'd recommend you start your new year off with a dose of Dublin Murder Squad."
"I like everything Tana French does, but this one was a little harder for me. I don't know that I loved the detective in this one as much as the others. Definitely a solid read, but I wonder if you'll feel the same way I did."
"**Minor, non-specific spoilers below!**

When I started reading Tana's books, I thought what I liked best were the clever, creative plots. But the more I read and revisit them, the more I realize that my favourite thing about her work is the vivid characterization. In each book she creates fully realized narrators who think, act, and speak entirely like themselves - every character sounds different and distinct from the last.

The Trespasser's Antoinette Conway is no exception. I was fascinated by the character when she was introduced in The Secret Place, and thrilled to have a story from her point of view. Antoinette has a more direct, occasionally coarse way of relating events that I felt quite realistic for a character in her position: the only woman on the Murder Squad, dealing with harassment from her co-workers and a case she can't see clearly. She's a difficult person who gets in her own way, but she's self-aware enough to realize it.

The Aislinn Murray case is another clever idea from an author whose crimes and mysteries are always ingenious. I'm not sure anything will ever top the Broken Harbour crime scene (she outdid herself there), but the case in The Trespasser is an intriguing one - a seemingly straightforward crime scene that turns out to be anything but, with just enough false leads and red herrings along the way to keep readers guessing.

I loved the atmosphere of paranoia in the book - I was never sure if Antoinette and her partner Steve were being sent on a wild goose chase, never sure if her reputation on the squad and with the Guards at large was really as bad as she thought it was. I felt there was a good balance between Antoinette's investigation and the internal squad politics.

This was one of my most anticipated books of the year, and I wasn't disappointed; Tana never lets us down!"
"If anyone can suggest a mystery writer half as good as Tana French, I would really appreciate it. This may have been my favorite of her Dublin Murder Squad series."
"Enjoyed the quips.

A good Irish read that one must interpret some of the words, but that's fun. Tho I still haven't looked up what a gaffer is. A well thought through plot and an interesting application demonstrating the paranoia we all have felt at one time or another. The lead character's comments made me laugh out loud a few times. Overall a very good read. Well done I thought."
I have enjoyed all of the books in this series and this one is no exception. The very believable characters and suspenseful plot twists keep me turning pages.
Really liked it! Looking forward to reading another Tana French novel soon.
"I received an ARC through Edelweiss through the LibraryReads program.

I am a huge fan of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, and The Trespasser did not disappoint. You don't have to have read the prior books to read this one (although I'm sure you'll want to go back and find the others after finishing). Murder Squad Detective Antoinette Conway is coming off an evening shift and is ready to head home when she and her partner Stephen Moran are given one last case. It looks like a cut-and-dried lovers' tiff gone wrong at first, but things don't entirely add up. On top that the other squad members seem to be doing their best to harass Conway into leaving. Conway is having trouble deciphering what is is true, what is misdirection meant cover up something else, and what is only her imagination. French's writing has only gotten better and The Trespasser is as taut as a drum head--the tension throughout the book is delicious. One of her biggest strengths is the impeccable Irish voices of each character, which will echo in your mind long after you finish the book.

Slightly spoiler-y:


Conway is one of my favorite characters in the series. Her voice and personality were fantastic. Another reviewer mentioned it was more in the vein of Faithful Place than some of the others in the series, and I agree. It was more psychological, more personal to Conway, and had more hair-on-the-back-of-my-neck-standing-up moments in the way that Faithful Place did (which is really saying something, since all of the books in the series have moments that make the hair on the back of my neck stand up). Lots of twists and turns but not in a gimmicky way. French does a brilliant job conveying the confusion that Conway and Moran face both from their squad members and in their own minds."
"First of all, I was eagerly waiting for this book to come out for ever-so-long. I am a huge fan of Tana French as she combines murder mystery, literary and psychological fiction and sets them in Dublin! Her characters are tough, smart and flawed, often their own worst enemies, and very relatable. Her last novel, The Secret Place was slightly disappointing, but even a disappointing TanaFrench novel is still a good read. The Tresspasser, is on par with her best. Antoinette Conway is the smartest person in the room and she knows it, but her confidence is constantly demeaned by the white male detectives she works with (she's biracial), and as a result she gets paranoid, not good when solving a murder case. She and the murder victim both have daddy issues, which makes her less than sympathetic, but , hey, she didn't get where she is by being a cream puff. The best part of the book, as with most in this series, is the relationship between her and her partner, Steven Moran, especially when they are interviewing/interrogating witnesses. It's like a symphony of psychological detective skills. Art. Much of this book is psychological, with Antoinette struggling with the inner demons of past and identity, which sometimes makes it hard to follow her gut and trust her instincts. That's what makes her character so relatable for me. While it doesn't quite live up to her masterpiece, Faithful Place, it is in the same realm as In the Woods, The Likeness, and Broken Harbour. What makes her novels so unique and anticipated, for me, is that even though they are set within the Dublin Murder Squad, each one as a different protagonist, always a minor character from a previous novel. The anticipation is already building for her next one."
"In Tana French's newest crime novel The Trespasser, the Dublin Murder Squad is at it again, this time, investigating the murder of a young, beautiful 20-something who turns up dead in her apartment. Antoinette Conway (the universally despised member of the squad) and Stephen Moran (the newbie) are the on-duty detectives when the call comes in. With other detectives questioning their decisions and pushing them toward a fast solve, Conway and Moran join forces to find out what really happened that Saturday night to the woman in her apartment.
I love Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, and I was so excited to see another Tana French book on its way out. While most of her novels have had me on the edge of my seat, unable to devote any real brain power to any activity other than reading, her last novel, The Secret Place, was something of a let down. It still circled around an interesting case and presented fascinating characters, but the novel fell a little flat for me. The Trespasser, however, was back to Tana French at her finest. The main detectives were the perfect underdogs. Conway, who had featured in The Secret Place, was the central character in The Trespasser and readers catch a glimpse of her background and get a better understanding of her place on the murder squad. The other detectives on the squad create the right amount of conflict. O'Kelly is back, still in the role of ""gaffer."" In ways, Conway reminded me a great deal of Rob Ryan, the central character in In The Woods, the first murder squad novel, and so, I expected her career to go a certain direction. I was pleased, however, to still find myself surprised by the plot and by the characters' actions. I hope to see that there are more books in the works, because this one had me riveted from page one."
"Well it only took Tana French 5-6 tries, but she finally found me a detective combo to love. The pairing of Moran and Conway in The Secret Place and then again in The Trespasser was so satisfying. I read these two books one right after the other (with all the others in the series, I waited several weeks, sometimes months, between each read), and it was a very satisfying decision to keep these two close together. This beginning didn't start out slow like all the others. And with all the others, I've been perfectly happy to leave the lead detective behind for the next book because none of them ever got me all that excited or seemed all that likable, except for the one from book 2, The Likeness. But when The Secret Place ended I did not want to leave either Moran OR Conway behind, and I was delighted to find out with The Trespasser that both would be back in the spotlight, for once.

I don't know what I can really say about this without spoiling it, and I don't want to spoil it, but FINALLY The Likeness has competition for my favorite of the series. I didn't love The Secret Place as much I as I loved this one, but the two of them together really do it for me.

For now I've reached the end of Tana French's bibliography, but her rate is approximately two years between publishing, and it's been two years since The Trespasser was published, so hopefully that means we'll get a new one at some point. I'd LOVE to keep following Conway and Moran around Ireland, especially if Frank Mackey became involved again at some point. He seems to be a character that French is attached to, since he's shown up in three of her six novels to date, and he's a great character. I always enjoy when he's on the scene. Really hope French isn't hanging up her keyboard with The Trespasser."
"[Imported automatically from my blog. Some formatting there may not have translated here.]

I got hooked on Tana French's series of novels circling around the Dublin Ireland Murder Squad: a group of detectives charged with figuring out homicides. The primary team here is the one from the previous book: Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. The tale is told with Antoinette as the first-person narrator. And she's kind of a mental can of worms, thanks to the hostile sexism she perceives from her testosterone-heavy squadmates. She's got her shields on high, looking for (expecting, really) betrayal by her peers.

The current case seems pretty straightforward: the victim, Aislinn, has expired thanks to hitting her head on her fireplace. Unfortunately, the underlying cause of that was getting punched in the face. The suspect is pretty obvious: Rory, a guy Aislinn's been seeing, had a date with her on the evening of the crime. And he's got no alibi, and he's obviously hiding something. Relative newbies Antoinette and Steve are being ""assisted"" by veteran detective Breslin, And Breslin's anxious to arrest Rory and close the case. But does he have an ulterior motive? Aislinn's best friend seems to think there was another guy in Aislinn's life, but actual evidence for his existence is difficult to find.

This is really my favorite Tana French book so far. She's an uncommonly gifted writer, especially in the parts where the first-person narrator reveals more about herself to the reader than the narrator knows about herself. And (as usual for Ms French) the Murder Squad detectives do nearly as much psychic damage to themselves as the physical damage done to the victims."
"Finally! Finally another book by French and finally another 5 star from her. The last one was a bit disappointing but it's like Tana French read my review herself and answered all my concerns in this new novel. This book was different than the past ones - less psychological thriller and more police procedural. There was still psychological stuff, but it was more in the main character's head than in the supernatural, or suggestion of it. Also, the victim's story is very psychological. We only get her story from her friend and I would rather have seen more of it before the murder but that would have given too much away.

I really loved how the two main characters worked together! French's MO in all the other books has been to take a side/minor character from the last book, and make them the protagonist in the new book. But this time we get the same two main characters back, but the POV is switched between the detectives. And I'm a little glad to stick with the same pair again - get to know them better. Even though it's harder to like Conway than Moran.

But the fabulous writing is still there, along with a really great mystery. The struggles Conway goes through as a woman in a male squad were horrifying and added a lot to the whole tone of everything. It's hard to imagine how difficult that would be to deal with, on top of such a complicated case. I love the mental & investigative process that Conway & Moran go through. It was a serious home run for me! But it wouldn't necessarily be for someone who isn't a fan of the genre.

Language, references to sex but nothing specific, obviously violence because it's a murder, but it isn't graphic at all."
"This is a really good book. It's a literary mystery - as much a character study as a crime procedural. While the focus of this book is Antoinette Conway, you get to learn a lot about her partner Stephen, and some of the older detectives that she works with. In this book, a seemingly open-shut case takes some pretty dark twists, leading to an ending that I didn't completely see coming. Stephen and Antoinette play off each other well, and both characters are believable and interesting. In the past, French has introduced elements of the supernatural or had readers suspend reality (like Rob being able to investigate his own case in 'Into the Woods'. She doesn't do that here, and I found Antoinette to be a fairly reliable narrator. The most interesting thing to me was that while I enjoyed learning about her, she was actually kind of hard to like. She has a pretty big chip on her shoulder, and I couldn't quite tell how much of her problems on the Murder Squad were caused by others' actions, or were in her head.

Once you get past the politics and personal relationships, the murder itself is pretty interesting. I had an idea where it was going, but not fully. The characters of Sophie and O'Kelly take some interesting turns. The book is a little uneven - just when I started to get restless, the story would take a turn and I'd end up staying up later just to finish the chapter.

This book stands alone, but this is a really incredible series that's worth checking out. I miss the other detectives (especially Rob and Frank), and wonder who will be the focus of the story next?"
"Tana French & Sophie Hannah are linked in my mind -- I started reading their series (both starring murder detectives and lots of twisty twists) around the same time, and I'm pretty sure I found one because the other recommended her. But while Sophie Hannah's books have been a little...lacking lately, I feel like French's just keep getting better and better.

""I live inside my own skin. Anything that happens outside it doesn't change who I am. This isn't something I'm proud of; as far as I'm concerned, it's a bare minimum baseline requirement for calling yourself an adult human being, somewhere around the level of knowing how to do your own washing or change a toilet roll. All those idiots on the websites, begging for other people to pull their sagging puppet-strings, turn them real: they make me want to spit.""

French links her novels together with same general setting (the Dublin Murder Squad), but tends to focus each new book on a new character, who may have been featured in a previous one, albeit in a smaller role. I love how this keeps things fresh, while providing the reader with a familiar background. The Trespasser starts the tough as shit Antoinette Conway (who took a supporting role in The Secret Place), trying to make a name on the Murder Squad, despite facing obstacle after obstacle from her coworkers. The case is interesting -- what appears to be a lovers' quarrel turns into so much more -- but the true story here is inside Antoinette. Her mind works constantly, looking for threats to herself and her career, and by the end she gets you so wrapped up that you have no idea who to trust. The whole book is a mindfuck, and I loved every minute of it."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE Tana French!! In this book, we return to The Dublin Murder Squad and to detectives Conway and Moran. Conway is still having a hard time being the only woman in the squad room. She hopes her next case will make her part of the group. Their new case involves the death of a woman at her home. Who killed her? Was it the secret boyfriend or a man who was falling in love with her? Why won't her best friend tell the detectives what she knows? Kept me guessing until the end. Stellar!!"
I just love her.
"I can already feel the book hangover starting.

I'm not one for police procedural detective mystery-types. You know the ones. Where the protagonist has a name like............Zap Darkstalker and he hunts down a killer who is embroiled in an underground steampunk contortionist club. You can basically swap out the adjectives and nouns in that description into whatever outlandish pattern you like and it'll fit. Not my thing.

But I love the Dublin Murder Squad books. Adore them. And they are absolutely police detective mysteries. To the core. It's right in the title.

What sets them apart is that all the characters are REAL, including the victims. There's nothing particularly outlandish about their deaths (although The Secret Place was a bit of an odd departure). And the detectives are sometimes unreliable narrators, full of their own character flaws and insecurities.

Antoinette is tough to like because, well, she's tough. Thorny, even. Tough enough that you have as hard a time as she does deciding whether her persecution is real or imagined. That helps the story move and it certainly helped me to stay sucked in. Reading these books, and this one in particular, requires all of my brain. Everything moves so fast. The dialogue, which is whip-quick and witty, the mystery itself, the theories surrounding it, and Antoinette's ever-shifting self-evaluation.

I'm sad it's over and I'm sad I'll have to wait who knows how long for French's next offering because she is consistently spectacular."
"Tana French is one of my favorite mystery authors, I've never felt let down by any of her books. She is one of those authors that is able to retain a consistent quality throughout her novels. When I heard she had a new Dublin Murder Squad book coming out I made sure to get my hands on it as soon as it came out. Once again, I was not disappointed. Antoinette Conway was a really standout character in The Secret Place and it seemed only the natural next step to make her the point of view character of The Trespasser. She and Steve make a good balanced pair. His sympathetic qualities are a good counter to her no nonsense, seemingly bitchy approach to detective work. Even so, getting into her mind was really unique in understanding what makes her as tough as she is as well as seeing how she thinks of the other characters. French's plots move a little slower than a standard murder mystery narrative, but that is only to serve the purpose of making them more realistic and getting into the details of the setting and characters. She has a great talent in immersing the reader in Dublin and its characters that make it all really interesting and appealing. I'd rather have a slower narrative, but better quality. Some of the themes in The Trespasser were infidelity, internal corruption, and indulging fantasies. These all culminate in an exciting mystery with murder, stalking, paranoia, and secrets. I recommend The Trespasser to current Tana French fans. It won't disappoint. Also, mystery readers at large will love the book because her mix of detective novel with a touch of the literary. "
"Although I liked The Secret Place the esoteric/magical stuff therein pissed me off slightly. Therefore, I am quite happy that in her current novel French returned to the more solid and tangible atmosphere resembling Broken Harbour, which I adored.

What Tana French routinely accomplishes with crime novels reminds me of the style of Arjen Robben, soccer player of Bayern Munich. Robben usually plays on the right wing, often cuts inside on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position using his speed and dribbling skills to get rid of defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal. Everybody knows about his trick, the players on the other team must be well aware of and prepared for it, yet Robben can regularly pull it off. In the same fashion, one could pretty well tell in advance the key ingredients any Tana French novel operates with: a pair of detectives investigating a murder case, going through complicated brainstorming and intricacies, working in a hostile and/or controversial environment, hitting some dead ends and having to make some U-turns before finally getting the solve. Yet, that very same scheme always works for me just wonderfully, I do not think I could ever get bored with French's amazing character descriptions."
"Sarah contributed this review to Really Into This

Check out all of our reviews at https://reallyintothis.com
Happy Reading, friends!

This was my first Tana French novel. I definitely need to get with the program, right? This book is #6 in her Dublin Murder Squad Series. I’ve got two of her novels at home that were HIGHLY recommended by a former patient of mine & I’m moving them up the TBR pile after reading this.

I can’t elaborate too much on the story because it is complicated, detailed & intricately woven together. It starts simple enough with a dead gal in an apartment that seems like a domestic crime. But as the 2 detectives piece together the clues, it becomes a real challenge for Antoinette & Steve to sort through all the possible scenarios. French’s writing style takes the reader through every twist & turn & this includes some great dialogue amongst the Murder Squad. If you enjoy police procedurals & love Law & Order I would think this would be up your alley. This book is over 450 pages, (a bit long for me) & requires some dedication & patience from the reader. The pay off is the cast of well written characters. I mean, Antoinette is one tough & ballsy detective- she’s someone you won’t soon forget. She was definitely my favorite part of the book. I can’t imagine fans of French’s work would be disappointed with The Trespasser. It delivers a well crafted mystery as promised.

Special thanks to the First to Read program through Penguin Random House for the Advanced Readers Copy."
My favorite of the murder squad books. 
"A week of my life well-spent

From the intro of the first volume of Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, I was swimming with her in the deep end of the pool. French has an uncanny insight into childhood, friendship and alienation that touch memory and soul, taking you back pain, losses, and joys.

Each book jumps through time, as they introduce you to various characters of the murder squad, sometimes with different partners, always presenting fascinating cases. Men and women of the squad unravel the solutions through examinations of alibis and propose lines of thought and possible scenarios as they tirelessly dig into detailed investigations that unfold, solving complex puzzles. Even more intriguing are the evolving relationships between detectives and suspects.

These are not your typical police procedures. The books are elegantly plotted, characterizations are perfect, Dublin life is richly textured, and there are so many possible solutions, you won't solve the case before French decides you will.

She is a stellar writer. Enjoy her work. She is a joy to read. Odd, a datective novel as literature? You bet!
KL

PS—As of May 2024, the Starz series, Dublin Murders, based on French's series, is still being shown. It combines several of the related books and so far, (episode 5) is doing a credible job. Read the books first though. The Irish accents are authentic and challenging to the American ear. It helps if you are certain you know what's happening. Enjoy the series as well. KL"
"I feel like I need to go back and read all of Tana French's work. But I'm fairly certain this was my favorite. The plot isn't as splashy and there's not as much action as her past books, but the investigation itself has a life and character all its own. And I loved Antoinette. #tanafrenchfanforlife"
"Another terrific addition to the Dublin Murder Squad. This one brings back Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran from The Secret Place for another crime, though switches the narrator to Conway, who is almost paranoid about the people she works with and their intentions towards her based on incidents from her time in Murder. She and Moran are handed a case and overseen by a particularly annoying detective who seems to have his own agenda. The weave of the case through the book along with concerns about dirty cops was interesting as it took turns and wound back to initial suspicions even in the face of doubt. The ultimate end of the case was surprising, but handled well. The relationship between Moran and Conway is nice--they are working together but not as closely as we saw Cassie and Rob (please come back to us, btw!) in the first book. This is still a partnership that is maturing and has the potential to be really strong. I was happy to see that French didn't even hint at anything romantic or sexual happening between these two--that trope gets stuck in way too often in male-female friendships/partnerships.

I only have one complaint and it is because I listened to the audiobook instead of reading it myself.
I wasn't thrilled with this narrator to begin with, but she reads so deathly slow that I had to increase the speed on my audible to 1.25x or I'd be listening to it half my life.

I do hope we continue to see more of then books."
"The only, and I mean the ONLY reason it took me 3 days to read this book is because I have kids who think they have to eat and stuff. I really need to teach them to cook.

That said, man ... I keep fearing the time I pick up a Tana French book and she's lost her touch. You know? The mystery, the suspense, just aren't happening. I don't click with the characters, whether to want to pal with them or punch them. The time when within a few pages I'm all ""duh"" and can move on.

Thankfully, that has yet to happen. In fact, Ms. French may just be getting better and better. Her characters are so rich, so extremely well developed, that even when you *think* you know, you don't really. They act like real people, not just doing what moves the story along, but doing what their personality dictates, even if it muddies up the waters. Which, of course, also serves the story by strengthening the mystery.

Tana French knows how to weave a mystery that has layered without being convoluted. You can kid yourself into thinking you know just what's going on, only to find out the next page that you couldn't have been more wrong. Her settings draw you in, putting you right into the scene with the characters, making her books experiences.

I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't a huge fan of French's Dublin Murder Squad series, but make no mistake. This book is as good as the previous. There's no falling off, no getting lazy with plot or characters. This book with be a reread for definite."
"As soon as I closed this book, I opened up Amazon to order the first book in the series. Tana French's gift for plot and language blew me away.

The murder case in question is a simple one. Aislynn Murray has been murdered in what looks like an open-and-shut case of domestic violence. Antoinette Conway, a hard-edged murder detective who doesn't have time for silly things like feelings and friendships, is working the case with her partner Moran. Conway gets no respect from the men on the squad, and she's got some demons that she'd like to shove down deep -- mainly, her missing father.

French manages the twists and turns of the case expertly -- her experience with crime fiction shines through in the sheer competence of the plot. However, it's her skill with language and character development that sets The Trespasser apart from other mysteries in the genre. French reveals Conway's psyche to us slowly, and Conway's just enough of an unreliable narrator to keep things interesting. She isn't particularly lovable, or even likeable, but she's something much better -- dark, wounded, fiercely independent, sharp as a tack. Beyond Conway, the cast of characters is kept small, and at 449 pages, there's plenty of time to get to know each of them.

French's vivid descriptions of Dublin in winter, along with dialogue peppered with delightful Irish slang, give the novel a real sense of place. French has crafted an un-put-down-able crime novel."
"Tana French is a psychological genius. Her characters are incredibly relatable and well developed with their own subplots and growth.

As someone who has read all of Tana French's novels, I was very excited for The Trespasser to be released. For me, Tana brings the Dublin Murder squad to life in a way that few other authors have been able to achieve.

The Trespasser surpassed my expectations. My favorite books in the murder squad series were In the Woods and The Likeness, with the other books falling just slightly short of REALLY captivating me as a reader. Whatever lull I experienced over the last few books is gone. The Trespasser pulled me in and once I hit the 50% mark I suddenly found myself unable to do anything except read.

Definitely take the time to go read this book. If you're still wondering, here are a few gem lines:

""If you want to kill someone, have enough respect for my time to make it someone, anyone, other than the most gobsmackingly obvious person in the world.""

""It was about the same thing as everything else humans have done to each other since before history began: power. It was about deciding who would be the alpha dogs and who would be at the bottom of the pile.""

""We sit there, drinking, while the stuff we should probably be saying out loud gets itself done in the silence."""
"This Tana French book felt the most like the first one, and I loved it. I'm not one for murder mysteries or series, but these books are all so well paced and the characters are so well developed that I can't wait for each one."
"Love her books! Audible version outstanding. The characters, the location, the story. "
"Tana French advanced to my favourite crime author very quickly when I read her entire Dublin Murder Squad series in 2017. Somehow, it started out with a five-star read with “In The Woods” but it still got better and better from there. Trespasser might be my favourite in the series yet.
Antoinette, the female main character of this book is one of my favourite book characters of all time now. I don’t think I’m even reading Tana French’s books to guess whodunnit but because of her characters – although – the murder mystery did keep me guessing too. I don’t understand how French releases one book after another that is so well-crafted and full of interesting characters. Characters, that are complex and infuriating and lovable at the same time. During the course of the book murder detective Antoinette goes down in a spiral of self-destruction, of mistrust, paranoia and self-doubt as she is trying to figure out her latest case with her partner Steve. Somehow, I was there with her at every step and every decision - getting sucked right in. ""The Trespasser"" gripped me in such an intense way I couldn’t put the book down, which is also remarkable since Tana French’s crime novels are always rather slow-paced.

If you enjoy the genre you can’t go past Tana French. If you’re not sure which book of her to pick up first start either at the beginning with In the Woods or with “Trespasser”.

"5 stars.

Tana French has done it again! She is easily becoming one of my favorite authors.

On the sixth installment of her Dublin Murder Squad series the story follows Detective Antoinette Conway. One great thing about this series is that you in no way need to read the books in order. While some of the characters remain the same throughout the series, each book has a different protagonist.

When Detective Conway and her partner, Detective Moran, get assigned to the death of Aislinn Murray they are less than thrilled. Both, detectives think they are getting stuck with another boring domestic murder. Conway because she knows being the only female on the force has made her a target and Moran because he is knew in Murder. At first the case appears straight forward but as the detectives dig into who Aislinn truly was they begin to have their doubts. With pressure mounting from their superior and another detective assigned to the case to make an arrest, will they charge the man whom the evidence points to or will they follow their gut and potentially risk their careers to find out what really happened that night.

Wonderfully developed characters, a thrilling plot, and just the right amount of humor and creepiness the Trespasser needs to be added to your to read list now!

"Thank you to Edelweiss and the publisher for providing a digital ARC in exchange for an honest review.

It really doesn't get better than Tana French. She is the most consistently incredible author who I have read. I've yet to rate a book of hers below 5 stars, and I honestly can't imagine it ever happening; she's that good. Her latest offering is no different. It follows Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran, working what seems at first glance like yet another domestic gone wrong, which they are always being stuck with. Conway is such a great character. She's brash, sarcastic, angry at the world, and amazing. All that should make her unlikable makes you love her as a character because French's characterization of her is so rich and fascinating. Moran is her polar opposite, but they work beautifully together as partners. French is a master at the mystery/thriller/police procedural genre, and she is maybe at her best even with this latest. I very highly recommend this and all of her Murder Squad books. While they are a series of sorts, they can be read out of order. Each book features a different detective who has been introduced in an earlier book, but they can easily be read out of order without any confusion.

Pre-order this one, as it will be out in October.

"While I intend to write a legitimate, comprehensive review of this novel when I have a bit more time (cue internal cackling; I'm in that stage of PhD thesis writing where it feels like there will never be time for anything but THESIS), I wanted to get a few brief thoughts and reactions down before my memory inevitably fails me.

Most importantly, while I found the actual murder investigation plot of this novel less engaging than French's previous novels - I'm still trying to pin down exactly why that is, just a gut reaction at the moment - I was completely, and completely unsurprisingly, suckered in by the recurring theme of ""stories."" Listen to this fascinating bit, the idea itself made all the more compelling by the tinge of the narrator's own paranoia in her description: ""Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too"" (387). If nothing else, I love the way that Tana French consistently engages, in really sophisticated ways, with the ""unreliable narrator"" trope."
"Five or so years back when I came upon this series I never would have dreamed that it would become my favorite mystery/thrillers series to date. I've LOVED each book in the series and this one was no different, loved it. I recommend this series to everyone I come across who says they're a mystery/thriller fan. Each book is a standalone and set in different circumstances with different characters so you don't need to read each book but IMO the whole series is excellent.

In this book two underdog detectives fairly new to the murder squad, one dealing with vicious pranks and ongoing harassment and the other just trying to keep the peace and get them on the right track so they get better cases and some respect. Hoping for a big case to land on their desk one day soon...When a case looks like an open and shut case but thoughts of something more sinister come in to play they'll have to figure out if it's all part of the pranks and harassment or if it's something much darker that can change everything.

This was a great read. I really loved the series and this book was a great addition to it. I LOVED it. It had me interested from start to finish. As usual, it had a great plot, great character building, great characters and well written. I'd highly recommend this book or any in this series for any mystery/thriller fans."
"My first foray into Tana French's crime novel territory and I've already booked some of her earlier books through my local library. The Trespasser is French's latest and features the character Antoinette Conway, who is a detective on the Murder squad in Dublin. Conway and her partner Steve Moran are thrust into a fresh murder case as they're finishing their overnight shift. She is the sole female in the squad and feels that she is on the outer with the rest of the crew. The murder is of a young attractive woman who is found dead in her own home. The squad heavyweight leans on Conway and Moran to charge Rory, a young man who had a dinner appointment with Aislinn, the murdered woman but who says he didn't go inside her apartment let alone murder her.
The tension literally lifts off the page as the two detectives start to suspect an alternative scenario for the murder and gradually their intuition leads them to evidence that supports their theory. The situation between Conway and the rest of the murder squad is an ever-present problem but in the end their theory becomes firmer and leads us to a conclusion that blows the Murder squad apart.
Tana French is a very talented writer and her characters and dialogue really deliver in The Trespasser which has already shot to the Best Seller lists in the States and beyond."
"What is the hold this series has on me? I literally can hardly wait for each new book. I love these Irish murder squad detectives, with their dogged tenacity, their squad room squabbles, their tight ties to their partners. Tana French captures their world, their language (why does foul language sound so ""charming"" when expressed in Irish slang?), their cagy investigative and interview techniques. Antoinette Conway returns in this installment - she's tough, she's abrasive, she's paranoid, and has a huge chip on her shoulder... but she is GOOD at her job. Fighting the male dominated murder squad, her own demons, and the temptation to accept the obvious solution to the death of a beautiful young woman, Antoinette is one of the best fictional detectives ever! The characters are the focus of these stories and the interview scenes in this book are some of the best I've read.

I wish I hadn't discovered this series when the first book came out in 2008 - the wait is too agonizing between installments. I'd love to have experienced these in one big binge reading session! I think I would probably end up accepting that they are all 5-star books for me instead of the 4's I've been giving them. I'll start with this one - just because I know I love this author! And the audio versions are perfection!"
"Well, what can I say? I loved this novel. It really isn't a thriller, it's a novel about a sad death and the police officers who have to deal with it.

When relative newcomers Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran draw an assignment to investigate what looks like a routine domestic murder, they have no idea what a gigantic can of worms has just opened up. When a senior detective is assigned to ""mentor"" them through the investigation, they quickly realize that they are being pressured to charge the prime suspect just a bit too quickly for their comfort. When they resist, it gets ugly.

What I loved about the book was not the plot but the rest of it. The relationship between Antoinette and Steve is never easy. She is caustic, difficult and paranoid, while he is patient, easy-going and likeable. This makes it seem like Steve is a pushover, but no such thing: he simply goes at things from a different angle.

The resolution of the story is written in such a heartbreakingly poignant way that I actually felt sorry for the bad guys. Their humanity was not obscured by their wrongdoing. They weren't cliches. That takes serious talent in a police procedural. Ironically, the least sympathetic character in the book, at least for me, was Aishlinn. To me she seemed almost psychotic and was very unlikeable. What a terrific addition this book is to the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"I didn't gobble this book up in one or two sittings -- which means it's pretty crazy that I ended up giving it 5 stars. This is a book that one can only view its brilliance by viewing its totality. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

What Tana French has done here is taken a sub-genre of mystery novels and conducted a master class. This is a Police Procedural with capital P's. Full stop. To anyone who has ever written a police procedural, she has just slammed this down on the desk and said ""ok, everyone, here's how it's done."" And she's right.

She's also continually insightful with her characters and fluid with her language. All of that is here. It's not the kind of ""murder mystery"" that grips you around the throat from the first chapter and won't let you go - but that's not what it's trying to be. This is French once again deliberately flaunting her versatility and breadth of knowledge of the mystery genre. Not every person likes every one of her books - but she doesn't care. These books are mysteries for real mystery nuts. Those of us who don't just read them, but study them. She can take a particular style, pick it clean, spit out the bones and move on the next one. Maybe you're not always on a roller-coaster ride of excitement, but you WILL recognize her mastery .... she'll make sure of that, always."
"Another utterly fantastic entry in the Dublin Murder Squad. As far as I can tell, Tana French can do no wrong with this series. I have adored every single book, and this one is no exception. I loved the look we got into Conway in the previous book, and having her be the star of this one was a treat. She's a take no-shit detective, and I loved her partnership with Moran. They make one hell of a team, and I can only hope that we'll get more of them down the line. If not, then I'm real curious of who will be the main character in book seven.

This book had a great little mystery that presented itself as a simple domestic gone wrong, and ended up blowing up in a way that captivated my attention from the get go. The victim especially ended up being a completely fascinating character, and every time we peeled away another layer to her story, I couldn't wait to learn more. I cannot put these books down when I start them, and I love going back after the book has ended and finding all the little clues that French sprinkles throughout. I never feel like the endings are unearned, and I always come away wanting more of her dark and fascinating world.

Either way, if you like good twisty mysteries, with a rotating cast of fantastic characters, then you can't go wrong with the Dublin Murder Squad. Now only to wait anxiously for book seven."
"Tana French is one of my very favorite crime novelists, and The Trespasser finds her at the top of her game. Although Moran and Conway--my favorite French team!--are the primary detectives, The Trespasser is quite different from the preceding novel in the Dublin Murder Squad series, The Secret Place. Whereas The Secret Place focuses much more on the targets of the investigation, The Trespasser is more of a standard police procedural, with long stretches of salty dialogue. The story is told entirely from Conway's point of view, which contributes to the sense of paranoia. Conway can't trust her primary suspect, obviously, but she also has reason to mistrust her team, even at some points her own partner.

French's style shifts quite a bit among her books, which makes sense, given her commitment to point of view. Conway's voice is distinctive: not quite French's own voice, but still incisive and original. French's skill comes across in the many subtle ways she reminds us that Conway, whip-smart though she may be, isn't infallible. Just like anyone, Antoinette Conway is a product of her own life experiences, which reflect her biases and emotional limitations. I really hope that the next book in the series gives us more Conway and Moran; French's other detectives are great, but I have grown ridiculously fond of this pair."
"This book is about Antoinette Conway, the sole woman on the Dublin Murder Squad. She is wrought with impatience and bitterness and almost always displays paranoid tendencies. As she and her partner navigate through what appears to be a straight-forward case of domestic violence, poor Antoinette is forced to stare down many of her own demons. She plays daily mind games with herself and uses impatience as a defense mechanism. As she unravels the case, what she discovers is almost too tough for even her to face, but yet she forges ahead and puts her own career on the line because it's the right thing to do.

I loved this book. It was so full of rich detail that I felt like I was right there with Antoinette as she played paranoid scenarios in her head. I felt the stress and distrust that swirled around the police station, especially in the case room. I felt the deep-seeded ""patheticness"" of the murderer. I felt the looming despair and hurt experienced by Antoinette when she knew she would never hold the loyalty and respect that existed between the men on her squad. There are so many complex issues throughout this book that made each character unique, each chapter different, each paragraph hinged on human frailty and weakness, and then the desire to do better. This book is quite lengthy, but it was well worth the read."
"What a great book. I don't want to say much that could reveal plot twists. The writing is so crisp, the characters are developed so well, the dialogue is so well done, and there is never a false note. The central character is so compelling. The author avoids implausible plot twists and instead comes up with a story that is believable and makes a reader care about what happens to the characters in her novel."
"With every Dublin Murder Squad book I read, I'm more and more in love with Tana French. I did start reading the series out of order with this one and I'm not sure that was the right call, but regardless I really really REALLY enjoyed this book. Even when I think I'm not enjoying the characters or the story, I still just can't seem to put a Tana French book down—I don't know how she does it!

I was a little bit worried that Antoinette Conway was going to be just another version of Cassie Maddox (of In the Woods and The Likeness), and that French would start to become kind of one-note for me. And while they definitely are similar characters, they are distinct enough and the stories different enough that it still all felt new and great. I love French's setup of keeping with the Murder Squad but featuring different detectives every time; it makes every book stand on its own, but still gives the reader that happy pleasant feeling of being swept up in a series.

The case in this book definitely kept me hooked, too. In the first two I read, the featured cases were kind of weird anomalies in the detective world; so I liked a bit of change of pace in this book, when the case (though perhaps not its resolution) was pretty standard, and coming to the end required good-old-fashioned detective work. Which I love. More Tana, pleaseeeeee and thank you."
"Some books take chapters and chapters for me to get familiar with the main character's personality, get my head around the settings, and dive into the story itself. For some books, these things don't even happen and I end up marking those books with 1 or 2 stars. I don't know what it is with Tana French novels but I get sucked in to the story from page 1. It's so easy to picture everything in my head and I always end up loving all the characters despite their flaws and complications.

I loved this as I did all the other stories in the series and I'm genuinely really sad that Dublin Murder Squad #7 hasn't been out in the world yet. I've read a lot of good books and I have many favourites but Tana French has introduced me a new flavour and I can never un-taste it. I don't have anyone around me that has told me that they've read Tana French and I would really love them to. BUT, if any of my friends come to tell me that they didn't enjoy it, I would literally stop being friend with them. That's how much I lover her books! I tend to judge people by their favourite books or movies, and I'm not even ashamed of it.

Ever since I started reading this series, the bar for my expectations for any stories has risen a notch and if I keep being unsatisfied after finishing a book, I blame Tana French! Please hurry up and publish the 7th book."
"*** April 2020 re-read ***

Oh joys! Antoinette Conway is back, and so is her partner Stephen Moran, in this sixth entry in the Dublin Murder Squad series. French's trademark bleakly lyrical prose, her enthralling, heartbreaking character studies, and satisfyingly complex crimes. But, much as with the BBC police procedural series Line of Duty, it is the relationships between police officers, their partners, supervisors, and peers, that provide the real crux of the narrative. Spoilers follow:

Oh my. Tana French's partnerships do not generally end well, and I was rooting for Antoinette and Steve, while knowing in my heart that this was not going to end well for either of them. They already had one happy ending in book 5, surely this would be where it all unravels. But no! One of the most satisfying resolutions I could have hoped for, while still being utterly believable and in no way saccharin. Amazing.

Much as I'd love to read more of this series, this book had the feeling of completion. I wonder if we will be hearing more from the Dublin Murder Squad. Much as I'd like to, if this is the last of them, it was a wonderful place to end this journey. I'll be re-re-reading these again soon.
"
"Tana French gets people. Her books are murder mysteries, but they're psychological and complex and you just get to know her characters so damn well. Each novel has a new narrator - someone who was a background character from a previous book. They take place in Dublin, and I LOVE the Irish vernacular and slang. In The Trespasser, Conway is the only female detective on the murder squad and she's subject to pranks, harassment and straight-up sabotage from the men she works with. She's smart, sarcastic, understandably bitchy, but practically paranoid. Not only is she the lead detective in a frustrating and intricate murder case, but she's simultaneously fighting against the ""boys club"" squad members and those that she thinks are out to put her in her place. She's burned out and edgy and she doesn't even know who or what to believe anymore. Who can she trust? ""Every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too."" "
"This book gets 5 stars out of admiration. I mostly enjoyed it, got pretty deeply immersed, but in a troubling way. The outward mystery--the murder our detectives want to solve--is compelling, but there is also a relentless sense of ""what is really going on here?"" at all levels. Antoinette Conway, the lead detective and the only viewpoint in the novel, is cynical and paranoid about everything--but to what extent does she have good reason to be? And is there a possibility that people around her are trying to make her more suspicious than she has cause to be? Are they trying to distract her? What happens to your perspective when you can't trust anyone, even the one person you do trust?

The audio narration is quietly understated in a way that keeps reminding you that you are inside the head of someone who who is always looking over her shoulder and who has a brooding, unpeaceful mind. I really appreciated this after having recently listened to too many books where the narration seemed overdramatized, but again, this is not an easy perspective to be held inside. While I was immersed I felt I was carrying around something heavy, a heavy thing I could not lay down because it was so interesting."
"If this book weren't written by Tana French, it might pass for a garden-variety murder mystery. But it was and it is not. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are disappointed as the book begins, having been handed what sounds like an open and shut domestic murder case. A good-looking young woman named Aislinn Murray is found dead in her apartment on a Saturday night. The table is set for two, and dinner is shriveling in the kitchen. She appeared to have a date with a bookstore owner named Rory Fallon, and she evidently died from a blow to the head. So either she fell and hit her head on the fireplace, or Rory came over and hit her. End of story? No way. There is much more to the story and even the detectives of the Murder Squad are not above suspicion. This is one of the best books in the series."
"A young woman, Aislinn Murray, has been murdered. Obviously she had been expecting company as the table was set for two and dinner was in the oven, but the young man Rory, who was expected had knocked and called and found no one home. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are assigned to the case and they are deliberate and thoughtful in executing their investigation. However, Detective Breslin, far their senior, is in a hurry to assign blame to Rory and be done with it. He and Conway interview Rory and it's an excruciating interview. Rory is a sweet, naive guy and doesn't know what's hit him.

The Trespasser pushes the reader/listener along as Breslin pushes Rory in a sadistic manner, Detective Conway's emotions flare as she resents the treatment she's receiving from Breslin and has received since she joined the murder squad, and Conway and Moran change theories in their search to discover what really happened. I wish I had already read some of the previous books in the series, but it did stand on it's own quite well. I listened to the audiobook which was excellently narrated by Hilda Fay. Only occasionally did I not understand the narrator's Irish accent or idioms."
"The most perfectly titled novel I've read in, mm, ever."
"Like all Tana French books, this one is addictive. I had to force myself to go to bed last night, but of course I got up this morning and finished it with my morning coffee.
I like this book more than the past few because I thought the narrator was more complicated and interesting. She's not likable, but she's not unlikable either. The story reveals her weaknesses and inconsistencies, and as readers we're able to see her flaws and mistakes, which makes for an interesting read. Like any book by French, there are twists and turns. I was second guessing the detectives the whole way through.
I liked the plot of this book a lot. There were many interesting sub-plots, many interesting characters and situations.
I think this is her best book since....ah, I don't know. My favorite of her books is still The Likeness (I know! I know! but still). My least favorite was Broken Harbor. I would put this one up there with Likeness and In The Woods, which is maybe my second favorite.
If you like Tana French, of course you HAVE to read this. If you haven't read her, lucky you, you get to start at the beginning.
But yes, highly recommended!"
"I have read all of Tana French's books. This is her best, in my opinion. A haunting book, beautifully written. This mystery has a complex plot that is intertwined with the ups and downs of the relationship between two detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad, Anoinette and Stephen, as they try to solve the murder of a young woman. The case originally seems simple to solve, but they resist the pressure to reach the easy solution, and get enmeshed in a situation that threatens their position in the squad . As in all her books, Tana French takes time to develop her plot as well as her characters, so that you feel as if you know them intimately; their weaknesses, doubts triumphs and failures affect you on a deep level as you move along through the book. We see the case though Antoinette's eyes, and she comes through as a very real human being in all her insecurities, fears, and anger. By the end of the book, she, as well as the reader has discovered a new truth about herself. The twists and turns of the plot kept me at the edge of my seat for the week that it took me to read this book. "
"Another crime fiction buff I know was underwhelmed by this Tana French thriller, but for me it's her best yet. There's a sophistication in the writing here and I love the pace.

Deep, dark and subtle, this is the story of two underdog murder squad detectives' determination to uncover the truth of what happened to a seemingly ubiquitous blonde found dead in her living room, all dressed up for a romantic meal at home that never happened.

This book is called The Trespasser; and the metaphor rings more than once... 'forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us'. This book examines what happens when we don't/can't/won't forgive and the spiralling destruction that anger lets loose, careering into those in its path, raining down devastation on the innocent and guilty alike.

The dialogue in this book is near perfect and the police interview scenes masterpieces. Achingly tense, fiercely detailed and deftly handled.

I've now read everything Ms French has so far published. For me, The Trespasser is a gear-change up and an acceleration towards great, great storytelling of the kind only authors like Henning Mankel ever achieve. Love it!"
"Dublin Murder Squad #6. Reading ""Faithful Place"" (#3) and ""The Secret Place"" (#5) first is recommended. If you like those, you'll like this.
"
I really enjoyed this book. It lived up to the quality I have come to expect from Tana French. 
Sublime
"Foul-mouthed ""skanger"" that she is, Antoinette Conway, biracial sole woman newbie on the Murder Squad fights an uphill battle every day against the whole world--giving no quarter to her partner Steve Moran or anyone else-- and narrates this account of a cut-and-dried homicide. Her sharp eyes and quick wit keep the chuckles coming while the plot twists and turns. Now I know why everyone loves Tana French!

""I'm amazed that this guy manages to get out of bed in the morning without working himself into a panic attack over the chance that he might trip on the bath mat and stab himself through the eye socket with his toothbrush and be left with a permanent twitch that'll ruin his chances of landing an airplane safely if the pilot has a heart attack and doom hundreds to a fiery death."" p. 118 Chapter 4

""I see me tilting like a hawk high in warm air, while below me he unrolls all my might-have-beens, for me to circle above at my leisure till every fork and tributary is stamped into my mind, reclaimed and mine. I see him opening his cloak to show me all the lost pages of my story written in silver on the night-sky lining."" p. 331 Chapter 13"
"This was my first Tana French book, but it will not be my last. She is a smooth writer, and easy to read, even with the odd [to me] 'language'. I enjoyed looking up some of the words, of the Irish culture and sound? Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, are on the Murder Squad in Dublin and are assigned the homicide of a young girl presumably killed by her date/boyfriend who was scheduled to be at her home for dinner on the night she died. When he arrived and she didn't answer the door, he texted her and left. From there, the plot thickens.

Ordinarily, when someone starts her sentences with 'me' doing this and 'me' going here or there, I can only tolerate it briefly. But in this book, the slang fits Detective Antoinette and her character emerges. She pulls no punches but is a likeable main first person character. Add Dublin castle, a single woman fighting her way in an all-male police squad, and good writing, and the book is one I didn't put down...

I was the lucky winner of this uncorrected proof in a Goodreads giveaway."
"I will pretty much love anything Tana French ever writes just because her style is so elegant. That said, The Trespasser felt a little bit forced, almost as if she's ready to move on. Six books and nearly ten years in, this might be expected. The Trespasser brings the book nicely full circle, depicting the beginning of a strong male-female partnership in the way that the first book, In the Woods, depicted an ending. In between, we've seen the results of isolation and avoidance in solo characters, and a slow coming around back to trust.

The story itself is a bit on the thin side compared to previous books and cases. That isn't to say it's without French's knack for twists and turns; there just seem to be fewer of them. Then again, the revelations at the end threaten to go much deeper than previous repercussions have, not just for the characters but also for their squad. As with all of French's books, I miss the characters now that I'm done with the story, and I'm looking forward to whatever she has in store next -- in or outside of the Dublin Murder Squad."
"I'm already in a book-hangover waiting for Tana French's next book. She has become one of my favorite authors over the last few years. She has such a unique take on the typical crime/thriller/mystery that is more about character development and subtle tension and suspense than over-the-top plot twists and action. All her characters feel completely real, none are too ""perfect,"" all are perfectly-flawed. The events leading up to the climax make sense and logically build on one another, these are well-thought out and plotted mysteries. The Trespasser is no exception, I thought I knew exactly where she was going and by the end I was totally proven wrong. This isn't the first time one of her books have done this for me. I think French is very aware of what ""savvy"" crime-readers look for as twisty plot devices and cleverly uses this against us. The Trespasser had me hooked from the first page and didn't let me go, it felt much shorter than its 400+ pages. I hope Tana French has a very long and very successful career, I know I will be reading everything written by her."
"Sometimes, when you wait for a book long enough, it’s impossible for it to live up to the expectations you’ve developed. I think that happened here. I loved the book, loved the story, but when considered against Tana French’s other books, it paled a little in comparison.

In French’s characteristic style, she’s deep inside her character’s head. The character is well developed. She knows who this person is. But I almost got the impression that she didn’t like this character as much as the others whose point of view she’s written from in the past. Maybe it’s me, though – maybe my interpretation is skewed.

Another thing missing from this book is the hint of the supernatural. Please don’t misunderstand, French never goes fantasy or sci-fi or horror, and maybe supernatural is the wrong word to use, but there’s usually a finely woven thread of otherness, the strange or unexplainable, that creates an added depth to her work. Still, a 5 star book that I recommend to my fellow mystery lovers."
"I've noticed Tana French books numerous times in the past and carried on without picking one up for no particular reason. Why did I let this quality writer slip through my fingers?!? Now that I have read one of her books I see what a real mistake that was.

These Irish police procedurals (The Trespasser is number six in the Dublin Murder Squad series) are different from others I have enjoyed. They feel more personal in a warts and all sort of way that is hard to describe. The story is absorbing. It focuses on characters rather than shock value. We see how the investigation shifts through the eyes of the detectives looking for the truth. They are tired, fed up with internal politics and not shy about sharing their thoughts and insight.

I expect I've made a error jumping into the series mid stream but I don't feel too bad about it as I can now go back and read up on the previous books. I'm thrilled with the prospect of this and the future reading enjoyment I will find thanks to the labours of Ms. French! Great stuff."
"I loved this book. After the first couple in this ""series"", I've pretty much loved all of Tana French's books. I loved the main characters in this one (Conway and Moran), I loved the mystery. I loved that there was nothing supernatural, and no big leaps of narrative faith to take. It is explainable. It is based in the laws of physics and could actually happen. The worst part about this book is having to wait forever for the next one. Which, if she follows the formula, who is the next perspective to write from? Breslin? She made him pretty unlikable. The gaffer would be interesting, but since he doesn't do cases, that could be difficult. Unless he gets pulled in on something high profile or something like that. But his character was always really interesting in this book, and I really wanted to know more about why he did what he did, and how he felt about it. Where were his loyalties, really? Great book that you can read out of order, but honestly it's nice to have read the ones before it, especially the one directly before, which was written from Moran's perspective. "
"And Tana French has done it again! I'm so relieved that this book was as entertaining and engrossing as her earlier books (such as The Likeness) and has steered away from the magical realism that ""solved"" the last couple of these mysteries. I loved the mystery here and it (mostly) kept me guessing with the fast-paced storytelling and entertaining characters. I was going to be disappointed if another one of these mysteries was resolved by the supernatural and this did not disappoint. I was glad this one started Conway with a healthy dose of Stephen Moran and Breslin. I liked Conway as the main - liked the perspective she built - and was definitely fascinated by the mystery. A lot happened in a few days. Definitely liked this one better than the teen gossip-y one but now I'm curious about how Conway was in that one! Like the world of Murder Detectives and how she separates it out from Missing Persons (where you're hoping for a happy ending). Will definitely read anything else Tana French decides to write! "
"This title “The Trespasser” literally left me breathless at the end. I could not put it down. I had read all of Tana French’s previous novels but she it the jackpot with this one. And I cannot even tell you why because you would not read it at once. It is brilliantly conceived,, written and complete. The twists and turns are remarkable and all I ca say is borrow it, buy it, listen to it and whatever you do - do not miss it. Her ear for Dublin slang is bone deep and I can only suggest you google the words that don’t make sense until you realize their rhythm and the depth it brings to this book. I hope you will, as I did, read it and hear it in your head with a Dubliner’s voice. This is not British slang but cop talk from the heart of Dublin. And print out a street map of Dublin to have a sense of the locale. She has written a brilliant novel/mystery/thriller that must not be missed. That’s all you need to know. The rest will become evident as your turn the pages. It is simply superb."
"I have read all of Tana French's books and this one did not disappoint. Once again we are back with the Dublin Murder squad and characters from the previous book but they are in a different place in their career and lives. Each book is loosely linked to previous but the characters are often in different circumstances. In the last book Stephen Moran was working cold cases and wanted to get on the murder squad- in this one he is in the squad and is partnered with Antoinette Conway (who was a seasoned murder detective in the last book but this time appears less experienced than Moran).

The most enjoyable part of a Tana French book is the way she weaves her characters- it hooks you in and keeps you not wanting to put the book down. In this book Conway and Moran are assigned a case that one of their colleagues is involved in (they don't know this at first). The author also includes aspect of the work environment in the murder squad that makes the book more authentic and gives the reader a greater investment in the characters. A great read."
"I waited forever for this book. I've been following Tana French since we were In The Woods in 2007. Drawn in by the way she enlivened the characters, painted the Irish scene, I anxiously awaited the next book in this Dublin Murder Squad series every time. The Trespasser is #6, my lucky number. But this installment left me feeling shorted.

One of the reasons I follow this series so closely is because of the unique people and environments that seem to come alive as the story unfolds; a peek into their culture. Unfortunately, this novel seemed lacking in this. There wasn't a place to get attached to; it seemed more about words, about conversations. This meant that the characters had to really hold the story. They pulled their weight, but the complete picture was still missing for me.

A solid detective novel and still one of my top picks for 2016; I sincerely enjoyed The Trespasser. If I'd not had the other books in the series to compare it to, I wouldn't have had anything negative to say about it."
"I loved this book so much. I adore every Tana French book I read, and think they are getting better every time. But this one was truly something special. The characters are so complete, so nuanced and layered and believable, I know I'm going to miss them terribly for weeks. I listened to the audio book and the narrator is absolutely phenomenal. Antoinnette is such a beautifully rendered character. 
The scene where she is clocking the intruder outside her house and mentally inventorying all of the people in her life and who she can call for backup, has stuck with me for days. The pacing was taut, driving the story relentlessly forward and I couldn't wait to get back to it. The writing was gorgeous and so insightful.

What absolutely terrified me about this story was the depiction of how dishonest cops (especially those ""protecting their own"" could fabricate a case and frame an innocent person both convincingly and unconscionably. The interrogation scenes had me sweating bullets!

Everything about this book felt right. I cannot wait for the next one."
"This is the first time I have read anything written by Tana French. I kept hearing from many people how great this series was so when The Trespasser came up as a BOMC selection for November, I grabbed it! Everyone told me that although this is book six in the series you don’t have to read them in order and they were correct. Each book centers on a different detective in the Dublin Murder Squad so it is not necessary to go in order.
I am so glad I listened to all the recommendations because this is a great book! There are a lot of twists and turns, so you never truly get ahold of anything to make a good guess at who-dunit! Things kept popping up to make me rethink things just when I thought I might have the mystery figured out the next chapter would blow that theory away. I cannot wait to go back and read the other books in this great series. If you enjoy a good thriller or police prodecural with great characters-read this!

"The Trespasser is my first Tana French novel. It was a Christmas gift from my daughter. Thank you Jen for knowing exactly what I look for in a novel. Murder mysteries featuring strong women are among my favorites.

Our story takes place in Dublin. Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are investigating what looks like a date gone wrong. All evidence is pointing to the victim’s new boyfriend. Arresting and charging him with murder would make the case an easy solve. Too easy as far as Antoinette and Steve are concerned. And so their investigation begins . . .

Thank you Tana French for this fast paced, page turner of a novel. As soon as I thought that I had it all figured out, the tables would turn and I was back to square one with no hint of whodunnit. You kept me on the edge of my seat right up to the very end. I’m happy to give you five stars and I will be checking out your other novels as well.

"I think I've read all of Ms French's books. This is the best yet. It's thick with wonderful language, elegant descriptions of settings, intricate plots, complicated characters, spot on dialogue. A police procedural and an interesting psychological study. The female protagonist is strong and gritty and multi-layered. I hope there will be more stories about her and her partner and the Dublin-based Murder Squad. (Maybe a movie?!)"
The book was a long and winding journey but worth it. You felt like a detective right along with the characters-trying to decipher the truth.
French does it again. A mystery that turns again and again. Very satisfying.
"Accents are something my imagination has never been good at recreating and with this novel set in Dublin getting a narrator that captures these well really sets the scene and world of these detectives. Antoinette is the type of character that on the surface is all sharp edges and in another narrator's hands could easily come off as a bitchy ""no one can mess with me"" robocop but Hlida Fay brings out her humanness is just the right way to balance the character. The other detectives have their own flavor and her range of character voices is impressive and comes off naturally.  Tana French creates great characters and I enjoy their dialogue quite a bit. Antoinette is more like a wounded abused animal that goes into situations expecting cruelty over friendship and has an tendancy to paranoia. Her partner Murray is a great foil for her- calm, likeable and a bit of a dreamer. There's a slimy reporter, Rico Suave senior detective and the victim Aislinn who starts off as a superficial barbie doll but develops real depth as the novel progresses. Ending was satisfying and well done."
"Each book follows a detective pair from the Dublin Police Force as they solve a crime. Each book can be read as a stand-alone…. but why would you do that when you have 6 perfect books in a series?!

My review:
I’m reviewing all 6 of these books together because while they all have different plots and story lines there is nothing I would say differently about each one. They are all phenomenal! In my opinion, Tana French has written the best detective driven thriller/mystery books I’ve ever read.

Each book is written in a way that really draws you in. Each storyline, either in the past or present, hooks you. I stayed up late reading them all because I could not put them down.

Most times when I’m reading a thriller, the whole time in the front of my mind I’m trying to figure out who did it. Who’s the killer? But with these books that part was really pushed to the back of my mind. Of course I wanted to know and to solve the mystery, but I really cared so much more about the story. Read this series!! You won’t be disappointed!"
"The Trespasser By Tana French is a general fiction read.
Antoinette Conway, the tough, abrasive detective from The Secret Place, is still on the Murder squad, but only just. She's partnered up with Stephen Moran now, and that's going well - but the rest of her working life isn't. Antoinette doesn't play well with others, and there's a vicious running campaign in the squad to get rid of her. She and Stephen pull a case that at first looks like a slam-dunk lovers' tiff, but gradually they realise there's more going on: someone on their own squad is trying to push them towards the obvious solution, away from nagging questions. They have to work out whether this is just an escalation in the drive to get rid of her - or whether there's something deeper and darker going on.
This was an OK read. Bit slow and didn’t connect with the characters. Then bam I cannot put it down. I have to know who it is. Am I right with who I think it is? Highly recommended. 5*. Thanks to netgalley for the arc."

Except when Antoinette takes a good look at the victim's face, she realises she's seen her somewhere before. And suddenly the conviction that there's a different answer takes her breath away.
They do not come much better - Tana French never fails to impress - bring on her next book asap."
"The Dublin Murder Squad series is a must-read for anyone who enjoys deeply psychological police procedurals and excellent characterization.
The Trespasser is the sixth book in the series but stands alone. It's narrated by Detective Antoinette Conway, the lone female on the Squad. She and her partner Stephen Moran are charged with solving the murder of a perfectly dressed and made-up young woman who was obviously waiting for a special date to arrive.
Conway's chip-on-the-shoulder attitude and her complicated relationship with Moran and the other detectives is what sets this novel apart. She is tough, witty, and sarcastic, and Tana French's colorful Irish dialogue is sheer perfection. As the investigation proceeded, I felt haunted by the victim and wanted desperately for her killer to be found, yet I was startled and outraged by the revelation.
I listened to this book on audio and Hilda Fay's authentic Irish accent and powerful narration were outstanding.
"
"If you need to escape into another world where the air is crisp and the attitude smart, look no further. There is a reason that Tana French is lauded on both sides of the Atlantic: she's really good. This page-turning story about a murder is more about the detective than the vic, but office politics are only part of it. French pulled me in before the first paragraph was over with such a rich sense of scene, a funny and articulate bad-ass attitude that reflects the character's weakness/need with every step of her outrageously strong desire line... Even her slang was easy to understand in context and had me smiling every time. For writers, it is also incredible to see how so many perspectives about this crime are really variations that make completely different stories. French turns on a dime to tell each one, leaving the reader to only marvel at her skill...and keep reading long past bedtime."
"Totally brilliant!

This book had me on the edge of my seat for the entire length. I stayed up much too late/early finishing it this morning. Wow!

The author had me. She had me liking characters and disliking those same characters. I hated some and then felt sorry for them. I was convinced of guilt and then sure of innocence. Doubt and certainty! What a fabulous writer.

Aside from the characters being superbly written, the locations are also brilliantly described. I can see Dublin Castle and its squad room, incident room, and interview room. I can see the flat and the walled garden behind it. French is awesome at this. Dublin is a separate character in this series.

The narration of this entire series has been fantastic. This one is no exception. I truly didn't want it to end.

I discovered this series after all the books had been written so I haven't had to wait for the next one. Until now. And it's going to be a terrible wait."
"Another stunning Dublin Murder Squad procedural from Tana French, highlighting the power -- for good or ill -- of the stories that we inhabit and that inhabit us:

""Then I sit there, running the heat to try and thaw my feet after Lucy's flat, and watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person's skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed of that mind too. Even the cute little student mincing along in her flowery dress, the shuffling old fella with his shuffling spaniel, they look Ebola-lethal."""
"Painfully slow to start, but WOW - what a finish!"
Gripping writing with twists and turns to the very end. Excellent mystery.
this one didn't disappoint.
"This book made my head hurt, but in a good way.

The plot goes a mile a minute, twisting and turning, and blows itself up about every chapter once you get into the last third of the book. Every time I thought I had something figured out, the whole thing would shake itself apart and then rebuild into an entirely different shape. The real explanation, in the end, was both far simpler and far more complicated than any of the theories they’d come up with prior to that.

Also, I loved Steve and Antoinette, and how they interacted. Their relationship, and how it evolved and changed, mostly due to how Antoinette’s understanding of herself changed, was a lot of fun to watch. These were great characters, and all of them were so real I felt like I could reach out and touch them (though some, I wouldn’t want to).

Tana French always brings her A game, and this was her A++ game. I love her Dublin Murder Squad books, and I try to never miss an opportunity to pick one up."
"I think this might just be my favorite of the series—saving the best for last. I believed it all, even when I was not at all on board with what the characters were doing/thinking. I did not guess the outcome. I was not annoyed by red herrings. I loved the overall issues concerning trust and loyalty. French's characters have real problems and real concerns and those issues do not begin on page one and wrap up neatly at the end of the book. The book resolves but also carries on in my head.

No spoilers, but the dig at Barbie on page 57 made me smile and reread. The dig at Trump much later was good too. It's not a political mystery, but I appreciate that these characters live in the real world.

I could barely put it down, well over 400 pages and I finished it in 48 hours. The story was real enough in my head that I could have been watching it as a movie or even living the story. Yeah, that good, for me at least."
"I'm a big fan of Tana French and got a chance to read a ARC of The Trespasser. I don't want to give anything away but I will say I have read all of her other books and although this one was not my favorite it is near the top. All of her books have a psychological element to them and this one is no different, it may not be as in your face as with past books like Broken Harbor but it is there and adds greatly to the story and to the inner workings of the murder squad and Conway as a person and people in general for that matter. This book left me not being able to wait until the next book in the Dublin Murder Squad series (which I know is ironic because this one isn't even out yet). Tana French is one of the best newer writers I have come across and her books always leave me completely satisfied and this one was no different, I would recommend it to any and all readers. "
"The latest title in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, ""The Trespasser"" features tough-as-nails Detective Antoinette Conway, last seen in ""The Secret Place"". As the only woman on the squad, Conway faces hazing from her fellow detectives, and her refusal to become ""one of the boys"" is only making things harder for her. She and partner Stephen Moran are tossed what initially seems to be a boring cut-and-dried domestic case, but as they investigate they discover hints of possible mob involvement and police corruption. Will digging too deep bring them into further conflict with their colleagues and superiors?

Like all of Tana French’s novels, ""The Trespasser"" offers great character sketches and dialogue together with evocative, sharply witty description. You won’t want to skip a single page, even though the tense story line will keep you anxious to know what happens next."
"Tana French is a wonderful writer and this is the best of all her great books. It's been a long wait since the last one, but worth it. I couldn't put the book down - except when I had no choice. The characters pull you into the story and through every twist and turn of their world. In a departure from earlier books, the female detective has to handle not only a dangerous murder investigation but abuse from the male-dominated Murder Squad - which she does in her own gritty and unique way. I continued to think about the characters after I finished the book. I especially loved this line near the end, when Antoinette has finally figured out what's going on with the murder and the Murder Squad: ""The cobblestones have lost that misty feel, they're centuries worth of solid again.""

Now I'd love to see a movie based on The Trespasser."
"Another excellent book by Tana French, one of my favorite crime thriller writers.

Set within the Dublin Murder Squad, Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran cop a case that seems like a by the books lover's quarrel gone bad. However as the investigation and clues link up, the murder may not be as clear cut as originally thought.

Add to that the fact that the Detectives in Murder Squad are making her life miserable because they don't fancy a woman on the team and seem be hindering all her attempts at getting to the root of the investigation.

Antoinette & her partner continue to sift through clues to find the murderer of Ainslinn Murray and they discover along the way that deep dark secrets have a way of rising to the top in any investigation.

Great writing. Kept me guessing and double guessing along the way."
"The only reason it took a month to read this book was that I was traveling while reading and then a library reserve popped up. As with all of her other books, Tana French knocks it out of the park. The mystery is engaging but her characters are, as always, the best part of her writing. I'm still amazed at how French can write in the first person with such a different voice from book to book. She develops her characters well without having long paragraphs of needless exposition (I hate, hate, hate long descriptive paragraphs). I didn't love ""The Secret Place"" but that was mostly because I just did not like the main character (he was better in this story since he was outside the main narration).

The only issue I have reading her books is that I spend an unnecessary amount of time trying to figure out what secondary or tertiary character will be the primary in the next book!"
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad novels. In this story, a woman is found dead in her living room. At first glance, it seems an easily solved domestic case; however, when Detective Conway and Detective Moran look further into the case, they discover that there is more than meets the surface. Perhaps a gang related crime. Perhaps, even, the police are involved to some extent. In the midst of this, there is also an exploration of gender relations, as Detective Conway is the only female on the murder squad and faces constant hazing as the result of it. It's difficult to discuss the plot of the book without giving away spoilers, but I loved the unraveling of this crime from beginning to end.

As always, I loved the way Tana French fleshes out and creates such complex characters. I'm always wholly involved in their stories and hate to see them leave when the book ends."
"An exceptional work of twists, turns, deceptions, fantasies, paranoia, insightful detective work, and follow-your-gut stick-to-itiveness. Her characters are so multi-layered, so dynamic, so complex, and real-to-life. This is by far, the best of Tana French's work thus far."
Another perfect novel by Tana French.
"Bravo! This was my first time reading Tana French, so I was optimistic about the outcome. I enjoy books set in Ireland, and they can be rare. This book entices you into the narrative with rich characters and a strong sense of place. As I entertain overly positive thoughts about all-things-Irish, I was pleasantly disabused of these notions by the author...the Garda is as conflicted by pettiness as are organizations everywhere, and those who are not part of the mainstream are at risk of being destroyed. The strong female character was inspiring, as well as the author's ability to bring doubt Into the reader's mind about who the detective's real allies were...good job.

The mystery itself was cleverly cast, and kept one guessing for quite some time, and the denouement with the chief was especially well done.

I will be reading more by this author, and am looking forward to it."
"Tana French blows me away. I've read all of her books and each one features mind-boggling metaphors and in-depth character development. I feel like I know the detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad intimately. This book was no exception. Most of her books feature a male protagonist, so it was refreshing to read from a female protagonist's point-of-view this time. You'll either love or hate the main character - Detective Antoinette Conway - for her fierceness, sharp tongue and rebellious personality. Personally, I loved her. Despite your opinion on Antoinette Conway, one things for certain: you won't be able to put this book down! In my opinion, Tana French is hands-down the BEST in crime fiction."
"Tana French has yet to disappoint me. I once again lost sleep devouring every word and being led down the merry path. Tana French perfectly sets the alienated, paranoid atmosphere of the lead character, Antoinette, so that it permeates and seeps into the readers psyche causing shadows of doubt to appear on one's own reasoning ability to follow the who-done-it clues. So many authors know how to spin a yarn but come to a crash and burn with their endings. Tana knows how to wrap each last word so that one is left thankful for artistry but saddened that it has come to an end. I already eagerly await the arrival of Tana's next book. In the meantime I shall kill time perusing many a book shelves looking for her equal. "
"What a great read. I absolutely loved this book and it definitely lived up to my expectations.

The strength of this novel lies in its wonderful character studies - both of the main character and narrator, Detective Conway, and the victim, Aishlinn. The narrators voice is authentic and so well written; the issues she is encountering colour her perspective and create a lovely tension for the reader in terms of how reliable she is as a narrator. The exploration of the victims character and its development is really skilfully done too.

I've read all of Tana Frenchs books and enjoyed them; I think this has to rate up there among my favourites. It's solidly plotted, beautifully written and a fabulous exploration of character.


"
"Ah Tana French! You just melt into her books, emerging 100s of pages later with a bemused expression on your face. As usual, her command of voice, character development and attention to detail -- I love the part about the Oreos in the interview room --are excellent. What makes this one exceptional, though, is the plotting. In some of her books, the plots just kind of disintegrate. I don't really care because the writing is so good, but sometimes I totally lose the thread of who did what to who. This one, though, is a true nail-biter. The sense of suspense is so pervasive that it lingers after one finishes reading. Even now that the book is finished, I feel myself looking over my shoulder a little more often than normal."
"Loved this book! Tana French twists a compelling plot. I adore the way the protagonist changes from book to book but the setting is still the Dublin Murder Squad. Tana French does what no other author does, she switches up the protagonists, leaves some of the supporting characters from earlier books and makes you want to know each detective in the Murder Squad. I find myself hoping that a certain character will evolve from background to protagonist in the next Tana French installment. The Dublin Murder Squad is my all time favorite detective series. Anyone new to Tana French is encouraged to read her earlier books, in order of course, so you can truly appreciate the depth of the characters. Guaranteed you will be a fan. "
"I just finished Tana French’s latest book, THE TRESPASSER (Dublin Murder Squad, 6). I am totally spent; exhausted.
Murder Squad Detectives - Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran - are main characters in this title, with Detective Conway doing the narration.
The story is full of mystery, suspense and raw emotion. The ripple effects of the murder find their way everywhere and are not forgiving.
The complex characters, the locale and ‘sense of place’, the ‘cut it with a knife’ atmosphere in the Murder Squad Room, the relationships between detectives, the relationships among families and friends, the weaving together of fantasy and reality, the beautiful writing - all blend together into an intriguing, suspenseful, spectacular, emotional read.
"
"This is my first Tana French novel and I can't wait to read another. At first I was skeptical because it is such a long book for a mystery at some 450 pages. But I can't imagine where she could have cut anything, it was quite compelling and I didn't skip a word. As for being a mystery novel, that doesn't come close to pegging it -- it works on several levels and I saw it described as a literary mystery, which fits well. I also like the fact that although it's part of a series, there's a different detective for each book. Too often a series seems to get bogged down when it's just the same thing over and over. Introducing new major characters keeps things lively. This was sixth in a series and I didn't feel lost for not having read any of the previous novels yet. Great book."
"again, outstanding! another Tana French tour de force. this one is way darker than the other two novels in this series that i've read — The Secret Place and The Likeness. lots of misdirection and dead ends and it also has a more profound psychological bent to it than the others i've read. and to repeat what i said in an earlier review; Ms French's novels are more about the detectives than either the victim, or the possible perpetrators. "
"The sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series, this is the second book I've read. The other book wasThe Secret Place, and it is where Conway and Moran are first paired up to solve a cold case. Now established partners, Conway and Moran are at the bottom rung of the Murder squad, getting the worst shifts and the worst cases. When they are assigned to yet-another-domestic murder, Conway is resigned to see it through but Moran sees potentially bigger picture and a much bigger case. The weary, tired Conway is a stark contrast to the eager, hopeful Moran. While the plot is interesting and moves quickly, it's the characters and their relationships that truly bring this book to life. One of my favorite reads of 2016."
"I am such a fan of French's that I hang on to every word she writes. Nothing is left to chance. Motives are subtle, characters often are raw and ugly, and the action can be prolonged when the situation warrants or shockingly sudden. Characters come with flaws making the reader hate Antoinette's actions but then fear for her brutal treatment at the hands of her superiors. Her writing is detailed so don't expect a quick read. Details vividly lead the reader directly into the dirty crime scene and into the heads of the detectives. I know that when I pick up one of French's mysteries, I am in for an absorbing world of deception and detailed character motivation. Nothing is as it seems. This is Irish crime at its nastiest. "
"Honestly, I was worried about this one, because sometimes I'm cautious about white people writing protagonists of color. (I'm all for diversity in books, obviously, but I'd rather highlight writers of color than white writers who write people of color.) But I was pleasantly surprised--Conway's race comes up a few times, but French stays in her lane when writing about it, and never said anything that took me out of the story. There's a lot about how being a woman in law enforcement is difficult, and then even more difficult when you're a woman of color, and everything French wrote was accurate.

I'm not sure if this was my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book, but I definitely enjoyed it and couldn't put it down."
"I'm a big fan of Tana French and this latest mystery contains all the elements that I admire about her work. There are flawed but sympathetic characters who make understandable if regrettable choices. There's wonderfully entertaining dialogue and great descriptions of Dublin and police procedures. She really has a marvelous way of putting the reader right in the center of the action and getting them invested in the outcome. This book presents a wonderfully twisting mystery along with aspects of racism/sexism in the police force that are subtle enough to be entirely realistic. No mustache-twirling villains or white-hatted heroes. Marvelously entertaining, and among the best of the series."
"Irish writer, Tana French, is one of my favorite crime writers. She combines crime fiction with literary fiction. And each book she writes has an original story line. Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are the newbies on the murder squad. Antoinette has suffered great harassment from the male detectives, who don’t appreciate an intelligent female being brought on board. She and Steven end up with the late shift and end up with what looks like a murder that should be a quick closed case of domestic violence. But the pieces aren’t fitting as well as they should, and their investigation turns into a much more sinister investigation. "
"Another winner for this series. Again, the police procedural/mystery and plotting are terrific, the characters full and interesting, the writing just right for the material, and the human insights memorable. This is what Tana French does best. "
"Even though Antoinette is not the easier protagonist to follow, her voice is so real and TF does it again... a great read; I was completely hooked. And that's all I'm going to write because it's a murder mystery after all!"
"In case you're new to her, this is the sixth book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Each book is a standalone and, interestingly, each one has a different narrator and/or protagonist so that a secondary character in one novel becomes the lead in the next. On one level these are top -notch police procedurals, but she's equally or more interested in the tensions and rivalries between the detectives themselves. These go beyond the standard ""maverick versus the machine"" shtick we find in so much crime fiction -each detective's back story is gradually revealed so that the story becomes as much about understanding their motivations as the identity of the killer. I've loved them all and this is one of the best."
"Reread twice, and I even stayed up an entire night rereading it even though I knew exactly what was gonna happen… really one of my favourite Tana French novels :-) I love Antoinette Conway!! Love her. One of, if not the biggest standout among her characters, with such a distinct personal voice that I really enjoy. I loved the plotline, that big twist was one I would never have expected, and more importantly it was so well-written that I truly felt her descent into paranoia, suspicion and self-doubt. And although the same worries and doubts are constantly brought up throughout the book, it never feels repetitive, which is often a problem I face with other authors, but never with French. Certainly will not be my last reread :-) "
"This is now my favorite French, and I can't believe I almost missed it! I loved the lead detective, her take-no-shit attitude, and the camaraderie she had with her partner. The way French depicted being a female detective in a predominately male environment felt so realistic to me, and I couldn't get over the sense of paranoia within the squad and how it all played out. You understand where the heroine is coming from, but you also see how it alienates her further from the people who are supposed to be her teammates. This mystery was gripping, and listening on audio added to my obsession. It can be read as a standalone, but I recommend reading The Secret Place first to see the heroine from another perspective. I'm So Obsessed With It. "
"I absolutely love this series and hope there will be more. Each book has completely different ways of character language, plot development and pace. But each one has been compelling. "
"Read this as an egalley through Netgalley. French just gets better with each new entry in the Dublin Murder Squad. This time it is newly promoted Antoinette Conway who partners with Steve Moran. The gender bias against her as the only woman on the squad is repulsive. The case the two are assigned is a domestic abuse that results in murder. The immediate suspect is the boyfriend, knowing that in a French book that will be questioned in the reader's mind. How many twists can the investigation take? How much can Antoinette waver from her convictions? Great good fun and food for thought as always. "
"A brilliantly written page turner, captivating and enthralling…Detective Antoinette Conway is tough and bitter. She is worried about her job, has a huge chip on her shoulder and is convinced she is being harassed and persecuted by fellow officers. A beautiful woman’s death seems to be a straight forward domestic but Conway doesn’t believe it is. Soon Conway and her young partner/ protégée are forced to team up with a seasoned cop whom she doesn’t trust. Layer by layer, French takes us into the politics of a murder squad, the annals of police procedurals, questioning witnesses, finding evidence, building a case. A must read…"
"I won this book as a free giveaway, which was very welcome, because it's one I think I actually would have paid money for. I've read all of Tana French's Dublim Murder Squad books, and while I have enjoyed them all, I think this is definitely one of the better ones. A couple of them have been a little bit ridiculous (e.g. The Likeness), and this one occasionally veered that way, but still believable. I don't want to say too much more because this is one of those books it's better to go into blind so as to not ruin the mystery."
"This book was testing my patience at first, to the point where I was like ""what the fuck, Tana French?"" But I stuck with it. There's a very strong theme of 'the stories people make up for themselves' (with a side helping of 'toxic masculinity is fragile and terrifying all at once.') The plots and subplots crash together in a truly amazing way in the last few climactic confrontations.

Also I seriously love reading the way French writes interrogations. In basically every book in this series you get to witness various characters' psyches being eviscerated down to the atomic level, practically. There's something sort of horrible and amazing about it."
"When a Tana French book comes out, all others must fall in line behind. I didn't think she could deliver after the spectacular Secret Place novel. But Tana French fools me every time. Each book that comes out is better than the previous. The character development, the plot line, the twists and turns she sends us on in each journey are always better than the last.

I've said before with this author, I can't wait for the next book. She's definitely got a way with words.

I've also said before that I don't rehash the book jacket info. Read the flap, then read the book. You won't be disappointed."
"What an outstanding murder mystery! I loved the dialect this book was written in, kept the book very raw and believable. I found myself really disliking the main character Antoinette for most of the novel, which worked brilliantly. In fact, most of the characters were truly hard to out and out like, and many I just hated, but again this added to my enjoyment of the book. This was truly a murder mystery of extremes. I had to keep madly reading, because every time I thought the detectives had figured out a clue, I was let down. And even when some clarity came about, there was even more twists. Do not miss this fantastic book. You will not be disappointed. "
"Tana French didn't disappoint. Best police procedural writer I know. Antoinette Conway is a new lead detective on the Dublin Murder Squad. She and her partner are assigned a murder case that at first looks like a slam dunk domestic. But then, the plot thickens. Reading this, I felt like I was in the squad room, and along for every plot twist. Issues of identity, misogyny, and manipulation keep the story substantial. The story kept me hooked and the writing didn't miss a beat. Recommend to mystery buffs who don't want to roll their eyes at the writing, fans of female detectives and fans of the rougher side of Dublin."
"French writes so evocatively, and creates various layers to her characters and her settings that you cannot help but get (happily) lost in the story. Reading her books feels like brain fuel and brain candy all at once, which is the rarest treat and I absolutely love it. I did have the killer figured out about 75% of the way through (first time ever for one of her books), but it was after the full picture was being sketched out anyway and the detectives just had guessed/assumed wrong about some key elements. 5 stars--please hurry up a write another one, Tana, I need some escapism now more than ever."
"Tana French just keeps on getting better and better. I know Conway would be awesome having a book revolved around her; I'm glad she lived up to my expectations.

This was actually the most depressing story by far, mostly because of the BS that Conway and Moran are dealing with from their own squad. The sexism and misogyny in the workplace totally hit close to home.

The way this story unfolded was just downright genius. Maybe some readers would be bored by the talking and would want some more action but me- I love two people talking in a room. It's claustrophobic, tense, and real.

Oh please let next book be about Fleas."
"Tana French (The Secret Place; Broken Harbour; Faithful Place; The Likeness; In the Woods) has created another beautifully written suspense novel. The dialogue is gripping, and readers will obsessively (not unlike some of this novel's characters) tear through the pages of this one. French offers diversions, and she keeps her readers guessing (about multiple plot lines) until the very end. Tana French's devoted fans will view this as a worthy installment to the series, and those new to the Dublin Murder Squad will appreciate this as an introduction.

"The Trespasser is a contemporary detective story by an Irish author with a female protagonist. Her series takes place in Ireland, and the language is full of Irish slang which was not edited out for us Americans. Yay! Much of the story takes place inside Antoinette's head - second guessing herself, feeling disliked and manipulated. This is the third book I have read by Tana French, and the plot and psychological angst is fresh and authentic. Just for fun, The Secret Place was written from her partner's point of view. I definitely need to go back and catch the books I've missed. Smartly written, highly recommended. "
Am I the only one hoping for a book with Fleas as the narrator?
"I love Tana French books. I've read them all. What I love about them is that they are more than just a crime novels. There is always more to the story than catching the killer. I love that. This one is the one that is closest to the traditional crime story. It's a hunt for the killer. But again, it's so much more. It's about stories/fantasies/truths we tell our selves and other people. It makes you wonder what is real and what is the made up/alteret versjon to fit our own beliefs and wishes. And does it really matters? If we believe it strong enough, then it must be true, right?

I hope I get to read more about Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran. They are a great team."
"I love the Tana French books and always know they will be great! However, when I first started this one, I was a little put off by Detective Conway crabbing about her bad relationships with the other detectives on her squad. I wanted to get into the mystery and not hear about drama. I wanted her to be a stronger woman and get past all that side crap. However, Tana French knows just how to draw us completely into the story and then I was hooked. I really loved the relationship Conway has with her partner, Steve, and their dialog. The suspense kept me very interested and I suggest this book for all mystery/suspense readers and others that want to give this genre a try!"
"If you love procedural police dramas, this book is for you. I've been obsessed with crime novels lately and this was a perfect solution to my cravings!"
"I took a sick day yesterday and needed a good solid read to distract me from both my head cold and the larger political circus. This fit the bill nicely, but also fulfills the requirements of literature. It made me think about the stories we tell ourselves, and shook me out of a funk on a narrative I'd been wallowing in.

And I found the most apt quote to explain the political system, the climate change deniers, etc. It is in reference to the question of someone's innocence and two kinds of belief.

""You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts taht contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that."""
"Having only ever read the first Tana French book which I recall thinking didn't quite live up to the hype I've not followed this series and The Trespasser is book 6. It was an excellent study in team dynamics and loyalty wrapped around the murder of a young woman with a back story. Written from the perspective of the only woman on the Dublin Murder Squad her attitude and sense of being a victim herself offers a powerful perspective on the events that unfold. Many twists and you are left guessing right until the final page as to whether justice will be done or not.

I guess I will now need to go back and read books 2-5!"
"I think this is TF's best yet! I like her female D's best! And although I don't really mind when she leaves loose ends, I liked it that this time everything got pretty neatly tied up at the end. Also, it was a nice change of pace to not have a piece of real estate figure as a central character/plot device. As usual, not only did I gobble the book down in less than three days (and ignore work in the process). there were passages so well-written and psychologically acute that I actually copied them into a notebook for future inspiration in my own writing. Hope her next one comes out soon!

"
"Not as strong as the best in the series, and surprisingly - maybe since it’s the closer? - indulges the neatly tied ends and the characters we care about learn the lessons they’re meant to in a way she rarely does, so it’s both more and less satisfying than her most haunting stories. But an engaging read with interesting personalities, if not as deeply real as others she’s drawn, and most of all an examination of the idea of story, the ones we tell others and ourselves. The power of story isn’t limited to alibis and motives of course, and as usual French hangs a message on the mystery that sneaks through the kaleidoscoping plot. "
"I love how Tana French so easily twists the reader, convinces them to see and think exactly what she wants to. Even on the sixth book, when I should be prepared for it, she manages to surprise me every time with the details that I missed and should have caught on to. While this isn't my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book, the series as a whole is one of my favorite series and this book is still excellent and very well written.

""You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing other than who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that."""
"The Trespasser - Reread Nov 20 - Tana French Recommend 63
I love her books; every one in the series has delivered. Its cleverly effortless reading but really well crafted. I just drink in the story and the characters and the dialogue flow. I read the series in order - the main character in one has been introduced in the novel before. This is the 6th in the Dublin murder squad and focuses on Antoinette Conway . Detailed police procedural; she's trying to solve a murder and deal with flack from her new (male) colleagues - should she take the easy option she feels like she's being pushed into or carry on digging. Thoroughly recommended.
"
"Another fantastic Tana French / Dublin Murder Squad book! I was immediately drawn into the characters -- detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. They are partners on the midnight shift, and have a sixth sense about each other. We follow them as they investigate a murder, all while being pressured by the other detectives on the squad. French has a lovely way of setting a scene and making the reader feel like they are right there with the detectives. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that she will continue to write Dublin Murder Squad books.

Read more of my reviews at https://thegoodreader13.blogspot.com/."
"Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran are outcasts on the Dublin Murder Squad. When they get a routine domestic case to solve, everyone is surprised when they don’t take the evidence at face value. Antoinette recognizes the victim from her previous unit, missing persons and feels something is amiss. She keeps digging until she finds the truth regardless of how senior detectives or her superiors instruct her to move forward.

I’m sad the series is over but it definitely ran it’s course. I enjoyed reading it and love books set in Ireland. Moving on to Tana French’s next series soon"
"I was lucky enough to get an advance copy from NetGalley.

Every new Tana French book is my favorite -- until the next one comes along. I read this one in two sittings, only stopping for a couple of hours of sleep.

I'll leave it to others to describe the plot and only say that this book does a great job in detailing the procedural aspects of a detective's job while also delving deep into the psychology of everyone remotely involved with the murder. As usual, it's hard to tell the good guys (and girls) from the bad guys."
"Tana French has written another excellent murder mystery in The Trespasser.

Beyond that, though, she's written a fantastic description of what a hostile work environment feels like from the inside. Colleagues who want to appear neutral become -- in the victim's head -- part of the conspiracy. Paranoia rules; nothing can be trusted. Detective Antoinette Conway becomes her own worst enemy. She knows it. She can't help it.

The mystery is fantastic. The insight into the mind of the marginalized detective is even better."
"Another excellent book from Tana French.

As per usual, the story focuses on a transformative case in the life of a murder detective. What that winds up meaning is that there is a ton of character development and exploration. The major theme that I picked up on in this book is the idea of how we can get caught up in our own stories and lose sight of reality, twisting trivial or coincidental things to fit our preconceived beliefs and blinding ourselves to the obvious. The writing style is typical of French and absolutely outstanding. Can't recommend her books enough."
"As usual, French spins a good yard. This book was a bit of a departure from the others as there were no giant question marks at the end, and nothing vaguely supernatural. It was a straightforward murder mystery that paralleled Conway’s life in many ways. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good suspense/mystery and fans of Tana French will be pleased with this addition. I can not wait to see where she goes next with the series.

"I like this genre and I like Irish writers, but this book is really good beyond any categories. Tana French is amazing. She tells the story through Antoinette Conway, a murder squad detective who is tough. She has all the right reasons to be tough.
Like the best writers, French drops her insights on her readers in the course of the story. Listen to this:
""You can knock down a genuine belief, if you load up with enough facts that contradict it; but a belief that's built on nothing except who the person wants to be, nothing can crumble that."" That resonates true for me.
"
"I love everything Tana French puts out, and can never put them down once I start. I love that this narrator was female. <> I also really liked that the main character doesn't need to change careers at the end because she's blown things up so badly during the course of the book. I felt like some of her other narrators all ended up walking off to do something else, and when the topic of leaving the D squad was floated, I was kinda disappointed that it would end that way. I was plenty surprised and quite satisfied by the ending. :-)"
"While I've read all of the stories in this series, The Trespasser can be read without perusing the previous five. Ms. French's books portray a dark and dangerous Dublin - they are atmospheric and brilliant. The characters are complicated - and not particularly likeable. That said, the lead character in The Trespasser is a tough woman who reminded me of Helen Mirren's character in Prime Suspect. And the men on her squad can be sexist jerks - again, shades of Prime Suspect that ring true. If you enjoy police procedurals with loads of twists, this is the series for you."
"I liked this more than the last one, which I gave five stars. I read it quickly and enjoyed it. The characters were great, the plot was compelling, the writing was gorgeous. And yet I am disappointed. It was just.... a mystery. There was a murder. It was solved. Nothing weird happened. People made good choices. There was no rising tide of despair, no train headlights you could see coming from page one with no hope of avoidance. For a mystery, it was great. For Tana French, it was...???? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"This series has fallen into a stupendous rhythm. Interesting detective (and sometimes their equally interesting partner) pursues a murder with a twist, ends up going far deeper than they intended, and come out the other side with a tidy conclusion. There are loads of red herrings and false starts that keep you on your toes. If Tana French came out with one of these very year for the rest of my life, I'd be happy.

I wonder who the next book will focus on. Maybe one of the floater cops, especially the one who got in a little trouble."
"Tana French brings us another story of Antoinette Conway and the Dublin Murder Squad, this one involving the death of a beautiful young girl who was apparently killed by her man friend when she was hosting him for a dinner in her home. Except that they they keep coming up with more ""if"" questions that won't neatly fit into the circumstantial facts they think they have. Conway also deals with her perception that the men on the squad are against her, looking for any way to make her job more difficult. Sometimes our perceptions aren't as accurate as we would like to think."
"Tana French at her best. I love how often her characters are both maddening and engaging, and that was never more true than here with Antoinette Conway. I am always intrigued by the language of her characters, offering a peek into different cultures and experiences. Overall, the writing in Tana French books is always beautiful, making it a pleasure to read as one moves along with the twists and turns of the mysteries, moving toward resolution. She is truly one of my very favorite crime fiction authors."
"This was just as good as every other one of Tana French's books. I love them. I love her. I will read every word she writes.

This was a very straightforward mystery - no occultish possibly-magick stuff going on. In fact, when it came to a close I found myself finding it quite obvious. French had neatly stacked clues along the way. Really, in anyone else's hands, the story could have been downright boring.

But this is Tana French. She can make the phone book sound amazing. I hung onto her every word.

"
"Tana French is one of my all-time favorite suspense/mystery authors. I am besotted with her Dublin Murder Squad. She is very good at getting to the heart of a character's personality and thoughts to make them seem like real people.

Every time I see she has a new novel coming out, I know I'm going to love it. I need to go back and re-read the earlier books because at this point, I've forgotten what has happened to the other detectives, and knowing that I can live in her worlds again makes me giddy with joy."
"Excellent, like all of her novels. Conway might be my favorite of French's narrators in terms of who I'm just rooting for the most, but I liked several of the other novels better. Conway is so grounded in reality that you lose all element of the mystical that is in some of French's other novels. I still loved it though, and it did, like all of French's novels, suck me in entirely. She writes so well that it feels like there's a beat going through the whole book that speeds up and slows down a different parts of the book but keeps you hooked into it the whole time."
"Damn, I have missed your excellent writing Ms French!
Once again you hit all the right spots with your attention to detail, character building and events within events, with all its wonderfully raw yet intricate twists and turns....I knew the sight of your name on a book made me happy


I highly recommend all French's books, her ability to make you connect with her characters in such a way that you are mentally high fiving them as you read the last page! More please...and quick!"
"First and foremost, I love Tana French's writing. I loved her first four books, but was not crazy about her fifth, ""The Secret Place."" This one was more like her first, ""In the Woods,"" because the plot centered around a murder investigation and took place over just a few days. The action was centered on the detective work and had a wonderful twist with a very satisfying ending. The characters were well-developed, flawed and realistic, and the story kept me up until late at night trying to find out who the murderer was."
"Tana French can do no wrong. Each of her books blows me away and yet they're all so different from one another. I guessed the solution to this mystery fairly early, but it didn't matter. Like French's other books, The Trespasser is so rich, and there's so much to enjoy beyond trying to solve the mystery. I loved the sense of paranoia that permeates the book; I loved Antoinette and Stephen as partners. The last few scenes of this book were so good that I was dumbfounded.

Can't wait to see who the next narrator is."
"There aren't too many authors that are must reads for me, but Tana French is one of them. French is a master of character development. This mystery was well done with lots of twists and turns which is enjoyable, but it's the writing that keeps me coming back. The protagonist is someone I really couldn't identify with personally, but watching her character change over time was a pleasure. I'm putting her earlier work on my reread list. Once you're immersed in the Dublin Murder Squad, it makes Ireland had to leave."
"Few crime fiction writers can transcend the genre with literature-quality prose and complex, interesting characters. Tana French is one of them. While I didn't care as much for her ""In the Woods"", ""The Likeness"" was better, and ""The Trespasseer"" (listened to in audio book format) was brilliant -- fascinating from start to finish. I was worried at first about the length of this book, but eventually realized that no line was wasted and all of it was necessary and enjoyable. The narrator, Hilda Fay, was also amazing. Now I must get the other three I missed in between. "
"My favorite Tana French so far, and that's saying something. Reminded me must a bit of Under the Harrow because once again we are seeing a mystery unfold through the not entirely objective eyes of the narrator, but through the haze of her preconceptions, biases and past experience. Yet surely this is much more real that seeing a mystery through the all-seeing, wise view of a Dalgliesh or other larger-than-life detective. I really, really enjoyed every word. "
"This book once again proves why Tana French is firmly embedded on my favorite authors list. It doesn't get much better than this! A cleverly plotted mystery, brilliant characterisations, fast-paced dialogue and a sprinkling of humour, it's got it all. This is possibly THE best fictional police procedural I have ever read, and the interrogation scenes are simply brilliant. I loved Antoinette Conway as main protagonist, and her change of attitude as the investigation proceeds. One of the highlights of the year, cannot recommend highly enough."
"I am a fan of Tana French and the Dublin Murder squad series. I think readers either love these books or hate them. The cases studied are often conducted by different detectives and their complicated histories are as much a part of the story as are the murders.
The lead investigators in The Trespasser are Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran. They also worked The Secret Place murder. This book dwells deeply into Conway's complex issues.
"
"Dublin Murder Squad #6: the POV, Antoinette Conway, and her partner Stephen Moran in a masterpiece of psychology, plot, and writing. The young detectives think they have ruined their careers in the investigation of the death of Aislinn Murray, but the gaffer sets them straight and sets them an example of stand-up supervision as well. Great story, great series."
"The ﬁfth novel in French’s “Dublin Murder Squad” series of crime novels. It well and truly keeps up the excellent standard of the other books. It’s interesting how French writes each of these books from a ﬁrst person point of view, but in each book picks a diﬀerent character to tell the story. Often the character is one we have encountered before in one of the other novels. As always, the plot turns in unexpected directions.

Now I just have to wait for French’s next novel, which for the ﬁrst time apparently breaks away from the Murder Squad. I’ve pre-ordered a copy. Obviously."
"Enter Crime and Order

A lot goes on in the head of detective Antoinette Conway, the only woman on Dublins's murder squad. Her loss of the father who dumped his family, and the abuse she faces daily from a team that would like to see her gone, to the doubts that have been planted in her mind about her own partner.
She and her partner Steve are assigned a murder of a young woman who has similar issues to Conway ,and they are also assigned a seasons detective to over see and assist in their investigation."
"A fabulous mystery novel that stands alone without reading the others in the series.

I loved so much about this book--the main character and her partner, the grounding in a sense of place, the depth of character development and how the character's own troubles impacted her work, and of course, a fabulous set of clues and discovery. I will definitely be reading more Tana French in the future."
"How can French keep getting better in this Dublin Murder series? How is that even possible?
I'll never tire of her twisty-turny-plots and carefully sculpted characters that seem nearly fully formed (yet have potential to keep forming as the series itself keeps growing). The story arcs are fabulously detailed and what a roller coaster of a ride. French has never, ever disappointed me.
She is now my go-to for stories and mysteries that keep me guessing to the very end and make me smile with delight throughout."
"Wow! Great detective fiction with a small cast of characters and plenty of twists and turns.

Working in Dublin's murder squad was Antoinette Conway's dream, but her experiences with the other detectives are the stuff of nightmares. When she is about to clock out after a long night shift, she's handed yet another domestic dispute case, but the scene isn't like anything she's experienced before. This case will require her to dig deep and maybe even trust her overly enthusiastic partner. I loved every page!"
"I have a new author crush. This was one of those books that had me dying to find out who did it, and at the same time not wanting to lose contact with the main characters when the story ended. Detective Conway, smart and angry, tough and insecure, cocky one minute and humbled the next. I completely forgave the slightly improbable plot because I was so deeply into Conway's head, her relationships with her partner, and her squad. Loved the grit, the Dublin dialogue, the bleakly noir setting of an investigation where everything went wrong. Can't wait to read another one."
"Tana French just gets better and better. I literally could not put down this book. In addition to the main story line of the death of a young single woman, an obvious suspect, and the involvement of other members of the squad, the two detectives on whom the story focuses learn about human behavior, abandonment, what true loyalty and commitment really are, and, more importantly, about themselves. I can't wait to read French's next book.

I received an ARC in exchange for an objective review."
"Tana French is an exceptional and most underrated writer. All of her books are excellent and each one seems better than the last.

This is an awesome crime read. Deliciously detailed and mesmerizing, brilliantly plotted and excellent character development, you feel like you are a witness to every minute of this intriguing investigation, and that it's all happening in real time.

The wrap-up was surprising and went in a direction I did not expect.

"
This still one of my favorites of the series. This is the second time I have read it and It was just as good as the first time. There are so many good things to say about this book. If you enjoyed other books in this series then this will not disappoint. I don’t think you have to have read the other books but you will for sure have a better feel on the dynamics of the squad if you have. I hope there will be more to this series in the future.
"It's rare, but every so often, I read a book that's so good, I wish I could have a do-over of the time I spent reading just so I could read it for the first time again! The Trespasser by Tana French is one of those books. It's kind of crime, kind of procedural, kind of thriller, kind of literary, kind of suspense, and altogether, just plain awesome. i.e., It's in keeping with the rest of her books. "
"I didn't want this to end. The Secret Place was my first (and still favorite) Tana French book and I loved Conway & Moran. I was looking forward to this one for months, a book from Conway's POV, and this did not disappoint. French's novel's always have a bit of air of melancholy throughout but I was satisfied at the end of this one, although I was sorta hoping Mackey would show up again.
Now I have at least a year for next one and will hope it'll be a combo of Moran and Conway again.

"
"Tana French is an incredible writer. Each novel in the series is a compelling and utterly uncliched story and each one is told by a different narrator. The narrator of this story is, at first, really frustrating: you just want to shake her. But it works. You are drawn into her life as much as the story itself. Occasionally I found this went at a slower pace than French's previous novels but it just required a different approach to reading. "
"Another Impressive Outing

Tana French continues her fantastic Dublin Murder Squad series, as usual changing the POV and with it the style of the book. She's always strong on characters and motivations, but this time around the book is focused inwards multiple, looping, intersecting ways that leave the reader's head spinning. Even people who are good at guessing will have trouble predicting all the bumps in this roller coaster. Very enjoyable read."
"Another great suspense/police procedural by Tana French. Really enjoyed following Detective Conway and her partner as they fought to solve a crime that should have been a slam dunk, but in reality, they discovered to be a beguiling mystery. French is one of the few authors who can write a book this long and keep things so interesting that the reader is never tempted to skip over any of her words!
Highly recommend this one."
"Tana French books are like fine wine...you can't wait to open it, you savor every bit of it and are sad when it is finished....leaving you hoping for another one soon!! I was eagerly awaiting her newest book, and have loved each one. this one is fabulous and doesn't disappoint. I loved the twists and turns...the team of Moran and Conway solve the murder but.....

Now I have to wait another two years for the next one!!"
"French's writing is consistently brilliant, her characters are complex, and her stories are thoroughly fulfilling. This book -- ostensibly about a murder -- is really about the stories we tell others, and the stories others tell us, and what that says about who we are.

Loved how stifling the book was -- in a good way. French manages to convey the difficulty of seeing the big picture in the moment, and of thinking clearly under pressure. Really enjoyed the ride she took us on."
"Love! Love! Love! To date, this is Tana French's best. The character and plot development are superb. Antoinette Nolan is your standard girl detective scrapping in a man's world and out to prove herself with her trusty partner Steve Moran. The mystery almost takes a back seat to the drama around Nolan's growing into her job and learning that the chip on her shoulder is what is preventing her from being part of the team. "
"Listen up readers, this author writes dense, intense novels. She fills them with minute to minute details that you can skim at your own peril. If you do, you'll wind up scratching your head a few pages later and have to go back and re-read. We get to reconnect with Antoinette and Steve from the previous book. It's good to read something of substance here. In spite of an implausible end, I'm giving this a 5 star rating and sending out a big 'thanks' to Rachel for sharing."
"Great read. My only wish with this book is that the main character would've been a tad more likeable. She was just such a wench.... Or maybe a little romance? I know, it's not really Tana French's style and I appreciate her raw characters... They are all broken people and that's a big part of the story. Anyway, great twist in this one. I've read all her books and I think this is my second favorite after The Likeness."
"""Real life"" impinged too much on my enjoyment - in the end, luckily for me, I pulled a muscle in my back and had to take a sick day, so I was able to cozy up to this novel and take my time. Even so, I re-read the last 20 to 30 pages so I could savour the ending. There aren't many who write intelligent, atmospheric psychological suspense like this. Each of her novels have resonated with me, and this one tops them all. I can't wait to see what she does with the next one."
"I almost always wait for library copies, because, let's face it, I couldn't afford to keep up with my reading habit otherwise. But I decided I couldn't wait any longer for this one, and I have no regrets! All of her books are so, so good, and this one is no exception. Look, my only complaint with Tana French books is that once you've finished her latest, you know you have to wait a few years for another."
"Psychological opus -- bravo.

I have read all of Tara French's novels and eager to read this. She didn't disappoint me. This one is her best. The plot is beautifully crafted and kept me drawn in. She is a talented creator of complex characters- particularly cops, specifically women. The novel stands alone. French does not write about the same characters, but there is a hint of characters among them all. Great read."
"Listened to the audiobook since my eyesight is rapidly deteriorating due to degeneration of the macula.

The reader is FABULOUS! Her depiction of Tana French's characters is spot on, intriguing, and deserves an Audie! Tension straight through to the last few minutes - excellent mystery, just excellent.

I have not read anything else by French, though I tried and failed with her first book years ago. I will listen to Book 5 in the series just to encounter Antoinette again."
"Tana French is a brilliant writer with the ability to draw you in to the places she writes about. I really enjoyed her latest book, The Trespasser. Two detectives in the Dublin Murder Squad are assigned a case that seems open and shut but turns out to be anything but. The characters are so well written I felt like I knew them by the end of the book and shared their struggle to solve the case. I highly recommend this book and any of the other Tana French books as well."
"Another case for the Dublin Murder Squad and Detective Antoinette Conway involving a lovers' quarrel gone bad. Or maybe it's something more. This is a terrific police procedural that takes its time revealing its characters layer by layer. Tense and involving right down to its devastating ending , The Trespasser will grip you in surprising ways, and it reveals how deeply character is sculpted by the scars of childhood."
Tana French - where do I begin? She is an extraordinary (in the truest sense of the word) author! This is the second book that I've read by her and I intend to read more. She writes with such insight into the games that people can play and Conway'a character is unforgettable as a female heroine. Going into a Dublin Murder Squad book is like being drawn into a world that lets you ignore your life for a while. Unforgettable. I can't recommend Tana enough!
"Sometimes I want to listen to something light, a single ""straight line "" plot, limited number of characters, easy to follow. And sometimes I want a challenge, a complicated plot that demands concentration. TF delivers these complex plots every single time. It's going to be a while before we get #7 in this series. It'll be worth the wait. (What if TF doesn't write another one? I can't bear to think it.)"
"Another excellent book from Tana French.

I must confess that I looked for a previous main character, Detective Kennedy, of previous books; in fact I was still missing him, till 3/4 through the book. Then I realized, this Author, had again taken me on a journey, and left me unable to stop listening.

Worth the time to listen and back track through previous novels.

Language is a bit colorful, but goes with the grain of the character."
"""Jaysus"" it was hard getting through this book. It was as dense as a neutron star. Compact, oppressive even. Most of this comes from the main character, Conway, who is so pessimistic that if felt like her soul weighed on mine. But her pessimism is hard earned and, while feeling like paranoia, is justified. I stuck it out, got to the end and realized I had read one of the most brilliant crime dramas ever. Just wow!"
" Well written, compelling, character driven detective story. Another winner by an author that doesn't disappoint- each book stands alone yet characters will appear that were minor in one story as major in another. Neither are they formula style whereby the reader comes to anticipate a pattern to the unwinding of the tale.  Humans are imperfect- our heroes are flawed and villains have soft spots. "
"Excellent book! My first Tana French novel. Out of order, but I was unaware that it mattered. A very well written ""Who Dun It""! Makes me want to find an Irish Pub and have a pint!
French is great at developing characters and leading the reader in new directions. One of those books that make you wonder how an author can pull all of that out of their heads and put it on paper. I'll be looking up more of her books soon!"
"This book was GOOD. I hesitated bc of some of the reviews, but those people are all CRAY- this book was fabulous. People don't like Conway?!?! WHAT?!?! Are you insane?! I loved her. And Steve?!?! Shut the front door. This is my second favorite after Broken Harbour and honestly, they might be tied. Great murder mystery, great characters, great writing. What else are people looking for?!?! Man it was good. SO GOOD. "
"Tana French has been a favorite author of mine since her first book, In The Woods. Her writing style is like comfort food to me....or comfort words.... which probably is really strange since she writes murder mysteries. This is her 6th book, written over a span of years. Each book has a character or two from the previous book, but they are new stand alone stories, not sequels. I have enjoyed every one!"
Never liked detective fictions but this is somehow different. Very good dialog and the story moves along well. I was anxious to get back to it when I put it down. First one of the series of Tana French's about Antionette Conway. Other reviewers have said best to start at the beginning to see how the character develops. Probably increases the appreciation of the novels but this stands up well on it's own. I'll probably begin with the first and slowly work my way through
"This is the first Tana French book I have read and I am so happy. It reminds me of when I meet someone who hasn't watched "" Happy Valley"" and I am so excited for them and so jealous of all the goodness they have ahead of them. I am jealous of me! All these Tana books out there that I haven't read yet. Her writing is fantastic. Her characters are likeable and complicated and hilarious and smart and dark. And did I mention Irish? I am in love."
"Excellent. I love this series. The way French writes these detectives is just brilliant. And the interrogations! The interrogations in this book are masterful. Incredibly complex and layered. She's playing a game of chess between the detectives and the suspect, but she's also playing a totally different game of chess with the reader. And the journey Conway goes on in this book. Her frustrations and suspicions and ultimately what comes of all that is so rich and nuanced. Stellar. "
I could not put this one down. 
I absolutely loved this one! The Dublin murder squad books are some of the best...broken harbour is still my favorite but this is a close second now. The Audible versions are my fave way to read these they are done very well. Tana French is just amazing at writing 10/10
Great murder mystery will look for others in the series.
"Loved it so so much that I can't rave enough about it.
Really enjoyed the read especially since it was different from my last one which had a big plot twist, while this one dived deep into the characters and how they managed things while getting to solve the case, its like Tana French wanted us to give more attention to the characters than to try finding who done it, also liked how the characters are so wity, especially Antoanette"
This was my second read of this book. The first time on an ereader and the second time with a book. The experience was somehow different. I knew I had read the book before but enjoyed it so much that I thought I would try it again. Still read every word and enjoyed it but I was trying to understand what the author was doing that held the interest when the story wasn't moving very quickly. It is a well written book. 
"I love police procedurals, especially English and Irish ones, and I loved this book. It’s much more about life and workplace issues than about crime. Many times, the detectives will have boringly desperate personal lives full of alcohol and misery. This novel eschews that.

I would say that a few moments made me uncomfortable, just felt like the pejorative terms used didn’t need to be there, and were more distracting than useful."
"Not a review of just this book, but I’ve very much enjoyed every book in this series. French is a great writer, and her ability to continue to give her different characters distinct voices makes it all the better. Hate a secondary character in one book, and in another when they become a lead, you love them.

I’ve especially loved the female detectives, Cassie is my tops, but Antoinette is a close second. I’ll likely re-read all of these again, awaiting more."
"I love Tana French's books and the murder squad. This one did not fail me! The narrator was more relatable than her other narrators for me. She was quick, witty, and just the right amount of paranoid. I loved the way the characters bounced off each other. I felt close to Moran and Conway and like I knew so much about them without drowning in descriptions. There weren't major twists but the way this book was written, big shockers weren't needed."
"Gosh she is a good writer, although sometimes I'm not sure I'm reading English (well, it's not--it's Dublish! [Dublin English LOL]. It was hard to get into this at first, since it is SOOO different from the Georgette Heyer immersion of the last month or so. But the story is great, the characters are great, the writing is terrific. I got sucked in and enjoyed it, as always"
"One of her very best. The first person narration pulls you in immediately and then it's a non-stop read to the end. Fascinating psychological suspense, riveting story told by a narrator whose intelligence and emotional quirks kept this reader deeply invested until the rewarding end. French has written another top notch read."
"Utterly terrific; probably the best of all the Tana French's...featuring the same pair as the last book, this one comes from Antoinette's perspective and she is a fabulous character; smart and paranoid and likeable and infuriating...all at once. And the mystery is compelling; believable; and satisfying. Can't ask for anything more. "
"Another stunning achievement from Ms. French....

An amazing read. Like her previous novels, this novel is singular in its remarkable ability to explore the depths and complexities of human nature while thickening the tension like a clotted artery. Brava. I simply couldn't stop till I finished."
" ""The Trespasser"" was amazing. Fascinating characters, clever plot (including the perfect red herring), an interesting location, and some of the best writing found in contemporary crime fiction. For more info on Tana French see the article about her and her books in the September 26, 2016 issue of ""The New Yorker."" "
"Tana French does no wrong. i feel like i write every review the same when it comes to the Dublin Murder Squad Series, but I blow through these books because her characters and dialogue are so freaking awesome.

Glad she's written another novel from a female POV. Antoinette is awesome!
So, really just read these books. They don't disappoint."
"This book may have been her best yet and I have obsessed over all of them. I have been waiting over a year for her new book and it was worth all of the anticipation. After several consecutive hours and several anxiety attacks from the intensity, I am only sorry that it is over. Get to writing Ms. French! You have a fan ready for your next book!"
"Fabulous Dublin Murder Squad novel, with Antoinette as the main character. I love the way French lets the protagonist's thoughts flow, and the reader doesn't know what is real, and what is unreliable narrator. The story of a young girl murdered in her home, with the boyfriend the main suspect, is way more complicated that expected. Can't wait for the next one!"
"Tana French is back on form. Dublin Squad #5 (The Secret Place) was a little sketchy, with all the witchy supernatural elements that just didn't quite gel, but this one staring the bitchy, feisty, and oh so vulnerable Antoinette Conway and her sidekick, the puppy-faced but fiercely loyal Stephan Moran, is a real gem. The journey is unpredictable and the ending does not disappoint. "
"Another masterful mystery by Tana French. I was a bit worried after the fifth book, but The Trespasser is up to her usual gold standard. Stayed up almost all night to finish because I just couldn't put it down!

Half of the fun is guessing which character she'll write about next. Crossing my fingers for the next book to be about our enigmatic gaffer. :)"
"Her best so far...and that's saying something. The pacing is fantastic, leaving you unsure until almost the very last page. Her descriptions are practically poetic and spot on. Her characters are real, fallible and enduring. I prolonged the reading, parcelling out a few pages at a time, not wanting it to end. "
"If you want a story that is interesting and complicated with all kinds of inner dialogue, then this is for you. I liked the way Tana makes you want to keep reading.

If you want a story with interesting characters and a complicated crime then this is for you. tana French makes you want to keep reading as the case has twists and turns."
Tana French has done it again! Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are back working together on a case. But this is no ordinary detectives solve mystery tale. French is a master of weaving complicated plots together with in depth character development. You know these people when you finish the book and you miss them when the book ends. I cannot wait for her next one!
"As far as I'm concerned Tana French can just dump the entire Dublin Murder Squad and start a new Antoinette Conway series. Hers is the most hard-boiled yet believable personality I've come across in any mystery book - actually in any  book period - I've read. At the very least, I hope that whichever character French features next will include Conway in their story. "
"So so good. Complex, character driven, and so suspenseful. I love the ups and downs of the tempo, and how the slow parts let you know you're not missing a beat - everything Conway thinks is shared so you're there the whole time. Could've used a little less 'everybody hates me' melodramatics but overall a 5 star read - Tana French does it again!"
"Another riveting book from Tana French. I found her latest novels not as ""dark"" as her first couple, but page-turners all the same. This main character was probably my least favorite of all French's novels. I don't dislike Conway, but I would sometimes be annoyed by her attitude through some parts of the story. It didn't affect my not being able to put the book down, though. "
"For fans of Tana French, your prayers have been answered. This is her best yet. Good characters, satisfying plot, and well written. (My only gripe is that her first-person narrator, a cop evidently not expected to have good grammar, says, ""Me and my partner did xyz."" I can't stand it!)
You won't be disappointed."
"This book is a stunner. I am a big fan of Tana French. She continues to hit all the right notes, even as her protagonists change from book to book. This is a powerful story with as much squad politics as murderous intent. The ending is breathtaking, for all kinds of reasons. Highly recommended."
"Absolutely loved this book. Im always suspicious when I guess the ending correctly because while I'm clever, it means I've encountered a writer who is not only skillful at telling a tale, but enchanting me with the plot. I felt sympathy with the heroine, and could not anticipate the twists of the plot. I was actually sad when the end arrived. "
"Tana French is a master. I will read anything she writes, sight unseen. This book grabbed me from page one and never let go. I can't say that the mystery to the murder is a cliff hanger. The characters, dialogue and accents are what makes it all so authentic and gripping. The bad part about reading a Tana French mystery is that it is such a long wait until I get to read the next one!"
"A who-dun-it of epic proportions. The author manages to weave suspense carefully so as not to be outlandish. Murder squad Detective Antoinette is meticulously crafted and is just as important a part of the story as the case she is working. Aislinn, the vic, is also quite a character. Steve Moran, Murder squad partner, and Breslin, sweet-talker, round out the cast quite nicely. "
"Tana French can do very little wrong... her writing is fast-paced but thoughtful and she's good at managing a few twists and turns while still fleshing out her characters. They're never one-note and always flawed, but somehow easy to root for. If you're new to this series, I recommend starting from the beginning. They can each stand on their own, but it would be a shame to miss any one of them."
"Uffda. Tana French is a badass author. Reading her books is not a relaxing activity; half the time, I feel quite anxious. But I can never put the book down and I always end up thinking, ""Wow."" This was no exception. I don't think it's 100% necessary to read her previous books for this one to make sense, but I think you'll enjoy them more if you read them in order."
"This was on my first Book of the Month selection and I am beyond pleased with my choice! I lost a lot of sleep staying up late reading this book. It was too good to put down! I hadn't ready any of the previous books in this series but I did not feel that I missed any important details. Though I have now added the rest of the series to my 'want to read"" list. "
"I love every minute of this book. Tana French is a beautiful writer and I am always especially captivated by her characters. All of the characters are complex and I find myself thinking about them long after I put the book down. Antoinette is a particularly great character--strong, intelligent, confident, and flawed. I would love to read a dozen more books about Antoinette and Stephen. "
"Re Tana French, just when I think she must have peaked and couldn't possibly keep the calibre up, she comes up with another astonishingly good novel. This time I actually listened to an unabridged narration which was read by ? in a beautiful Irish accent. Laugh out loud in parts, creepy, excellent."
"Fair play to Tana French. Her novels are a treat I wait impatiently for, thus always buying in hardback. This novel is set in Dublin but the plot and characters would work anywhere. The dialogue however is wonderfully Irish. This novel has plot twists and turns that keep you guessing to the very end. If you love detective novels Tana French is a must read"
"“Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe…”

Perhaps the greatest of Tana French's books, I loved this one. I finished it, then went back to page 1 and started reading it again.

"
"This cop murder mystery kept suspense thru to the last page. Longer than Tara French's other books, there were a couple times I felt she put in a bit too much detail, but when all was said & done, I understood why.
French is so good at creating characters 3-dimensional. They are people the reader cares about.
Well done, Ms. French."
"Wow wow wow.
I have respect for the entire Dublin Murder Squad collection but In The Woods remained my favorite through them all...until now. A new side of the Squad with the same bite of Tana French. I rarely get into crime novels, let alone an entire collection, but Tana brings a whole new punch to the genre that is impossible to ignore!"
"Really really good. The latest in the Dublin Murder mystery series - but these can be read individually. They're not truly serial. This is a proper murder mystery with red herrings and dead ends. The last few of French's books, I wasn't as crazy about as I was with the first couple, but this one feels like a return to form. Highly recommended."
"When a favorite author has a new book come out, I have mixed reactions: wanting to read it immediately or stalling to read it because I know there will be a wait until another. This time I somewhat stalled but could wait no longer and French did not disappoint with The Trespasser. Now I wait for her next book."
"I love French's books--they're methodical but addicting, and never paint any character as all good or all bad. This fairly-long, but absolutely engaging book, deals with one murder that Antoinette and her partner, both Dublin murder investigators, are trying to solve. It's well-written and the kind of book that makes you want to get home early from work to read :-)."
"What an amazing story, so much detail it makes for a long read but well worth following to the end. A murder, mystery about two young Irish, rookie detectives and a case they have to solve which they believe to be a domestic. The story is about how they investigate and deal with the results they find. I was exhausted by the end but so satisfied with the conclusion."
This book will have you guessing with every page turn. The complex murder case is worked in comprehensive detail by Detective Antoinette Conway. Det. Conway is taken through a series of twists and turns and at times questions her own beliefs. but perserves even those doubts until she solves the crime. Great read. 
"I loved the Irish narrator. In fact, I've gone audio for most of French's Dublin Murder Squad series for that reason. After a few minutes you get the hang of it. This story was richly complex and suspenseful. The conclusion was satisfying, unexpected and well crafted. A solidly paced mystery with characters I hope to meet again."
"I'm a big Tana French fan and I've read all of her books. I'm not sure this is my favorite, but that's like saying I like Ferraris better than Maseratis. Does that mean Maseratis are garbage? Of course not. Really, how can you compare. French is a master and if you want a class on how to write character driven as well as plot driven fiction, you can't do better than study her books. "
"With superior writing and outstanding characterization Tana French transcends the mystery genre. Told in the first person, tough and angry police detective Antoinette Conway tells the story of the search for a murderer. She includes a picture of police culture and police techniques along with a clever and ingenious plot. "
"Unlike many writers, I think her books have gotten better as the series has gone on. The protagonist of this one is certainly flawed and a bit tiring with her martyr complex, but Ms. French still manages to make her understandable and sympathetic. The whole package really works. I continue to be impressed with her novels. "
"""I hit the pedal hard and let the Kadett pretend it's a real car while it gets us out of there. I get the sudden nasty feeling like the trees behind us have snapped together and come down, with a silent roar and a smash of branches, onto the spot where we were parked.""
That quote from the beginning of the book captures the essence of the book. Aside from her first two this is my favorite."
"This book is a perfect example of what a police procedural should be. The crime is intricately woven and complex, the detectives are flawed and complicated, and the dialogue is cracking. Also, I think Detective Antoinette Conway might be my new personal life coach. I'm praying that Tana French brings her back in a future book; go team Conway! "
"Each one better than the last. I just love this whole series. Tight plotting and writing, but the best is that the central detective is different in every book, so you see each case through a different set of assumptions, skills, and values, while detectives you've already gotten to know return as supporting players. Now I'll have to go back to waiting for the next one..."
"Great book. I wished it was Breslin. I was glad but saddened the gaffer did the right thing for what it meant to him and because, however terrible he was not informing the family about the run away dad, I don't think McCann meant to kill her. My favorite character was Steve, underrated much smarter and wiser than originally perceived. I look forward to the next book. "
"The reasons French is one of my favorite crime story authors are the following: her devotion to detail, the realistic dialogue, the sense of tension that continually builds, and the satisfying way she wraps up each Murder Squad drama. Antoinette and Steven are flawed and wonderful; you root for them and wonder if they'll come out of this alive. In a nutshell, I love her books.

"
"It's great to find a new (for me) author of police procedurals. Tana French writes beautifully in ""detective diction,"" and the plotting is complex but not confusing. One major theme could be summed up as ""Thinking makes it so,"" or the consequences of looking at facts through the lens of one's own needs, paranoia, or fantasies."
"If you enjoy mysteries, then you will enjoy this series. Tana French writes fully developed characters who wrestle with their own demons as they try to solve murder cases. I find myself caring about each character and wanting to see them succeed. Having read the series, I know that the protagonists may not always ""win"", but that as a reader, I will be satisfied with the outcome."
"Read them all!

I absolutely Loved this series! Hoping for more from the Dublin murder squad! Please give us more of these wonderful characters"
"Dublin Murder Squad does it again! Lots of drama among the squad members. Classy young woman dead. Murder or accident? Obvious assailant or somebody else? Everybody is hiding something. Who can you trust? Will the right person get arrested and charged? I could not say until the last page. And the end soo worked. Thanks, Tana French."
"EXCELLENT police procedural. Well-drawn characters--especially the protagonist-- a compelling mystery, and a plot that explores the psyche of cops as well as criminals (sometimes, both at the same time). I need to read more from this author!"
"Rating: 5/5!
Word count: 145,000~ words (9h30min @ 1 page per min)
Why this book: I love Tana French and have been hooked since I read In the Woods in the summer of 2012.
Biggest strength: Characterization/Writing style - just beautiful
Biggest weakness: Plot - it's a little weak/slow in the middle

"My favorite Dublin Murder Squad so far. Interesting, vivid characters and an intriguing plot. I don't want to give too much away, but I kept thinking that they should have followed up with a key source who told them at the beginning about the possible perp. That's my only criticism. I hope French writes another one with Antoinette Conley as the lead."
"I'd give this book 6 stars if I can. 1 for being less bleak than the previous books of Dublin Murder Squad while still have formidable characters, cutting lines and police procedure that feels real(for an outside reader anyway). Still, NOT a Sunny-day-afternoon-tea-bright book so it's the perfect balance for me at least.
Adding it to mix up my recommendation list a bit."
"Tana French is an absolutely OUTSTANDING author. The unreal description that puts you right there and in the main character’s head… the intricate plot building with twists and turns… I’m honestly surprised this doesn’t have an overall higher rating. Such an excellent, well crafted story. Definitely going on my favorites shelf."
"This is my favorite Tana French book. I found the characters intriguing and the tangle of human interactions so realistic. It really wasn't the mystery that hooked me but the characters. I finished the book and immediately started reading again, finding that I liked it even better the second time. "
"My favourite of the series. Excellent plot twists, great characters and the dialogue is outstanding. I stayed up most of the night to finish it, and it was worth it.
I received this book in an online giveaway in exchange for an honest review."
"When I heard that I had an ARC of The Trespasser coming, I was delighted, and it didn't disappoint. French's combination of richly human characters and tightly plotted police procedural novel continues to be a winner. I can't wait for #7 in the series!"
Wonderful and intense as all the rest. I wanted to take it slower but I couldn't. All about our daydreams of reality versus the actual thing and how we mess ourselves up that way. Plus a whole lot more. 
"Five stars for the consistent delivery. The Trespasser is not as good as The Secret Place or In the Woods, but it's still good. And Tana French just doesn't disappoint. It's a relief, on the heels of so many other disappointing follow-ups this fall."
"I would like to live in a world where I could cozy up in a chair and read from an infinite stack of Tana French novels. Til then, if anyone knows of other writers in this genre who come close to her caliber, please share your insights with me so I can devour all their books too!
"
"Excellent. Started off as a run of the mill murder mystery but quickly evolved into something far better. Full of twists and turns, a few surprises especially the end. I felt like I was in that world of the Dublin Murder Squad. Highly recommend!"
"Fantastic; this will also rank among my favorites of Tana French's books. She does so much in such a tightly plotted story, and I love her humor and her characters. The only problem with enjoying the latest book is now I have to wait so long for the next one. :("
I love Tana French's writing. Great fully developed characters. This book was quite straightforward. Her other books had more twists and turns and surprises. Either that or I've gotten much more used to her work. A solid 4+!
"Love, love, love Tana French! Consistently good storytelling that draws you in immediately and keeps you enthralled to the end. Interesting characters and a great Irish flair that brings you right into Dublin's midst."
"It just maybe doesn't get any better than Tana French's books, and this was no exception. I was riveted until the very last page. The writing, the character development, the incredible plot - oh, man."
"Everything I expected. Complex, gripping, psychologically satisfying. I wish I had another French book to pick up right away... well maybe tomorrow because this one was good enough that I'll have to let it sit for a while in my stomach."
"Very difficult to review without risking spoilers, so I'll just go big picture and say that I don't believe there has ever in the history of ever been a better writer of police procedurals than Tana French. And it's not close."
Wow - could not put this one down - Conway and Moran and their relationship important part of the book - loved the way much of the story was in interviews with witnesses and suspects - clear your diary if you are going to read this one.
"I love Tana French. Her books are so captivating they're nearly impossible to put down. I neglected everything while I devoured The Trespasser. Love her strong, fiery female protagonists. Five enthusiastic stars!"
"Tana French is a master writer. So much detail, amazing character development, excellent plot twists that keep you guessing, and it's all credible enough to seem like it could really happen. I am amazed at how each of her novels is so different and yet so well-done."
"Another brilliant book by Tana French. She blends psychology, mystery, and a lot of fucked up people into a gut punch of a book. She remains on my must read immediately upon release authors (I don't have many). "
"I LOVED this book. It's a crime story, as part of a series, but with rich character development and the required twists and turns. I've read one other book in this series but am now anxious to go back and read them all.

This was definitely one of my favourite books of the year so far."
"I keep thinking Tana French will take a misstep, like many authors do, but she never does. I absolutely love each and every book of hers and hope she turns another one out soon.
They are so layered, the characters, the plots, the humanity.... She is amazing."
"Ugh. I LOVED this one!! Before Faithful Place was my favorite in this series but it might be The Trespasser now. Antoinette is so badass, flawed, and just an awesome character. Just hope the ending doesn't signal the end of the Dublin Murder Squad series. "
"Tana French gets better with every book. I could not put this one down. I was completely taken with what could have happened to Aislin Murray, and boy was it worth the read. Each detective in the Dublin Murder Squad is uniquely brilliant, and I can't wait for the next one. "
"Tana French has done it again. Just a fantastic read, as always, I could not put it down. Six books in and each one is just as good as the last!!! Cannot recommend this book (and the rest of them) highly enough."
"This book is one of French's best. Complete with all of the emotional complexity and literary beauty one can expect from a Tana French novel, without some of the magical realism that was present in her last two books. I loved it."
"If could add two more stars to this review, I would. French is supremely satisfying. She is to crime what Alice Munro is to short story writing...both women stretch the form, move down surprising hallways, offer deep character revelation and remain at the edge of their form. What a treat!"
"The last book was the first book of Tana French's I didn't love. Halfway through this book, I started to think maybe Tana French had lost her touch. I was wrong. In fact, I want more. I hope to see glimpses of these characters in the future. Can't wait to see who the next book will be about!"
"Tana French does some wonderful things with point of view, plotting, and atmosphere. And you can't beat ""hearing"" the wonderful Irish accents. Already looking forward to her next Dublin Murder Squad case!"
"So good that I read it within a week. Beautiful language, a gripping plot, and a searing examination of gender, class, and violence in modern Ireland. The voices of the characters are particularly well done—each character is distinct and vivid without becoming a caricature."
"A deep psychological journey

Inside the Dublin murder squad things are tough. A young woman preparing a romantic dinner is murdered, that starts a twisting ride down a rabbit hole of police work and subterfuge."
"For a book without much physical action, this certainly packed a punch. A psychological thriller that I savored over days. Many know that I am a fast reader, yet I forced myself to slow down and savor this book, it is that good. Highly recommend this and all the rest of French's books."
"Outstanding story of misperceptions, misconceptions, and misdirection. Love love love this latest installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Dying to know who the author picks out next to tell a story."
"4 1/2 stars - as I've mentioned before, I compare all Tana French's books to ""Faithful Place"", and while I really enjoyed this one, it wasn't quite as good. I got a little tired of Antoinette's paranoia, but other than that, it was a total page turner. Highly recommended!"
Great story. Kept me interested until the bitter end. I've read all of this authors books and this is definitely the one I've enjoyed reading the most. Can't wait to hear about this pairs next investigation.
"Tana French has done it again! Even though it is book six in the Dublin Murder Squad series it can be read as a standalone.. It is a gritty crime thriller which leaves you guessing to the end.

It is a well crafted, well written book and I recommend it!
.."
"Another fantastic police procedural set in Dublin by Tana French. I highly recommend the audio version read by Hilda Fay, whose ability to re-create the voices of the characters adds an extra level of authenticity."
"I really enjoyed this book, as I do of all Tana French books. The first chapter or so I was unsure how much I was going to like the main character. But then all of a sudden I found myself engrossed in the book. I'm now sad I'll have to wait for another Dublin Murder Squad book! "
"I really didn't know how it was going to play out. The final few pages... I was pretty sure it was going to go that way, but based on her other books, I couldn't be 100%.

But Conway is still unlikable. I tried to understand her but it's hard!"
"Another stunner from the Dublin Murder Squad. I listened to this one and thoroughly enjoyed the Irish accent of the reader. I couldn't get enough of this, and listened when I should have been doing other things! The interrogation sequences were especially riveting. Great book."
"Wonderful character study of the complex, prickly detective Antoinette Conway, and to a lesser extent, Steven Moran, trying to solve murder of young woman, unwilling to accept main suspect as guilty.
"
"This engrossing book is mystery/police fiction at a very, very high level. She has an ability to put you into the minds of very complex characters who are in very complex situations. I rarely finish a book and say ""Wow"", but this was one of those times."
"This latest entry in the compelling Dublin Murder Squad series puts us inside the head of the very defensive Detective Antoinette Conway, who has to contend with hostile coworkers while investigating what appears to be a routine domestic murder. Keep them coming, Tana French!"
❤ Tana French books. The story lines are great and so is her character development. There's something about her writing that makes it hard for me to put down the book. I get invested in the characters. 
"Loved this smart and witty police detective thriller. It gets bonus points for its Dublin setting and Irish references. While the title implies it is part of a series, it's a book that can be read on a stand alone basis without any need to be caught up with the companion novels. "
"Just finished The Trespasser. Spellbound right until the end, by it all -- the language, dialogue, scene setting, descriptions, characters, plot -- the whole package. Tana French is an amazing writer, an inspiration to those of us who long to be just that. "
"as cynical and ready to fight the world as she is i really love conway's joy at her and steve's partnership and how well they work together. aside from that, this case was interesting and twisty and i thought i'd guessed it about five times and i was wrong every time until the very end. "
"Enjoyed it tremendously; this is one of her best, perhaps the best of her novels. I loved the character development, loved the way the story unfolds, and especially loved the psychological insights about the way we are all influenced by the stories we tell ourselves. "
I have read all Tana French's books. I have to tell you this was my favorite. I could not stop listening to it on audible.com. The narrator was fantastic. Book kept me guessing until the end. Highly recommend this read.
"One week in a Dublin murder squad

Combine a great story with great writing and this book is what you get. The lead character, a woman detective, and her partner try to figure out the murder of a young woman."
I love mysteries and I especially love British/Irish crime dramas. French writes it's such depth of detail. Treats the reader as intelligent and let's you become part of the investigation. Another great read and fascinating exploration of human nature and all it's flaws. 
"A tour de force from Tana French. Her best work to date, completely engrossing. She is at the top of her form here, which pleases me as I struggled with the novel that preceded this one. Doesn't get better than this."
"This is as close as French has gotten to The Likeness, her high water mark so far. The finely wrought victim character, the flaws in the narrator/protagonist, the overall tragedy of the crime recall the novel that made me fall for her in the first place. "
"Like all of her books, I can't wait to finish it then am upset it's over. Oh, well...we wait for the next one. Who will be the minor character here that will be the main character next? I'm hoping Fleas!

Tana French, master storyteller!!"
"Best yet in French's Dublin Squad mystery series. As usual excellent characterization as well as a plot full of twists that keeps the listener enthralled. Reader for audio version (Hilda) mesmerizing. if a six star rating were available, it would earn all of them!
"
I'd forgotten how good tana French is 
Tana French definitely didn't disappoint. It was a bit slow but it didn't feel boring. It speeded up towards the end as any good detective novel does. Hilda Fay the reader is fantastic. Its probably an even better listen than read. I look forward to more wonderful stories by Tana French.
"Another great read from one of my favorite authors. There were times when I wondered why this was wandering all over the place, but by the end I was knocked out of my socks! The stories we create indeed!"
"This one might just be my favorite. I can highly recommend the audio version, as read by Hilda Fay, who does a superb job pegging Antoinette's voice. I gupled down the 20 hours or so of the audiobook by finding places to walk to slowly so I didn't have to pause the story very often."
"Enjoyed

Enjoyed the book. Fun reading a story written in another part of the world and getting a bit of a look at what that part of the world is like. Also a well written mystery, fun read."
"Tana French just writes amazing thrillers. This is another great one in this series. It's amazing that she can take a protagonist who is somewhat unlikeable -- kind of paranoid, very cynical, quickly dismissive -- and make the reader completely empathize with her. "
This is another excellent entry into one of my favorite series. I felt like this one was so much more character driven - lots of twists and turns - both with the mystery and the feelings of the main character. 
"Brilliant. And SO much more than a mystery, procedural, or crime story. It's about stories and perspectives, and what we choose to believe. How easily wounded we are. It offers the possibility for accepting our shared, flawed, humanity. Best yet."
"Another great novel by French

An amazingly good yarn with jaw dropping writing...witty, clear, palpable! Strong character development. You may not like the characters but they are real! Loved this book."
French is at her best. Rookie Ds thrown to the wolves to screw up a complicated domestic murder. One can never guess what dreams are going on inside of the heads you see every minute of every day ... Probably a good thing. *****
"What can I say about this book that others haven't said? Just read it. In fact read every book that has Tana French's name on it. You will not be disappointed.

I certainly hope there will be another book after this one."
"Stayed up later than I should tonight because I couldn't put it down. Tana French has yet to let me down, and this may be one of her best, up there with Broken Harbor and In The Woods.

Now I have to wait for her next."
Although set in Dublin I think the setting of a police murder squad room is probably pretty universal. I like how French shows that it is not easy figuring out crime details and how extensive the process is. Lots of interesting twists and turns. Enjoy!
This is the first of the Dublin Murder Squad books I have read. It was compelling and all of those other words/phrases used to say I couldn't put it down. I may have to go back and read the earlier ones now. 
"Wonderful Whodunnit

This was a well paced,highly nuanced piece of detective fiction. In addition to a great plot the novel contains many highly developed,interesting characters. I have read quite a few Tana French novels and have never been disappointed!"
"This was captivating. I don't read too many murder mystery novels, but this one focused more on the interactions between the detectives and the psychology of lying and manipulating conversations. I was thankful that it wasn't too graphic."
"These stories are really fantastic! They're well-written with fairly deep themes and intricate plots. And they don't get stale because she changes the main character from book to book, with each main character as a secondary character from a previous book."
"I loved this book! I'm a fan of Tana French, & I think this is one of her best. Detective Conway makes an interesting narrator, the characters are so well rounded that you want to know all the why's and how's of the case, not just who did it. "
"I love Tana French so much. Couldn't put this down, which is the case with all of her books. She does a great job keeping the reader on her toes, and has so many clever plot twists and surprises. Also great depth to her characters. Love!"
"I love Tana French. However, this particular book, unlike many of her other works, did not leave me feeling attached to the characters or wanting more. The protagonist honestly annoyed me.. and that usually does not happen. However, I love her work all the same and look forward to other books."
"My favorite two leads since Cassie, and while I solved the murder way before they did, what matters in French books is always the people and their dynamics. Trespasser delivered, as French always does. "
"French compels me to live as Antoinette Conway - to inhabit the world as she does - and to adopt her vision as my own. I am a Detective Garda with a partner who would die for me, and we will make the truth come out. Audio version is phenomenal."
"Tana French blows me away! In this last book, she jerks the reader around like a puppet on a string. And I am totally entranced with her writing style, her metaphors, her dialogue. I had a little difficulty understanding the narrator in this last book, but aside from that, a total winner!"
"Another great read. Tana French keeps me interested from start to finish. And really makes you think about how complicated, messy and flawed people are. All people, no matter which side they're on.
Must read."
"It's a Tana French book, so OF COURSE I loved it and fell a little in love with the lead characters and wanted to read it again as soon as it ended."
Her best yet - a treat.
"These two can get their own spinoff any damn time now.

""No shit. Bye.""

I might get it tattooed somewhere."
Spectacular job by Tana French once again. A true page-turner and the characters are very well-developed. You both love and get very frustrated by Conway.
"I think this may be her best work yet. Gripping, well written, with great twists. I LOVED IT!"
Can highly recommend the audio book
"Another fantastic story from French. Once again, the psychological aspect was so good! A great distraction when I needed it and I'm so sorry it's over. Time to start re-reading her others "
Brilliant as always!
Tana is amazing as each book just gets better and better. Fab read
"What a good book! I will definitely read more books by this author - she wries well, but more than anything she tells a great story!"
"See
Goodreads
Review
previously written"
"This book was like riding a roller coaster. The plot was strong and the characters well defined.
I would recommend to any reader who like police procedures."
One of my favorite authors. This book lived up to the others. 
"Out of her six books, this is probably my favorite. The constant twists and turns in the story line are equaled only by her character development of the two main characters. I really enjoyed it!"
"Tana French! Tana French! Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran and Tana French!

(Reading! It's the best!)"
Tana 
Another great story.
A wonderful mystery with depth. Love the characters and the dialog. Beautifully written with great insight into character. Another amazing Tana French novel.
Could not put it down!! Woke up at 5 & grabbed my book!!
Hauntingly good
Probably her best book - and that's saying a lot. Visceral power in the language. Sophisticated plot. Strong & complex female protagonist who's tough as nails.
Brilliant. Lots of good twists and plot and character development. 
I can't wait for her next book the minute I finish! The Irish detective hung gets me every time...
Tana French is probably among my favorite three mystery writers. Her novels take place in Ireland and she has terrific character development. 
"Loved it.

Love her books, writing style, characters and stories.been waiting for this book to come out.... And it definitely did not disappoint!"
I'm pretty sure this is my favorite DMS book so far. French is masterful. 
"Another hit by French...

Kept me turning the pages, hoping it would never end. Always looking forward to her next one. She doesn't disappoint .






"
Could not put it down.
Twisty to the very end. 
"Just as good as her previous books--complex, compelling characters and story."
"A great read.. This story is full of dialog between the members of the Murder Squad and how they interact on this case. Takes place in Ireland
"
"Tana French is just a master at storytelling. Great writing, characterization, and plot. "
Loved it. One of the characters was so irritating that I wanted to throw the book occasionally but still - so worth it! 
First rate! So much more than a police procedural. One of my favorite authors.
I wish I could give this 10 stars.
"Boy, oh boy. Tana French is back and at the top of her game. I started this book, and it's a wonder I got anything done over the last ten days. "
I love Tana French
"Man... This is what I've been waiting for since The Likeness. I couldn't put this ending together even though I had the pieces. What a satisfying read, I couldn't put it down."
Loved this book! Hate to have to wait another year for new one!
Tana French's books are all amazing and this one is no exception. Great characters and a gripping plot. Top notch!
I LOVE this Tana French series. NOTE: no need to read them in order. This is the BEST kind of police murder mystery - not sure who's guilty of what until the end. A GREAT book!
I swear TF gets better and better with each book.
Antoinette Conway has just become my favorite Tana French character. 
THIS WAS SO GOOD. I know that the next book will have a new protagonist but I want a series just with Conway and Moran. I would be so happy.
Tana French writes complicated crime mysteries so perfectly that they are a pleasure to lose myself in. They are more than a who-dun-it; her use of language and characters make the story memorable. 
I will always love everything Tana French writes! 
Another great mystery from Tana French. I love that all of her stories are so different. 
Once again Tana French delivers a detective story that is deliciously absorbing. A long-awaited read and the only disappointment is that it's now over!
So well written that I never want her books to end. Another fantastic story!
One of her best.
"This maybe my favorite mystery series. The way the author portrayed Conway's ""thoughts"" was marvelous. "
I love the Murder Squad books. The characters are always well drawn and the mysteries are engrossing. 
Deadly.
Great story. Great narrator. Sad that it's over but it was well done. 
Magnificent. 
Excellent writing by Tana French. She's definitely one of my favorite authors.
"Smart

Good fiction, halfway decent whodunnit, but better writing than you'd expect. Maybe a little hard boiled but easily read overall."
Excellent!
This is the very best of the Dublin Murder Squad. One of the best murder mysteries I have ever read. You won't be disappointed in Tana French as she weaves quite a plot this time.
Tana French has another top thriller to add to her resume. Excellent!
"5 stars!!
I love Tana French.
And the reader of the audio book, Hilda Fay is equally wonderful.
But now I'm sad because how long must we wait for the next one?!"
Extremely strong language. 
"Best Dublin Murder Squad ever. Female detective, 1st person. Loved every second. "
Love this author and this is another book that does not disappoint - kept me interested to the end 
I think this is my favorite of Tana French's books so far. I keep thinking about it. 
"Excellent storytelling and character building from Ms. French, as always. "
"Loved it!
"
"damn good! excuse my words, but good Lord a very good read."
"Excellent mystery! And Antionette is a perfectly painted portrait of a career woman in a man's world - brash, sharp, dogged - and a little paranoid."
"Brilliant

I got lost but then found my way back again. Incredible writer, keeps you thinking with different plot twists, enjoy."
Powerful stuff. Made me want to go back and re-read/re-listen to some of the old ones. Her storytelling is amazing.
"Somewhat wordy, but good story."
An engrossing read. I thoroughly enjoyed it as I have all her books
So good!!
"The title didn't seem the best for this novel. The book was great, very absorbing, couldn't put it down. Several twists. Detective Conway still reigns."
Tana French reaffirms her genius with every book.
Awesome description and characterization - the mental games and lies and misinterpretations had my mind bouncing.
"My only regret is that Antoinette and Steve will not be our protagonists come book 7.
Tana French and fine wine..."
This was a great read and is one of my favorite Tana French books.
Fantastic book. Tana French is brilliant. Can't wait for the next one.
I've never read a murderer brought down in this way. Tana French is at the top of her game here. Can someone please double caffeinate her lattes--I need her to write more more more......
French is playing her strong suit here: pov of the woman detective. Loved it.
French does it again. Another fantastic mystery. 
I loved it. Definitely my favorite since In the Woods. I had a good idea of how it would turn out but was still a little surprised. In any case it was well done and very enjoyable.
"Antoinette Conway is the best narrator thus far. I have loved every book in this series, and The Trespasser did not let me down. Now, I can't wait for the next installment."
I really like Tana French. Excellent stories. 
This was the best book I've read this year.
Loved it. Couldn't put it down. 
I loved the story so artfully spun by Tana French. I have read all her books and so far this is my favorite I hated for it to end.
"Better than I expected

I was near giving up reading this, and so glad I hung in there, the last half was a lot harder to put down, complete page turner for me!"
Another fantastic book by Tana French. Could NOT put it down. Love this series.
One of my favorites of hers now. Can't wait for the next one!
I want to be inside tana french's mind. Geez. She's incredible.
Best of the Dublin Murder Squad series by far . . . LOVED it! 
"Another taut detective story by Tana French, where Detective Antoinette Conway is assigned a routine murder case which of course isn't routine .... I love Tana French's use of language. 4.5 stars."
Terrific return to form.
"Excellent, plot and character development. Highly recommend!"
Awesome!!
Tana French delivers another great mystery with fantastic characters as per usual!
"Riveting, superb."
"Perception and paranoia play a large part in being the only woman in the Murder Squad. Especially when this murder is different than the usual 'domestic'... great book. Oh, Tana, you are so good! "
This one might have been my favorite of the series.
My favorite detective writer because she is more than that.
Another terrific audiobook! 
"Wow, a page turner from start to finish. "
Tana French just gets better and better. This novel is one of her finest. I was hooked into the story from page one. Could not put it down. 
I like all her books so much. This was another impressively well written book. Conway and Moran are a great pair of murder detectives. Really hard to put this book down.
She is simply the best.
Incredible! Tana French weaves an amazing tale of intrigue with lots of character depth. This one is no exception.
"Another great one!

Tana French is a favorite of mine and this book was just as good as her others. I never know what's coming and worth every penny."
Kept me riveted till the end.
"Couldn't put it down, love her books. "
She's the greatest. As in stay up late and wake up early to read it great. 
Really really good. I loved it 
Love Tana French's style - lots of psychology underlying the work of her detectives. I like Antoinette as the lead character - hopefully she shows up as lead again. 
"Thoroughly enjoyed it

Just the right amount of detail and turns to the book. Multi dimensional lead character really well written novel top of the genre"
Best one yet. Intriguing until the end 
As good as it gets!
My favorite Tana French book yet!
I love Tana French development of her characters along with a good story
I think Tana French just keeps getting better. The characters are compelling probably because they are flawed human beings like we all are.
"I've enjoyed all of the Dublin Murder squad books, but so far this is my favorite."
"Great writing, sharp characters and a page turning story. Absolutely fantastic. The best Tana French novel yet."
Seriously one of the best Crime/MurderMysteries I have read in a long time. The characters are so engaging and the snappy way the detectives talk to each other had me hooked! Loved it! 
It's pretty much a given that I'll love a Tana French novel. This was no exception. Now I have to wait until a new one comes out! :(
"Superb. The story rattles along, sucks you in and takes you along for the journey. Cracking yarn!"
A thought-provoking page-turner - a real treat.
Edge of your seat murder mystery to be solved. 
Excellent read about an Irish female detective working among men. The murder and subsequent investigation had me reading non-stop to the end.
"I do love Tana French, and she was on a roll with this one. I had all kinds of things planned to do this sunny winter Saturday...and spent the time finishing the book."
"!!!!!!!!!!!

Also how do you pronounce Aislinn"
Another wonderful read from Tana French. She never disappoints!
"Great story!

Tana French always writes a complicated story with great characters. This doesn't disappoint. I love her flawed heroes and engrossing stories."
They just keep getting better and better.
"Best book I have read in 2016. Taut, literate, and engrossing. Read it. You'll love it. "
This is Tana French's best yet! What a great mystery writer.
Tana French writes great murder mysteries - dark as hell and pretty unpredictable. READ THEM.
This was one of my favorite of the 6.
One of the things I love about her books are the deeply flawed protagonists that we somehow manage to root for anyway. Another excellent book by French.
Excellent. I can't put them down. I am never disappointed.
I have enjoyed all her books. A great story teller. Her books can be read as stand alones and not formulaic. Fans will not be disappointed. 
"Solid

Steady pace..always hard to put down. Sometimes I get lost in the lingo but always a great read fr French."
"One of the finest crime authors around - I listened to this on audible and highly recommend it, the narrator's Irish accent made the story come to life. "
Brilliant. Better than A Secret Place and I thought that was excellent. 
This book may be my favorite of Tana's work. I can see it easily being made into a movie. It's the next Gone Girl
"Keeps you guessing, narrator was great on the audio."
By far my favorite Tana French book!
"French does crime fiction right. This is the fifth book by her I've read so far, and it's probably my favourite one yet. I'm looking forward to more."
I love Tana French's books!! When does the next one come out?!
"I didn't think I'd bond with prickly, defensive Antoinette, but somehow Tana French made me like just about everybody by the final chapter - including the murderer. Audiobook is beautifully done. "
This was a meaty read that I enjoyed taking my time savoring.
Typical Tana French book. I loved it.
"Very satisfying. Intricate plot, well executed. Well drawn, memorable characters."
"Tana Freanch is back, well she was never gone! Her writing is so compelling, this is another page turner!"
"Spectacular mystery! Hard to put it down, and never guessed how it would turn out. She just gets better and better with her stories."
She does not disappoint. Excellent read.
"A sharp procedural. Great narrator, voice, plotting, dialogue. It's my first Murder Squad book (a Book of the Month Club choice) but now I'll go back and read the other five. Recommended. "
I enjoy Tana French's writing style. This was a page turner for me. I stayed up later than I should have for a couple of nights because I could not put this down.
Excellent crime thriller. I was totally engrossed from beginning to end. Couldn't put it down
"Terrific escapist thriller

Perfect for a holiday read. A fresh voice and a keen, taut mystery.

Excellent in its portrayal of the social dynamics of the squad room."
Love this whole series. This one was especially great! Good characters. Intriguing mystery. 
Great read. Gripping murder mystery with lots of twists and interesting dynamics. Easy to get totally involved with. 
I love love love Tana French! This might be my favorite of her books now. Love Antoinette Conway and I really just want a series all about her.
Review to follow.
Couldn't read it fast enough! Very satisfying.
So much Tana French love! 
"Holy shit. Holy fucking shit. I thought that after five books, I had a few of French's usual tricks figured out. Some of them I did, but the ending of this book still blew me away. "
"Fantastic read!! Loved the slang, the twists, the throwing the ball for the dog...it adds an insider feel....best of all the murder story is tantalizing and curious and well played."
Tana French at her best-loved it
"Tana French just keeps getting better at character development, humor and story. Brilliant."
As with all her books to date- great. Once I start reading I know I will be doing nothing but reading until I finish. 
Love this series and this author
So well crafted. Had me guessing to the very end.
"One of my favourites of 2016, in the category 'Best Addictive, Beautifully-Written Thriller':
http://www.kirstylogan.com/best-books..."
"If you are not already reading her books, why not?"
"Absolutely love the Dublin Murder Squad series! Not just detective fiction, which is usually plot driven, these books are all about relationships & character development."
I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who loves a really good suspenseful book. It kept me on my toes with every chapter!!!! Tara French is a fantastic and amazing writer!!! 
Love these!
It's been a few years since I've stayed up late to finish a book...this one was worth it
One of her best
My least favorite part of all Tana French's books is when they end- and we have to wait years for the next one.
"I don't know how she does it. Every book of hers, I have been enthralled. This was no exception.
Great, great book."
many twists and turns in a seemingly simple murder case. First rate
Fantastic! A Christmas gift from Christopher. I would read Tana French's grocery lists.
Amazing audiobook read by Hilda Fay. 
Once again Tana French does not disappoint. I love the Dublin Murder Squad books and The Trespasser was no exception. 
TF gets better every book. The perfect crime novel!
Superior writing for the genre... so enjoyable
"Love love this author, she never disappoints. If you like murder mysteries her series is for you. I like the way she makes you get into the head of the protagonist."
Best one yet. 
Antoinette Conway is one of my favorite detectives on the Murder Squad!
"A mystery book that is 450 pages? What kind of mystery would take up that many words? The answer: a good one.

Now I want to read the rest of Tana French's novels."
"Definitely one of my new favorite authors. I would call this literary mystery. Loved the nuances, the way she got in the mind of the main character. Hard boiled, yet I cared for her. "
"Another great one from French. Twisty turny, complicated characters, a plot so twisted I was unable to figure it out... and then, once the truth is revealed, the suspense doesn't end!"
Very good book! My only complaint is it is too long. This is one of T F's best!
One of the finest fiction writers out there right now ... the fact that she writes mystery is a bonus ....
Favorite book so far from my favorite author.
This is the second book I've read by this author. This thriller will keep you glued to the pages. I loved it!
Outstanding! Hope more books with Detective Antoinette to follow.
Another winner by Tana French. She never disappoints.
"I love Tana French, I love the Dublin Murder Squad, and I loved this book more than any of the others that came before. I wish Tana published a new one every month."
"I am a big fan of Tana French. This is her best yet, and that's saying something! The characters are complex, real and engaging. The dialogue crackles. The plot captivating."
"One of my favorites of all the Tana French Murder Squad books. Female Detective, excellent story."
"My new favorite of this series - I liked Conway's POV in this, with some real character growth and discovery. Excellent plotting."
Wonderful mystery
I've read all of Tana French's Dublin novels. Fun reading.
The Trespasser is great. Nuanced layers and beautiful writing. I hope we get to see more of Conway. Now I really need Tana French to hurry up and write her next book.
Loved it!!! One of her best! 
"I really enjoyed this one. Had me in circles, which is entertaining."
Tana French continues to engage me. Another enthralling book from her. 
I had the audiobook version which was excellent. 
Tana French is everything. And I need a new one now. 
Wow. My favorite one since In the Woods. Had a really hard time putting this one down. I think I could read several more books about this partnership.
"Very good writing and a great story, strongly recommend"
"Listen to this one on tape - it’s FABULOUS! A good read anyway, but the Irish lilt is mesmerizing!"
Accidentally read this first in the series but it doesn’t matter and it was so good!!
LISTENED TO AUDIO BOOK: RIVETING AND BRILLIANT!
"Refreshingly enjoyable: Well written, rich characters; the story took its time to unwind and had a satisfying conclusion. The excellent reader was a bonus."
"I loved this one... its tied with The Likeness & Faithful Place. I hope there will be more of this series...I'll be faithfully waiting for it.
"
Good as all other books in the series.
This is a re-read.
Tana French never disapponts.
Very involved story. Perhaps her best yet.
WOW! Total treat. My first T. French. Won’t be my last!
The audiobook read by Hilda Fay is tremendous.
"Slow burn! Builds tension, keeps you guessing. Then gives you completion, (which I like)."
Slow start but very good. 
Tana French is perfect 
"Dios, qué bueno.
Primer libro que leo de Tana French y lo que más me alegra es saber que hay muchos otros esperándome."
When I’m reading a Tana French book…nothing else matters.
"Just did a re-read, and I had to up my rating."
"This book was accidentally mailed to me -- sender unknown. It was AMAZING! I'm sorry to whomever was supposed to receive this book, but it's definitely worth the read. "
The BEST of all French's book - and I love them all.
Loved the characters and their development. 
Apparently one can be consistently flawless six times in a row.
So good I want to re-read all the other Murder Squad books. 
"Ten stars. TEN STARS! My favorite book of the series, my favorite book of the year...stunning. "
"Tana French is one of those authors you stumble upon and (after finishing one of her books) are amazed that you've never heard of her before, because she's just so damn good at what she does. Her characters are flawed and fascinating and you get so deep in their minds that what they feel, you feel. The murders leave you guessing and trying to figure it out and every time you think you've got it sussed you realize that you're entirely wrong.

My only complaint? She doesn't write fast enough!"
Outstanding book !! Well written mystery. Great characters.
Another great one from Tana French!
Tana French's best so far! Must read!
Perfect mystery. Amazing prose and dialogue. All around spectacular novel 
Antoinette Conway is a love/hate relationship for me.
"Brilliant. Last third of the book, I didn't take a breath. I am wrung out."
Fabulous characters and pretty good story. A real web with subtle surprises. Characters. 
Favorite so far.
"As a lover of crime fiction, this was fantastic. The writing was good, the characters were well-developed, the plot was strong but not trying to shock you. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading the other books in this series."
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!
"Her best so far

The ""who dunnit?"" is excellent, but the real story is Antoinette's battles - the one between her and her Murder Squad male ""colleagues"" and the one within, the one that has her questioning her identity and future as a Detective. Enjoy the murder mystery and the Murder mystery. A little heavy on metaphors at times, but very, very well-written."
Loved it. By far her best book yet. Keeps you engaged all the way to the end. Looking forward to the next one already. This isn't one you'll figure out 10 pages in.
Tana French gets better with each new work. Brilliant.
Wow! Simply amazing. The Secret Place was my favorite Tana French book when I start reading The Trespasser. That changed somewhere around the halfway point. She just grabs you and twists you up and you end up feeling all kinds of intense emotions that don't let you put the book down until you're done. Definitely worth the read!
I love this series. The characters continue from book to book with a different perspective each time. I especially enjoy the psychological twists. This was the first time I tried the audio version. I enjoyed listening to the Dublin accent. It was performed well. 
"Great read

Gritty detective case solving strategies. Lots of twists and turns will keep you turning pages. 2 day read for sure."
"Tana French gets better with each new novel. Her books are connected but not sequels. A different character takes center stage each time which keeps the intrigue fresh. Her characters and plot ring true-life is very complicated and the path from start to finish is never a straight line.

As Antoinette works her way through what seems like a routine domestic, her paranoia over her place in the murder squad clashes with her instincts as a detective. Just how much will she get in her own way as she tries to avoid being manipulated by more experienced squad members who may, or may not, have something to hide.
The clues are there but where is the truth?
Definite page turner!"
"It was great being back in Dublin through the pages of The Trespasser by Tana French. I relished the terminology and could almost hear the different accents as well as feel the mists. At the story's heart is the double mystery of who murdered the young woman and who is trying to get rid of the female detective.
The Trespasser is a fast read."
Tana French is one of my favorite authors and this book did not let me down. 
Least depressing of her novels so far.
Another wonderful book by French featuring Conway and Moran and the D squad. 
"This might be my favorite of all her previous mysteries.
"
I had forgotten how much I like Tana French.
I really quite enjoyed this and I reccomend listening to the audio because the narrator is very good. -P
"I am wrung out. French is so good at this. I hate the foul language, sexual garbage vocabulary, but she can really write a taut, believable, intense police story."
"EXCELLENT Book... Absolutely deserved being on the ""10 Best"" lists from NYTImes"
"Another one hit out of the park by Tana French! This one pairs the same two Ds from ""The Secret Place"": Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran. I particularly liked this book because it was pretty tight. Action takes place within a week. French does a terrific job fleshing out all the Ds but esp Conway and Moran. As with previous books, this one felt genuine - plot was focused - nothing and no one unnecessary to the story.

I'll read anything this woman writes."
I always love Tana French's books and I loved this one too. I always feel I really get to know her characters and I want more stories about them. I can't wait for her next book already!
"If you like murder investigations where the police detectives are more interesting than the victim or the murderer, Tana French is your girl!
"
"I love the Murder Squad. No matter what kind of murder we're talking about, these books are always a about the detective's need for connection with others. Because the main characters keep changing in the series, this set up never gets old. And the bad guys are usually pretty tortured types in these books, too.

Loved Antoinette."
"Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way. Tana French is such a good writer and her characters keep you on your toes wondering....
If you are a fan, this is a must read."
"The Trespasser is a a fast-faced, thrill-ride of a book--I couldn't put it down. While the twists and turns were as exciting as a Jason Stratham movie, there was also real depth and complexity to the intrigue.

Antoinette Conway, the protagonist, is written from a first-person point of view. She's a young murder detective, assigned to lead a significant investigation for the first time. The reader shares her thought processes, her discoveries, and her insecurities as she races to find out who killed a beautiful young woman just beginning her adult life.

The victim's romantic interest emerges as the most likely suspect, and the pressure is on to close the case quickly. As tension increases, Conway and her partner Moran get the uneasy suspicion that the case is more involved than it appears on the surface. Between hazing from the all-male murder squad, unwelcome publicity from local press, and unrelenting pressure, Conway begins to feel that there's a conspiracy to make this her last case.

Conway's character evolves throughout the novel as she uncovers surprises that mirror her self-discovery. The relationship between Conway and her partner, Moran, is tested and pushed to the limit. And it's all woven into a non-stop plot of twists and turns, ups and downs that will leave you breathless and wondering. Really a great book!!!!"
"Love love love! So sad to have finished all six of these and looking forward to another soon!
"
Slow but worth it. 
"Hilda Fay reads this story-upon-fable-upon-fairytale-upon psychological thriller so beautifully I felt caught in the grip of French's Irish storytelling skills after hearing just the prologue. Seldom have I listened to a book hour after hour, day after day as I did this one. Antionette Conway narrates and she gets a lot of self-discovery accomplished along with the unmasking of the villain that she and her partner from The Secret Place, Steve Moran, manage to accomplish. Whether the killer will actually be publicly exposed is just one of the questions they face. The various trespasses of morality, ethics, law, and sensible comprehension of reality that many of the characters commit makes me wonder which one French had in mind when she chose the title. A second hearing of the prologue moves one of them to the top of the list. Splendid."
"Wonderful Tangle of What Ifs

Oh my goodness! This story really swept me down a rabbit hole and I loved it! If you like a good ""who dun it"" book, this is a real treat!"
"Tana French is one of the very best at what she does. Her stories are all set in Ireland, all involve the Dublin Murder Squad. She keeps the reader in suspense until the very end. I am always trying to guess ""who done it""? With her novels I have never once guessed correctly. She surrounds each character with scenery making the character real to the point that you think it is reality versus a story. Love this novel. Can't wait for the author's next one."
No real need to add my voice to the chorus of those who think Tara French is just the greatest!
Amazing. I'm going to buy a copy of this book and mark it up all over - she does such terrific physical reactions and tension for all her characters. Loved it. 
"This murder mystery was one of the best I've read and I don't usually like this genre. The story telling was compelling and in the audio version, the narrator speaking in an Irish Brogue was so good she practically acted out the parts. This was thoroughly entertaining, I couldn't wait to get into my car in and out of work in order to hear what happens next. Highly recommended. "
"Love all her books though I was not happy with The Likeness as I found is completely implausible. Until this book Faithful Place was my favorite, but this is the best of them all. Riveting and satisfying. Can't wait for No. 7 in the series. "
I love a good mystery and this had all the elements I needed to fall in love. Tana French has a beautiful writing style and a unique way of describing situations. Loved every twist and turn
This was a great mystery and read by an amazing Irish reader.
"Okay – so, for the first 7-10 chapters, I saw this novel as a bit of a letdown; not spectacular relative to the rest of the series. The plot seemed passive, and Conway – being blunt and scrubbed too tough as a result the way her childhood (and discrimination throughout adulthood, I guess) manifested with her – was probably my least favourite narrator of the series. Don't get me wrong – she was brilliantly savage at times, but in terms of emotional impact through introspection and overall characterization which Tana usually delivers brilliantly, it was (at that stage) just not up to par. The overall direction of the story seemed a little burnt out and frayed; even though my mind was completely open to and aware of the possibility of a big Tana shake-up, I honestly couldn't see anything execptionally juicy or powerful coming out of this.

BUT, at some time past halfway (which many, understandably, would deem too far along), the plot started subtly accelerating, not-so-subtly bouncing around and deceptively solidifying, and it was SO WORTH IT. Tana took her goddamn time, but she came through. That first moment of realization (for the lack of a better term) was only a taster of what the story was to amount to. The first novel of the series, ‘In the Woods,’ really gave me a wake-up call regarding deception, but apparently there were people who saw the outcome coming. No one could have foreseen the ending of this story. It literally went from Tana’s-most-passive-plot-yet to Tana’s-best-fucking-plot-twists-to-date.

The last third contained some of her most adrenaline-spiking writing. I'll always be more of a sucker for her emotionally raw introspection and poetic imagery, but I was on the edge on my seat during some of the interrogations & epiphanies & climatic moments. It was heavy crime fiction. Razor-cut. Dangerously fierce. I needed to have a couple of lie-downs. This was pure hard power.

The whole semi-focus upon imagination & fantasizing also turned out to be a really powerful theme. The contrast between Ryan/Aislynn (and even Steve) blatantly getting caught up in their heads, and Conway underlying getting caught up in hers – all to their own demise in one way or another – was really well presented. The characterization rung deep; it was where a lot of the emotional resonance lay.

Expanding on Conway, her mindset throughout the case went from vague yet guarded to absolutely set on a prospect, with now an even larger dosage of paranoia regarding someone close to her. Then she’d accumulate a few key facts and – boom – out of the water; new focus; new person/people to worry about. It was character-rooted deception in a different flavour to ITW. We were being thrown around with Conway; experiencing her borderline mental breakdown as the paranoia and over-analysis closed in around her. The fatal flaw of being pre-disposed to seeing the malicious intent of a person foremost is a bit of a common theme, but the way it was presented here was in no way basic or typical. Conway's epiphanies always seemed like the real deal.

In short, Tana French left me shook as usual."
A great entry into one of the best mystery series being written today
"This is probably my favorite Tana French novel. I could not put it down. When it got to the ending and you know what happened, it kinda gets long in the unfolding."
Love reading Tana French!
This kept me up into wee hours of night and I reread the ending in the morning I liked it so much. Will read all of her books. 
"Big Tana French fan here, but I think this was one of my favorites. The murder case itself wasn't perfectly air tight since for plot purposes, seemingly brilliant detectives suddenly fail to pursue obvious lines of questioning, but I don't care because it's rich and complex and layered. I love how French writes character sketches with such casual, compact strokes of the pen. And I love the unfussy treatment of gender dynamics. This one isn't quite as estrogen-drenched as the last one set in a girls' boarding school but it still takes on the gender stuff that goes down in a male-dominated field with exquisite attention to individual psychology, which is so often left out of these portrayals. Devoted Tana French fan, out."
Loved it! Great vacation read. 
I really really really enjoyed this book!! Detective Moran kinda grew to me after this story. Still don't really like Conway. That lady has an attitude!!! Looking forward where the Dublin Murder Squad goes after this! And still.. BRING BACK ROB RYAN <3 
"Great read. Narrator is a tad annoying with her paranoia but when you realise how integral to the story that is, it leads to a unputdownable read."
"Really enjoyed this. Always really enjoy Tana French's books and this was no exception. Great mystery, kept me guessing. Enjoyed the story-telling. "
I am really bummed that I have finished all the books the author has written for the Dublin Murder Squad series. I love Tana French's writing. 
5 stars
"This is the first book of the series that I have read. This was a Book of the Month option that drew me in because I enjoy mysteries and have studied abroad in Dublin (series is ""Dublin Murder Squad"").

Conway is a great female lead - this novel is more about characterization versus physical action or intimacy. Conway is a very interesting character because of her attitude toward the squad that is rooted in some very vicious ""pranks,"" because she is a woman of mixed race on a team of men.

I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more form the series."
"This is a police procedural that keeps you guessing—both about who done it and how it's finally going to be revealed—until the last half hour of a 20-hour listen. Better than that, though, is that the journey is worth it. You're not just twiddling your thumbs for 19.5 hours waiting for the big reveal. I actually kind of didn't want to know who and how we'd find out because I was enjoying the process of getting there so much. The extended dialogue scenes (usually interrogations) were utterly absorbing; I felt right there in the interview room with the characters. The ending was also extremely satisfying, demonstrating that the story—and people involved—really were as complex as they seemed (and as real people are). I don't know about any of French's other books, but this one is smart and rich, and a highly rewarding listen."
Her best so far.
"It's a good thing Tana French is a slow writer or I'd never get anything done. Honestly, I can't remember the last time a burned the midnight oil and shirked my job because I couldn't put a book down. I loved the characters and the mystery and being in Detective Antoinette Conway's head was a trip. But all of Tana French's book are like this for me. She had me from the first page right up until the last. And if you haven't read any of her books, the fact that the stories take place in Ireland is just the frosting on the cake. "
Loved this addition to Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series!
How does this writer get so much detail of how the Dublin police department works? Amazing. I love the descriptions of places in Dublin and the unique Irish phrasing. I can almost hear the accents. These books would be great to hear recorded by Irish actors to get the full atmosphere of place.
"I listened to the audio version of this book. The author and the reader are both absolutely fabulous. Tana French develops intricate and intriguing plots. In this story a woman is the ""D"" (detective) in Dublin who is unraveling the story of a murder of a young woman who she can relate to more than she wants to. This story is extremely well thought out and compelling. I highly recommend it."
"The best of her writing so far! Interesting characters, with the lead engaging. The story, which over focused on the main characters inner thoughts, didn't get bogged down by them. This story moved along. long but engaging."
"Maybe my favorite Tana French novel. The plot is great but I had to slow down to enjoy the writing. Written in the first person of the murder detective Antoinette Conway, she is perfectly shown as who is (tough), and some of the writing had me laughing out loud. It is amazing how Tana French can show the personality of the character by the way she writes them (""me and Steve....). I hope her books get made into movies. I give it a 12 out of 10. "
"I read a Tana French book and know by this point to look for a few things.
(1) The mystery that won't get solved
(2) The beautiful interpersonal relationship that will get destroyed
(3) Someone's career that will end, and
(4) How she'll completely twist those expectations in ways you couldn't expect.

She's wonderfully non-formulaically formulaic. I can't get enough of her writing-how she draws out a single conversation for pages in breathtaking detail, how she adds humor where it's most needed, how she build such complex and relatable, fucked-up characters."
Loved this - real page turner!!
Tana French and the Dublin Murder Squad never disappoint. The Trespasser kept me turning pages and anxious to see what was going to happen next. 
"When Tana French created Antionette Conway, she hit it out of the park. Conway is so pure, all Dublin cop with an extra scoop of like-I-give-a-shit on top. She never wavers, never goes out of character. I loved picking up this book just to see what she was going to do next, and who she was going to do it to. The story is a mess - not from a story arc perspective, but from a real life one. It digs into some awful stuff and serves it up as only French can - with clarity that hits the reader like a hammer. One thing I don't think I'll ever accuse French of is subtlety. No spoilers here, so that's it. Buy the book and get ready for a ride."
I really enjoyed this book! Looking forward to whatever Tana publishes next.
Tana French is a dangerous drug. Don't put the kettle on when you open this book. The house will go down in flames around you while you turn the next page.
"Excellent story, plot twists and red herrings. Loved this.
"
Love Tana French's series! Her writing keeps you sitting on the edge of the seat until you find out who done it!
