"Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"

"This is not my favorite Tana French book. In The Trespasser, Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are assigned what they think is a run-of-the-mill domestic dispute gone horribly awry. After all, there is no forced entry and they know that she was meeting a date that night. They do think there is something suspicious about the way Detective Breslin wants them to arrest the boyfriend ASAP, but despite his hurry, they do their best to look into the few things at odds with making this an open and shut case.

The problem with this book, unlike other French’s novels, is that because the lead detectives think this is boring and run-of-the-mill, and because things don’t really start unraveling until the last one hundred pages or so, it’s also kind of run-of-the-mill and boring for us, the readers. Also, the writing isn’t the high-literary quality of her other books.

This is still well written and it will keep you turning pages, it’s just not her best work. Start with her novels in the Murder Squad series 1-5, like Into the Woods or The Secret Place.

This is book six in Tana French's 'Murder Squad Series' but can easily be read as a standalone.

As the story opens, a glamorous young woman named Aislinn Murray is found dead in her house and - since it appears to be a domestic dispute - the investigation is assigned to Murder Squad newbies - Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran.




Conway is the only woman on the squad and has been having a rough time with the guys, replete with disrespectful behavior, practical jokes, swiped case files, etc. Conway is determined to show her mettle so she's especially irked when senior investigator Breslin is assigned to 'help with' the case.




When Conway and Moran talk to Aislinn's friend Lucy, they're told the dead woman has been dating a bookstore owner named Rory Fallon. According to Lucy, Aislinn liked Rory but made it a point to play 'hard to get.'




The detectives also learn that Aislinn's father vanished years ago, never to be heard from again. His unsolved disappearance shattered Aislinn and her mother, and changed the course of their lives. Moreover it was only a couple of years ago - after her mother died - that Aislinn dieted, got a makeover, bought new clothes, and transformed herself into a beauty.




The detectives question Aislinn's boyfriend Rory, and the bookstore owner admits he was invited to dinner at Aislinn's on the night of the murder. He says he arrived right on time but Aislinn didn't answer the door or respond to his texts. Because Rory acts squirrelly during the interview he becomes the number one suspect. Still, Conway and Moran aren't sure Rory's guilty and want to investigate further.




Breslin, on the other hand, pressures the duo to arrest Rory and close the case.....to get kudos for the Murder Squad.

Conway and Moran continue their inquiries and get a whiff of another boyfriend in Aislinn's life, a mysterious man who might be a gangster. The partners also get the feeling that certain members of the Murder Squad are trying to derail the investigation.




Could there be corruption in police ranks? Maybe even gang ties? The partners plan to find out.

Most of the action in the book revolves around questioning witnesses. There are long interrogation scenes during which the police use various strategies to get the witnesses and suspects off-balance and talking. These techniques - especially those devised by Conway - are described in great detail.




There's a good bit of suspense as Conway and Moran try to find Aislinn's killer.....and events take some unexpected turns.

I like Tana French's books but this wasn't one of my favorites. For me the numerous extended interrogation scenes became tiresome. I also found the atmosphere in the Murder Squad troubling, with the male detectives hassling Conway: spitting in her coffee, peeing in her locker, stealing her witness statements, etc.




This kind of thing is unacceptable and Conway should have done something about it.....especially since she's pretty badass in other areas of her life. I was happy, at least, that Conway didn't buckle to pressure from Detective Breslin.

Overall, this is a good story that leads to a satisfactory climax. I'd recommend the book to mystery readers, especially fans of the Murder Squad series.

"The Peine Forte et Dure of Detective Procedural Thrillers
Engagingly claustrophobic

As all Tana French ""Dublin Murder Squad"" novels, this one engages the reader with an interesting crime to solve. An early 20-something lady is found in her apartment with the back of her head crushed. Antoinette Conway is effectively the lead detective here, but she faces a Squad room full of men who are pushing just short of the line of sexual harassment and a boss is threatening to take over this case because it's open and shut.

The intensity wanes as the detectives go down a number of rabbit holes. While the story builds back a little momentum toward the end, French muddies it up with an ending to a seemingly untethered backstory, or subplot for Conway. Perhaps it was just me, but the novel seemed to spend considerably more time than what I'd consider normal in the interrogation room; it felt like 90-95% of my reading of the novel was spent within those 4 walls. That's not to say the interrogation scenes weren't tense or realistic (they were), it's just that I felt claustrophobic, seriously, when I finished reading this rather lengthy novel."
"French won me over with her five star writing in her debut police-procedural eleven years ago, and the gorgeousness in her character development has deepened with each of her books over the years. Here's a snippet from said debut - and imagine how much she has honed her craft since. She is VERY good.

“The wood is all flicker and murmur and illusion. Its silence is a pointillist conspiracy of a million tiny noises— rustles, flurries, nameless truncated shrieks; its emptiness teems with secret life, scurrying just beyond the corner of your eye. Careful: bees zip in and out of cracks in the leaning oak; stop to turn any stone and strange larvae will wriggle irritably, while an earnest thread of ants twines up your ankle.”

One thing that is interesting in her books - and unless you've read all of them as I have, it's not apparent - is the sense of place she writes. French is an American who moved to Ireland, and I think that 'outsider' status, even decades after she's lived there, has made her a really good observer of neighborhoods, schools, various settings. When she describes the offices of the murder squad detectives, I still get a thrill that they are housed in a castle. A castle! Whether it is blustery moors or half-built upscale, generic subdivisions, perhaps a boarding school’s grounds that feel like they’ve been groomed by Hagrid while Hermione and Ron and Harry keep secrets - all of these exist in the Ireland written of by Tana French. But she so gloriously conveys them to us that they are alive in our minds as well.

Likewise, the interior setting - if that even is a thing - is atmospheric as well. As we ride along on the shoulders of each story's protagonist detective (and his or her partner), the author always parallels the inner hang-ups or memories of said good-guy-cop with others in the story. We get to traipse around in the mind of the lead detective, not necessarily tied to his/her invetigation, but in experiencing whatever soft spots or sore spots the reader can relate to. We may not like the protagonist, but we will end up feeling that we know him.

Unfortunately for me, this story had two absurd plot points that tested believability and bothered me. One of her early novels was about a female murder detective who so closely resembled a murder victim that she successfully moved into the dead girls home and lived with her roommates for months, with none of them knowing that she was an imposter. Really??

Here, the incredulity was not as silly, but the drawn out story line and the anticlimactic ending brought what started as a five star ride into just a middling reading experience.

If you've never read Tana French, I would likely skip this one and the other entitled The Likeness. All her others are beautiful and addictive. Be sure to notice her settings. Many of these neighborhoods are not going to be on your bucket list of places to visit while in Ireland, but are absolutely real.

Will I read her next one due out this fall? Absolutely. But itll be on loan from the library."
"I was not familiar with this author but saw good ratings on both Amazon and Goodreads so I placed a hold request for this book at my local library. When I first started reading this book I was having difficulty getting into it. It was full of slang and expressions which I was not familiar with. Gaff? Gaffe? Jack? Kip? There was no glossary or introduction that helped explain these and I was left to try and understand by the context in which they were being used. As my reading progressed the experience and appreciation for the story increased. I still think it would have been helpful if there had been some place in the book where there was an explanation of these expressions for those of us who never lived in Ireland. For instance when one character tells another character who has pulled a double shift to get some kip I am assuming that means to get some sleep but this is just one example where I was left to guess.

This is number six in the Dublin Murder Squad series but I don't think it is necessary to have read the previous books in the series. Antoinette Conway is a detective on the Murder Squad but it is not the dream job she had expected. Working night shift, being assigned endless thankless cases involving drunks and domestic disputes, being harassed and a victim of vicious pranks she is reaching the breaking point and is considering pulling the plug. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems to appreciate her and is glad she is part of the squad.

Antoinette and Stephen are just finishing up another night shift when their boss hands them a new case. Aislinn Murray is found dead in her home next to a table set for a romantic dinner. At first it appears to be another lovers quarrel. Other detectives on the squad are pushing for Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend. Pushing hard to make the arrest and wrap up this case. But Antoinette believes she has seen Aislinn somewhere before and the more they investigate the questions about Aislinn increase. She is not the Barbie doll she appeared to be and her friend hints she was in danger. Antoinette has become increasingly paranoid thanks to the harassment and pranks and she is not sure whether this case is part of the campaign to force her off the squad, if Aislinn was involved in something that resulted in her death, or if it is just another lovers quarrel turned deadly.

It was hard to connect with any of the characters in this story. None of them were very likable. Not even the lead character in the story, Antoinette Conway. She apparently did not have an easy time growing up but as an adult has a bad attitude and does not get along with people very well. At times not even her partner who may be the only person on the squad on her side. She apparently has some mates and has been known to go out for a pint with them but not in this story. She is not the most unlikable person on the Murder Squad but then there really isn't a single character on the squad who is. I would give this series another try but hopefully the characters are somewhat more likable."
"After reading Tana French’s The Secret Place , the fifth in her Dublin Murder Squad series, a book I liked but didn’t love, I was hoping for a strong finish. The Trespasser featured the same two detectives, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran. This pair is as different as night and day, but strangely, they work well as a team – for the most part. Do they drive each other crazy at times? Oh, yeah!

They drove me crazy as well. Steve, a newcomer to the squad, is obsessed with theories, thinking that is what makes a good detective. Okay, fine. Only he doesn’t know when to say when. Antoinette is the office pariah. It’s not just because she’s the only female, nor is it only because she is also fairly new to the division. These things are part of it, yes. However, Conway has a gigantic chip – make that a tree trunk – on her young shoulders. She’s abrasive, and she knows it. She’s tough. She’s also smart and a good cop.

The duo are working the night shift are about to wrap things up when they are assigned to an apparent domestic call. What they find is anything but a run-of-the-mill domestic skirmish. It turns out to be the first big case for this pair. Will they do everything right and have their first big solve?

A suspect quickly emerges, but all the evidence is circumstantial. In their zeal to find collaborating evidence, Moran and Conway go out far and wide interviewing everyone they can find who had anything to do with the victim and their chief suspect. Steve’s imagination runs wild with his conspiracy theory. When that doesn’t hold water, it’s back to square one.

As with other books in this series, the plot plods along. This one plods even more slowly than the others, it seems. The interrogation scenes are fine, as the detectives, with even the enigmatic Detective Breslin adding some kick, but for the most part, things dragged too much for me. At about the halfway mark I was ready to call it quits, but I stuck with it. The last 20% finally caught my interest, as the interactions among the principals gets intense. Who did what? I thought I knew, but at that point, I stopped trying to guess and just kept on reading. Those who love police procedurals and the give-take/push-shove of investigations might love this one. Me – not so much.

I think the main issue I had was that I really didn’t enjoy the characters all that much. There was no one to really root for. As I learned more about the victim, I didn’t even care that much about her. I was sorry to see the series end on this note, but all in all, this book did not meet my expectations.

2.5 rounded to 3 stars"
"Ahhhh....this one was a bit of a disappointment, after having read the previous books in the series. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as interesting or intense as the others. Glad I finished the series, though. I will continue to read the Dublin Murder Squad books if any more are published."
Three stars is generous. So long for so little.
"Queue the unpopular review...

The New York Times calls The Trespasser a ""tour de force.""
Me: Much more tour de forced.

French’s writing remains exceptional but The Trespasser is her weakest novel to date. TT features, Antionette Conway and Steve Moran, the lead detectives in her much better The Secret Place. I didn’t like either character in this novel—in fact, I disliked most everyone in this novel except Rory and the Chief. From less than half way through I was rooting for Moran to solve the case and for the B to everyone Conway to get tossed. Not a great place to start.

Can one dislike the characters in a novel and still like the book? Yes! French’s own Faithful Place is an example. Frank Mackey is hard to like but FP is terrific. Conway on the other hand killed TT for me. I don't remember her from TSP being as wired as she is in TT. In TSP she struck me as tough, smart and assured. In this one, she's a lit fuse of anger and paranoia. Conway the 1st would have handled the issues driving Conway the 2nd crazy much better. Conway the 1st would have addressed harassment in the squad room head on, with a punch to someone’s face, vs the woe is me paranoia of Conway the 2nd. And TT would have been much better for it. I also don't recall Steve Moran in TSP being the smiley, be friends with everyone puppy he is in TT. I remember him as more quietly ingratiating and a bit unsure. I would re-read TSP, but don’t want my distaste of Conway from this book to seep into what I remember as an excellent read. As for O'Kelly, Breslin, and McCann, all three read like stock characters from every police procedural ever written, O'Kelly, the gruff boss, Breslin the smarmy peacock, McCann, the downtrodden vet. I expect better from French.

The mystery? It wasn’t that interesting; obvious where it was headed from about half way through. Also clear: who was involved in the murder (and who not), and the role every character would play in the reveal. French's normally intricate plotting is forced in TT. Regrettably so.

On my buy, borrow, skip scale: I cannot believe I’m saying this because I adore French’s writing, but The Trespasser is a weak borrow at best, perhaps a skip. Four stars for the writing, two for the story, net three. Read instead French’s excellent The Likeness, The Secret Place or Faithful Place."
"First of all I must admit I love Tana French's novels. Her writing is astounding. However, out of the six Dublin Murder Squad novels, in my opinion, The Trespasser is the weak link. As with all her novels, the story started out with a bang, and I was so excited to keep reading. What I read was about three hundred pages of Irish witty banter, which French does ever so well, but after a while I got a bit bored of it. This story was much more about the politics of police squads, interpersonal communications, abandonment and loss than it was about solving a murder, and making the story interesting. Again, just my take on it. The last fifty pages were terrific, and I longed to read more, hear how it all played out. I highly recommend any of French's other novels. This was, for me, a bit of a disappointment."
"Tiene sus momentos, sobre todo en los interrogatorios, y también bastante humor negro pero se me ha hecho un poco largo y pesado."
"Honestly, pretty underwhelming reveal because of my high expectations and the repetitive conversations in the first half. Not much happens and I don't just mean crime action, but action at all. There's more interior monologue in Antoinette's head then real plot action going on, I think. The dialogues are whip smart though, Tana French never disappoints with that!"
"I love Tana French but this was my least favorite book by her. I felt the plot was too busy with too much brainstorming by Antoinette and Steve....all over the place, it kept me switching back and forth, trying to follow their line of thinking. Maybe I'm just not a die-hard ""police procedural"" girl, but it felt like too much to me.

Toward the last couple chapters of the book it started really picking up momentum and I actually lost myself in the final pages (which I wish would have happened during the first FOUR HUNDRED PAGES.....)

It was a good ending and one that I was hoping would be satifsying, considering I gave the book a difficult and LONG whole week to get through. Overall, I could only give a three star review on this for the reasons mentioned above.

If you want to read the best of Tana French, try her earlier books. To me, THE TRESPASSER seemed like a book that she threw together to meet a quota or something ~ albeit with more details (and length) than I could keep up with after awhile.

Sorry, Tana... I will still definitely read you next book....hopefully it will grab me like the earlier ones and hold me all the way through!"
"I have mixed feelings about Tana French's work, as always. Her writing style is excellent and engaging, no doubt about that. But it is too long, too many conversations and way too many ""ifs"", ""what-ifs"", ""maybes"" and ""probably-s"", without any hard evidence.
"
"Tana French is one of my favorite authors. To date, all six of her books have been different. Instead of a formulaic approach to the Dublin Murder Squad, each has had its own unique world and feel. And the solve of the case is usually the least enthralling part of the read. 
In The Trespasser, the solve IS the book.

Up until the last third of the book, it was an endless loop of what if's and no evidence or break throughs. Along with this is Detective Antoinette Conway's crippling self-sabotage as she imagines the entire force is against her and looking for a way to boot her from the department.

It isn't until the last third of the book that we get any answers and therefore start to get somewhere with the story. It was a pretty great final stretch; I only wish it had started sooner. French usually has great pacing in her book, so I'm not sure why most of this one was stalled out.

Hopefully those that start the book will actually finish it. The payoff is worth it.
3.5 stars"
"3.5 stars.
I have read all the Tana French's Murder Squad series. Was very disappointed in her previous book, The Secret Place, but loved In the Woods which was her first book, and enjoyed Broken Harbor. Each book can be read a stand-alone, as separate books feature a supporting character from an earlier book and we see a new crime case through their eyes.

Her books stand out, both being detailed police procedurals and in depth character studies. These books are well crafted and belong to the small category of literary/mystery fiction. Tough, harsh dialogue is mixed with vivid descriptive passages, and sudden bursts of enthralling lyricism.

We see the case through the eyes of Antoinette Conway, the main detective involved. She has been subjected to harassment, mean pranks, insults and part of her report gone missing. She is tough, relentless, intelligent, and can be harsh and insulting with fellow workers and others. She lacks friends and does not appear to care, but underneath is quite vulnerable. She is starting to show signs of paranoia. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only member of the department who seems to like her, or at least tolerate her. They have a good working relationship. He is new to the squad, well liked, cheerful and optimistic, and able to handle Antoinette's anger. She has always been assigned to the most routine domestic cases and dreams of working on more challenging crime cases.

Her present case involves a beautiful, stylish woman found dead in her catalogue perfect residence. Antoinette's bosses are pushing her and partner to rush in arresting and charging the woman's boyfriend for murder. She feels she has seen the woman somewhere before, but can't recall the circumstances. She and partner begin looking for other suspects and motives, searching for more complications than more senior police are demanding. She fears that their goal is to force her off the murder squad.

There is much dialogue as they interview the prime suspect and friends and acquaintances of the deceased as well as people who may have witnessed something. Although essential to the character study, I found this lead to a slow reading experience.



"
"Consider this a review on a curve - a harder-than-normal curve - because Tana French is excellent, among the best contemporary crime writers around. Maybe the best on a sentence-by-sentence basis. And as a rule she puts compelling characters in strange, almost mystical stories.

So three stars for The Trespasser is four for anyone else. Still, the novel doesn't quite measure up to her best work. The main character is difficult to like, but not in a compelling way - she's a fine detective, but a bit of a martyr, and her character stays more or less static until the very end. TP feels like a more standard police procedural than French's other books - no swooping time shifts, no haunted houses in the countryside, just lots of time in the interview room. Worst of all, I had a pretty good guess at the killer very early on, which did slightly take away my enjoyment. And at the end, there's no real brilliant solve - French's detective gets the backstory between the killer and victim from a third person, and then the killer doesn't confess, and then he does.

Still enjoyed it, still glad I read it, but don't make it your first Tana French."
"I'm a huge TF fan, but this is not her best. The last third is good, and the ending is brilliant, but the first two-thirds are a slog. It's just not fun being inside the head of such an angry and paranoid character who's tied up in knots over squad politics/enemies, and it's a little too convenient to have one person who ends up explaining a big part of the solution. Still, I'm ready for whatever French writes next. :-)"
mix feeling. i did not enjoyed it much. i found the beginning legging and a lot of only talking and chewing the same ideas over and over.
"Gosto muito da autora, gosto muito dos cenários que habitualmente cria e da dinâmica dos seus personagens, a forma como Tana French escreve sobre a realidade de uma esquadra, das particularidades e idiossincrasias que se estabelecem entre parceiros de equipa de investigação são notáveis, no entanto, neste Intruso desta vez a história não resultou para mim. A personagem principal é excessiva em tudo e se por um lado o seu arco de história é interessante, temos numa Irlanda branca uma investigadora mulher, a única no departamento de homicídios ao qual juntamos o facto de ser uma mulher de cor, só poderia dar um enredo interessante pois queremos que ela seja a super mulher que vai por aqueles homens todos no seu lugar, mas ao mesmo tempo ela consegue ser irritante por ser tao dura e agressiva, acaba por lhe faltar capacidade de empatia e honestamente consegue ser detestável, por isso temos um parceiro mais flexível, mais humano, igualmente brilhante mas não exactamente ao mesmo nível, o que temos de fraco é a história, na verdade a tentativa de mudança constante nos suspeitos, leva a que no final não seja grande a surpresa."
"This book features Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran, who were introduced in The Secret Place. They work mostly domestic violence cases and the murder of Aislinn Murray should have been just another routine case. Her new boyfriend is the obvious suspect, but something doesn’t set right and the veteran detective assigned to work with them is pushing too hard for a quick arrest.

Though I enjoyed the book, I got restive and had to put it down a few times. Conway trusts no one, is highly abrasive and intensely angry. It’s exhausting to live inside her head. Still, I appreciated her toughness and wry humor. She’s complex, like all of Tana French’s best characters."
"Really 3.5. I love the premise of French's Dublin Murder Squad series and I do like her voice. I found this one was a little wordy and the story could've been told in under 400 pages. I like how the main detective and the victim had several things in common. There was great banter. Good tension. But a lot of storytelling. A lot of hypotheticals as to what could've happened. And when we find out what did happen it gets played out several times. It was a little much for me. The conclusion was excellent, I just wish it happened a bit earlier. "
"Not as impressed with this book as I am with others in the series. In this one, Tony Conway is searching for the killer of a young woman who seems to have invited said killer into her home - the table is set, the woman is dressed up, the food is baked to a crisp in the oven, etc. So who done did it? Her new boyfriend, who rang the doorbell over and over, but then went home kind of deflated? But why was he spying on her? And who else was she seeing? And what's her connection to the disappearance of her father many years ago?

Well a lot of this is kind of an 'insular read,' as much of it takes place between the investigators working on the case, including the ongoing and outright 'bullying' which Tony has to endure from her fellow police officers. Yep, there's a lot of that here. This is not a 'cop story' where the MC has a lot of buddies and friends to lean on and go to when she needs a hand. In fact, there's almost none of that here, so in places you want to scream and shout: WHAT THE HECK!! Does this happen in real life?

I'm sure it does, though I'm also sure it's not as flagrant as it once was. (Or I hope so.) But you just want to scream ENOUGH ALREADY! Find the girl's killer!

So an intriguing enough read, if at times - many, many times - a frustrating one. If that's what the writer was going for with 'The Trespasser' she did so in spades ...........

Three stars."
"This book was picked for my Mystery Book Club and my first time with this author.
I listened to the audio and loved the narrator with her Irish accent it put right in Ireland.
I liked the story and the author is a very good writer but, this story was too wordy and my mind wandered at times listening to the audio. If you want to be a detective read this book because it seemed like nothing but interviews of suspects throughout the story.
I really liked the characters but didn't care for the main character Antoinette. She is a very intense and bitter person. Kind of feel sorry for her and her outlook on life and whatever she has been through. She had a great friend in Steven her partner.
Once you found out who done it then the story kind of dropped off.
I truly want to read more of her books because she seems to be a very good writer.
Just OK for me."

"I am a big fan of Tana French, as well as of good books set in Ireland.

This one #6 is my least fave of French’s novels. It was very very slowly paced. As it seemed to drag on and on, stalling over the smallest and dullest details, I almost gave up or screamed. I screamed…. lol.

To be fair, the premise was interesting and French’s snarky and fun writing didn’t fail to amuse me. I am too big a fan to give up on a Tana French police procedural crime novel so on I continued.

I also realized somewhere during this novel that I had skipped the previous one #5, so I’m happy to get back to another.

Happy reading folks."
"What i liked:
The writing was engaging and sophisticated, interrogation scenes were top notch with tons of psychological back-and-forth. Loved being in her head and always adjusting strategy.

What i disliked:
This is a crime novel and I disliked everything connected to murder and investigation.

The scope was so small. They had in the beginning two people who were connected to the victim and by the end all the info they got was from these same two people.
The investigation process was strange:
1. Get the first obvious suspect
2. Create crazy from thin air theory about some random gangster. Poke it for a while.
3. Return to the first suspect
4. Create second guess that is ridiculous out of nowhere once again because of a hunch
5. Bingo this time you are randomly stumbled on the right guy
6. Return to the first and only witness who was not a suspect, this time press a little more
7. This witness tells you the whole mystery with all the receipts
8. Then big daddy fixes everything
"
"Confesso que ia com expectativas elevadas para este livro..não se concretizaram...

Sendo um policial, esperamos um ritmo rápido e uma história com um desenrolar relativamente rápido e envolvente, contudo o mal deste livro é que se alongou demasiado em bastantes pormenores, fazendo com que aos poucos eu fosse perdendo o interesse e só queria chegar ao final para saber quem era o assassino..."
"This really drags. If you know that there are ego driven cops, as I do, you don’t need to read this novel. There is a nicely designed deus ex machina ending. "
"This is book 6 in the loosely connected Dublin Murder Squad series. In this one, Detective Antoinette Conway has teamed up with Detective Stephen Moran to solve the murder of a young woman, Aislinn Murray, who has been found dead at her home.

I haven't read any other books in the series - I only picked this up at a boot sale when I realised that it was a Richard & Judy Book Club pick for Summer 2017. I was a little worried about coming in on Book 6, would I miss a lot of backstory (this has happened before) and feel lost? In that respect, I needn't have worried. The character development is fantastic, I got a real feel for Antoinette and how she operates. While I didn't really like her, I felt that there was just enough history to understand why she behaves and thinks in certain ways, so I appreciated that.

The case itself wasn't interesting. I really didn't give a hoot about Aislinn or what she was like, for me the case took a backseat here in favour of the squad drama. I also didn't really enjoy the plot, I found it boring enough. I felt that there was no tension, no suspense. It dragged, for me, and I didn't find Aislinn's actions realistic or believable. I also disliked the chapter involving the person hovering around Antoinette's home - that was a loose end and just seemed to be shoved in there to further the plot, it was bizarre to read.

In saying all that - it's a solid 3/5, because it's not that I didn't enjoy it - It was okay - it's just not the type of crime book I normally read, it's much more centered on relationships within the squad than on the actual case. It was an okay read. But, it was 449 pages long and I felt every one of them, a chapter seemed to take me forever.

I will read the first 5 books in the series - but I'm delighted to find out that they don't all centre around Antoinette, because she's supremely unlikeable.

"As much as I love Tana French, I haven’t much enjoyed her last two books. Don’t get me wrong, she’s always a good read, but this one didn’t have that page-turning mystery.

It kept my attention but I didn’t find myself caring too much about the story. And you find out who the killer is a good deal before the book is over. I was expecting some kind of punch or twist at the end. Nope.

One of my favorite things is that her books usually have a supernatural element to them, which adds to the mystery & intrigue. I was disappointed that this didn’t have that.

Conway wasn’t the easiest MC to hang out with & there was waaaaay too much stuff that took place in the squad room. A lot of it was about the detectives’ relationships with each other. I found that pretty boring.

I’m hoping her next book rekindles my love."
"The Trespasser (Dublin Murder Squad #6)
Tana French

This is my first read in the Dublin Murder Squad series. So it is also my introduction to Detective Antoinette Conway, a new detective in the squad, and the only female. Yikes, does she have an attitude. She lives for the hunt, stops for nothing or nobody, and royally rips her partner for exploring some possibilities. Her minor lies, oversights, and omissions seem to be a required part of the job.

The best part of this story for me was the skillful intermix of conversations, interrogation, and mental analysis that takes place between Det. Conway and her suspects, colleagues, and peripheral characters. While interviewing an associate or witness or suspect, she is constantly reading the body language, evaluating how well the testimony fits the facts, looking for areas others want to avoid. It is a skillful blend of deduction, intuition, strategy, and analysis.

I will read more.

"3.65. I liked this book. The writing was, as per usual, terrific. Here's what made me not love it: 1) Detective Antoinette Conway's voice. It started out so strong and feisty and so full-on, but after a few hundred pages it started to grate-the ratatattatness of everything she saw or thought. It was just so bleak and angry and almost inhuman-sounding. I loved her then liked her then I just wanted to slap her. 2) Moran: he was such a pussy boy in this book. He came off so much more funny and interesting and decisive in the last book, which he narrated. Related to this: I found that Conway's character changed A LOT between the last book and this one. Like, I almost wish she'd just come up with two new MC's instead of sliding them into this one. 3) The plot was thin and dragged out. I stopped caring who did what to whom. 4) Breslin turned my stomach as he was supposed to, but all those confrontations wore me out. 5) The plot dump with Lucy. A pet peeve of mine, having a character fill the reader in on THE IMPORTANT DETAILS whilst sitting in a room facing another character. French uses this device a lot--LONG scenes of dialogue with a few puffs of cigarettes thrown in for good measure.

I did love Rory, though. What a great character. And I really enjoyed the missing-person backstory. And, as always, I loved the Dublin setting.

It's a funny relationship I have with French. I will never stop reading her. I am beyond excited for The Witch Elm, which is on my night table. I feel bad saying this but I'm a bit relieved that no Dublin Murder Squad folks will appear in that book.

"
"The Dublin Murder Squad is back, with detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran running the show. They are investigating a lover's spat gone fatally wrong, which at first seems like an easy slam-dunk, but it quickly twists out of control, placing the detectives in danger, in and out of the squad.
This is another solid police procedural and no one does psychological intensity and paranoia like French. I was not a fan of her last novel, The Secret Place but I am glad she returned to form in this one.
I still feel her books could use some editing, but the last 100 pages here are riveting."
"The latest books by French don't have the punch that her earliest works do. I can't put my finger on it, but the last couple of Murder Squad books seem to be more bran, less raisin. ""The Trespassers"" is a step in the right direction. The tension is back for the most part and it feels like the internal dynamics between the squad members is going somewhere.
The mystery itself is a good one in this book. I did feel for the victim and those she left behind. The ending left a bitter taste, but it was supposed to. Don't expect sunshine and roses. It is Tana French, after all."
This book is written from a police perspective. Many twists and turns. I wish people would just tell the truth.
"I found it a little tiring, going around in circles when the answer was obvious. Towards the end, however, the pace quickens and the plot unwraps fast. "
"""I live inside my own skin. Anything that happens outside it doesn't change who I am. This isn't something I'm proud of; as far as I'm concerned, it's a bare minimum baseline requirement for calling yourself an adult human being, somewhere around the level of knowing how to do your own washing or change a toilet roll. All those idiots on the websites, begging for other people to pull their sagging puppet-strings, turn them real: they make me want to spit.”

Pros of this book:
- Strong female protagonist: Antoinette is a no-nonsense, tough bitch and she knew it. Cursed with an absent dad and being the only non-white, female detective on her team, she been through a lot of shit and isolation. I think it is exceptionally difficult to write about a strong female protagonist without turning her into one of those one-sided radical-feminist-sprouting pile of mess, but Tana French's talent shone through. She really managed Antoinette bad-ass with just dabble of weakness. And what truly redeemed Antoinette was her insight and commentary on why she is the way she is. My favorite quote from her is as aforementioned.

Cons of this book:
- The drama started out very interesting, but it weakened in the end. Someone is found murdered, but there was absolutely no evidence to pinpoint anybody: no fingerprints, no fibers, no DNA. However, as the story progressed, I kinda get frustrated with the fact that the detectives kept chasing in circles: no leads, no new breakthroughs, and had to scraped every of their theories and restarted again. Which in itself is very realistic. Detective is a tough job, and sometimes you get cases where it baffled your logic. However, this make me dock off a star from the book as I did not get the suspense I felt with In the Woods and The Likeness . The ending was not as twisted and shocking, but I was satisfied.

Conclusion: It was an enjoyable read. I managed to finish 500 pages in 4 days. Tana French still stand as one of my favorite author on this genre, and random fact, turned out Gillian Flynn (one of my other favorite crime novelist) was also a big fan of her, which makes me so happy.

Updated list of my Tana French novels and their corresponding detectives, from my favorite to least:
1. The Likeness (Cassie Maddox)
2. Into the Woods (Rob Ryan)
3. The Trespasser (Antoinette Conway)
4. Faithful Place (Frank Mackey)"
"Wasn’t really feeling this one. It took me longer than normal to read it because I just started a new job and haven’t had a ton of time to read so that could be why I didn’t enjoy it as much.

However, Tana’s writing is still—irrevocably—one of the best writing around."
"How can this be #6 in the series? Ann is new to the murder squad and given her first interesting case. Previous books must have a different protagonist. Everybody hates Ann, or so she thinks. There was an incident we didn't see, where she put down one of the old hands and now she's the victim of unending cruel pranks designed to drive her off the squad.
She and her partner catch an apparent domestic, but the evidence is circumstantial and weak. In spite of that, their mentor is pushing for a quick arrest. Ann is nothing if not contrarian; the detectives dig deep and find evidence of a secret boyfriend.
The book has two flaws. A structural flaw in that characters do things they couldn't do: a detective maintains the innocence of an obviously guilty man (imagine if O.J. had a cop friend: 'Nah, it wasn't him. It was drug gangs.') And the squad is allowed to run badly because the parties tormenting Ann are allowed to destroy evidence SOLEY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INCONVENIENCING HER. Ha! The core goal of the murder squad is to be rid of Ann! Solving crimes is secondary!
The second flaw is chronic over-writing: now that I know it's the 6th book, I understand. By this point French has the cred necessary to overrule editors. So every character's every sentence is analyzed four ways: 'He said he didn't hurt her, but his face was ashen, the color of drying concrete, as though the blood had drained from the skin, leaving him pale and lifeless, like someone who was keeping in truths he couldn't face, the kind of truths that crush our soul, the kind of truths that can't be spoken, the kind of truths that alter our lives.' I have exaggerated here for effect, but I don't exaggerate when I say EACH LINE of each character's dialogue is analyzed and dissected. It makes it a wonderful book to skim-read."
A bit predictable and a lot long-winded. I added a star for the wonderful dialogue. 
I'm over 1/3 of the way through w/ this one and only mildly interested to finish it...
"La historia me ha parecido lenta; sin embargo, el tema de la corrupción policiaca, el abuso de poder y el hostigamiento laboral están muy bien planteados sientes la frustración de la protagonista, te indigna el machismo enraizado con que la tratan, ni que decir que odie a Breslin a cada letra que se escribía con él.
Me hace reflexionar que los peores delincuentes son los que visten de uniforme, a los otros los ves venir y sabes qué esperar, pero de los primeros esperas protección y, más frecuentemente, encuentras todo lo contrario.

The story seemed slow to me; However, the issue of police corruption, abuse of power and harassment are very well raised feel the frustration of the protagonist, you are outraged by the rooted machismo with which they treat, not to say that he hates Breslin to every letter that It was written with him.
It makes me think that the worst criminals are the ones who dress in uniform, the others you see coming and you know what to expect, but from the first you wait for protection and, more frequently, you find the opposite."
"As a Tana French fan, I had high hopes for this novel. But it's missing something significant: that gripping sense of mystery and suspense that characterizes so many of French's detective novels.

The plot is fairly bland; the detectives spend the entire book (almost 500 pages!) interviewing ONE main suspect. It isn't until the last hundred pages that a new ""twist"" -- an extremely predictable one -- is introduced. There's nothing in these pages that really hooked me; I didn't find myself connected to the detectives or gripped by the prospect of what would come next. While the plot hinges on a murder, the tone isn't ominous or suspenseful -- it's just the chronology of a (pretty boring) investigation.

Also, for the love of God, I couldn't read ""Me and Steve..."" one more time. The grammar lover in me cringed every time I saw it. Decent book, but glad I didn't buy it in hardcover."
"I will start with letting you know that I love Tana French books. I like her writing style, the way she introduces you to knew characters. I feel like I know the Dublin Murder Squad and I truly hope they make a movie or a TV series. This was not my favorite one in the series, though. It may be because I didn't love the main character, Antoinette. We met her briefly before... but I feel like French was trying too hard to depict her as a woman trying too hard... if that makes sense. I also felt the story line was not as interesting of as some of the others have been. I would definitely read it if you are a French fan. However, if this is your first experience with her, I would try The Likeness or even In The Woods to start. Otherwise, there are better detective crime books out there. Sorry to say. "
"I very much enjoyed 'Into the Woods' but I found this book somewhat underwhelming. It's again a Dublin murder squad police procedural. Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, are strong and complex characters with a very convincing working relationship. The atmosphere of sexism within the murder squad is strongly portrayed and the very lengthy interrogation scenes are the best part of the novel. The main problem is the length. This is a 300 page story stretched to 460. The murder case is made to see far more complex and interesting than it actually is."
"4th book I have read from the 'Dublin Murder Squad' books by Tana French, and by far the weakest I think. The main problem is, they are all essentially the same book - detective who is having trouble in personal life and/or not getting on with rest of squad, lands murder case that will make or break career - fights with partner, gets too involved in case personally, etc etc.
Essentially, they are pretty good, and I like them, but I didn't like this one as much as the others. I am not sure if that's because it is too similar, or its just not as good, but I think the latter."
"I have read most, if not all of Tana French's other novels and have enjoyed them. This one was not my favorite. It seemed to get a little bogged down, taking a while to get where it was going. I didn't feel particularly sympathetic to Antoinette Conway, the only female member of the Dublin Murder Squad. But, still, this is an enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys this author or police procedurals. "
I always enjoy Tana French books and I did enjoy this book but something about it made me think it would be better onscreen than in print. I love her characters and their complicated lives but felt I was left with even more questions at the end of this one. As always I devoured this in a few days so might go back and see if I missed some of the detail. I think this was a good book but not a great book.
"I've given it 3, 3.5- but the whole squad room squabble business is starting to get tired. If it was not for the fact that the target is a woman and we know that's reality in many instances. All the side stories add flavor but some don't ring true.
Overall a decent mystery, but not as good as the first 3 books ."
Couldn't finish it
Did not love this one...
"Three stars because, despite some really good elements to the story, the whole thing was a bit of a let down.

This is another story with Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran as lead detectives, just like the previous one. The difference is, while on the previous book, the events are told from Moran’s perspective, this one is told by Conway.

And Conway isn’t exactly your favourite person. No one, apart from Moran, likes her in squad and it looks like someone is putting in a great effort to get her kicked out of there. But it’s not just that. Antoinette Conway is one of those people who sees herself as strong, independent and capable, and anyone who isn’t like her is weak and not worth her time. So, she’s not just your typical though female officer; she’s actually a pain as a person.

In this book, things aren’t looking nice for her and the case she and Stephen are given isn’t exactly what it seems. I liked the case. But I didn’t like the way French put Conway leading the case.

There were confusing moments. Times when Conway didn’t seem to know what to do next. I won’t say she was a mess, because that’s not exactly true, but she was close. There’s even a moment when she starts suspecting her own partner, Moran, is behind some of the things happening in the squad.

Then, there were also the interview with one of the suspects, Rory Fallon. The guy is obviously really awkward and shy, someone who thought everything ahead, and the detectives treat him like crap. Obviously, towards the end of the story, we understand what’s going on, but it was a bit painful to see the guy being treated like that. And reading what Antoinette Conway thought of him. A whimp, of course.

So I guess I’ll go ahead and say that Conway was what did it for me. Whatever worked in the previous book, just didn’t do for this one. An interesting story, definitely, but with a main character that almost murdered the whole thing for me. Which is a shame."
"Me apetecía empezar el año leyendo algo policiaco y elegí el último libro publicado de Tana French, una escritora de la que ya había leído dos de sus novelas y me habían gustado bastante. Siento decir que en esta ocasión no he acertado. Intrusión es la sexta parte de una saga ambientada en la Garda irlandesa, a pesar de ser saga puede leerse de forma independiente ya que cada libro es un caso y un detective diferente.


En este la protagonista es Antoinette Conway y tiene que investigar el asesinato de una joven, aparentemente por violencia de género, aunque como ya sabemos en este género no todo es lo que parece. La historia para mi gusto empezó muy bien, pero creo que para lo que cuenta la ha enrevesado mucho. A partir de cierto punto sentí que daban vueltas a lo mismo constantemente y que teniendo todas las pistas delante seguía en lo mismo solo para rellenar páginas.


Todo se desarrolla entre la investigación en sí y la vida de la protagonista pues está contado en primera persona. Me ha parecido muy cargante ella y que está muy a la defensiva todo el rato. Es verdad que sufre bastantes putadas por ser mujer en el trabajo, pero su actitud de “puedo con todo sin ayuda de nadie” creo que algunas veces le juega malas pasadas. No he empatizado nada y me ha parecido demasiado cargante su actitud.


En cuanto a la investigación, nada nuevo, me olí el pastel antes de la mitad del libro y no me equivoqué. Me resultó obvio y que no cuenta ni añade nada nuevo al género.

No ha sido para mi, aún así te recomiendo El silencio del bosque, si quieres animarte a leer a la autora."
"The Trespasser is a Tana French novel that falls towards the better end of her canon, but it gets off to a very slow start. Hard done by Murder detective Antoinette Conway is an alienating narrator. You can tell that she has been mistreated, but her attitude permeates the core of the book and this has an effect on your own wellbeing. Conway also has a particularly vulgar turn of phrase (the amount of times that she mentions the “hole” is staggering).

Add to that that for the first half of the book she entertains a solution to her case based on nothing, and The Trespasser has a frustrating start.

However. The back end of The Trespasser turns the claustrophobic nature of the novel as a whole to its advantage. Where the laser focus on this one case with almost no external storyline had been exhausting up to that point, it becomes an asset. Conway inches ever closer to the truth and reveals more of her character to the reader but, more importantly, to herself. The last few hundred pages disappear at a rate that would surprise people who slogged their way through the first few, and the payoff is not insignificant.

The Trespasser nearly inches its way towards four stars, but nigh on 600 pages is a long book when it spends so many of the initial entries confounding the audience. You’re ultimately in for a good ride with this book, but French makes you work for it."
"3,5 stelline

Ultimo libro della serie Dublin Murders di Tana French, e io piango tantissimo perchè ne vorrei altri dieci da leggere, grazie e prego!
Dando un'occhiata alla recensioni mi sembra che questo volume sia fra i più amati dell'autrice, mentre personalmente io l'ho trovato sotto alcuni aspetti un po' meno ""brillante"" dei precedenti, un po' più statico, e mi è sembrato mancare un poco della tipica atmosfera che pervade i romanzi di questa serie. Poco male, perchè si tratta comunque di un thriller godibilissimo, che tiene incollati alle pagine, e che, come sempre nei libri di French, trova nei personaggi e nelle loro interazioni il suo vero cuore.
""L'Intruso"" è una storia sulle storie, quelle che tutti noi ci raccontiamo per dare un senso alla nostra vita, perchè ci aiutino a fare i conti con il passato, a costruirci degli alibi e a darci speranza. E le storie non sempre finiscono bene, anzi, il più delle volte, finiscono davvero tremendamente male."
"Die irischen Autorin Tana French schreibt Kriminalromane der besonderen Art. Genretypisch gibt es natürlich gewaltsame Todesfälle, eine Mordkommission, die in Dublin beheimatet ist und ein Team von Kriminalbeamten, das die Fälle bearbeitet. Das war es dann aber auch schon mit den Gemeinsamkeiten, denn French setzt andere Prioritäten. Es ist zwar die Beschreibung der Polizeiarbeit, die ihr die Folie liefert, vor deren Hintergrund sie das en détail schildert, was ihr am Herzen liegt, nämlich die Psyche ihrer Ermittler. Und so ganz nebenbei reißt sie auch immer wieder gesellschaftspolitische Themen an. In dem aktuellen Fall geht es unter anderem um die Frage, inwieweit sich Frauen anpassen bzw. verbiegen müssen, um Anerkennung zu erlangen und akzeptiert zu werden.

„Gefrorener Schrei“ ist der sechste Band der Reihe, und diesmal geht es um den Tod einer jungen Frau, die in Erwartung eines romantischen Abendessens von ihrem Liebhaber ermordet wurde. So weit, so klar – oder etwa doch nicht? Antoinette Conway und Stephen Moran wird der Fall übertragen, und der Leser begleitet die beiden Detectives in ihrem Arbeitsalltag. Und genau das ist wieder eine der Besonderheiten der Autorin: in jedem ihrer bisherigen Romane steht ein anderes Ermittlergespann im Mittelpunkt, um das herum sie den Fall nach und nach aufrollt. Dabei versenkt sich die Autorin tief in das Seelenleben ihrer Protagonisten hinein und lässt den Leser nicht nur an den Spekulationen und Erfolgen, sondern auch an deren Selbstzweifeln und Rückschlägen teilhaben. Der vorliegende Roman ist aus Conways Sicht erzählt, aktuell die einzige Frau im Team der Mordkommission, die dementsprechend misstrauisch von ihren männlichen Kollegen beäugt wird und von Anfang an die Ellenbogen ausfahren muss, um sich Respekt zu verschaffen. Und obwohl sie einen guten Job macht, verweigern ihr die Kollegen die verdiente Anerkennung. Und da Rache ein Gericht ist, das am besten kalt serviert wird, enthält sie ihnen dafür wichtige Ermittlungsergebnisse vor. Und so kann sie mit ihrem Partner Moran in aller Ruhe der Vermutung nachgehen, die sie seit Beginn der Untersuchung hat: jemand aus dem Team behindert die Aufklärung des Mordes. Wer ist es, und welches Interesse steckt dahinter? Und gab es eine Verbindung zwischen der Toten und einem von Conways Kollegen?

Die ersten vier Romane Tana Frenchs habe ich sehr gerne gelesen, „Geheimer Ort“ (Bd. 5) konnte mich leider nicht überzeugen, was aber vielleicht auch damit zusammenhing, dass mich der Plot immer wieder an Donna Tartts Roman „Die geheime Geschichte“ erinnert hat.

„Gefrorener Schrei“ nun lässt mich zwiespältig zurück. Viel zu viel Nabelschau der Protagonisten, viel zu viele Was-wäre-wenn Szenarien, die unnötige Längen kreieren und so die Geduld des Lesers auf eine harte Probe stellen. Bleibt mir nur zu schlussfolgern, dass die eine oder andere Kürzung die Story mit Sicherheit nicht verfremdet, sondern ihr im Gegenteil eher gut getan hätte.

"
Maybe it is just my mindset lately but this one was not as good as her others which I gave at least a 4* to. It dragged a lot in long chapters and scenes and though I like long books. It seemed to drag on in audio. I just wanted it over when I passed 80%. I kind of liked the tinge of Romance for once when I usually do not. I do not remember Conway being so harsh in other books. Her callousness annoyed me this time. It may be I am not focused as when I read her others. Lots of stress in my life at the moment. She does write a great twisted thriller Mystery though.
"*3.5 starsI really enjoyed this! It was a bit of a slow build-up, but, as always, I was still engaged with the story. It’s not my favourite Tana French (see: The Likeness) but it was a really good read. It especially helped that it was much better than my last read, which had a similar (but more disappointing) character with a constructed relationship/life that is only revealed later in the novel. Overall a solid read, and can’t wait to get my hands on another one of French’s novels!"
"Unfortunately this was a bit of a let down for me. I always love the world Tana creates, and I love her writing style to death... But this one just didn't grab my attention... I felt like I was reading just another thriller, it was pretty bland.. and the story was pretty bland and ordinary. The only thing I did like was the psychology of the main characters.

Overall, it left me feeling uninspired."
"A really interesting police procedural. The main character and first person narrator is the only female detective on the murder squad. She and her partner are put in charge of the investigation of the murder of a young woman. A more experienced detective is assigned to assist them, but does he mean to assist them to the truth or keep them from finding it?

It really kept my interest, but I could have done without the frequent rough language, which I suppose adds to its authenticity."
This book had me in its clutches clear up until the ending which I found long winded and very unsatisfying. It felt like the 2 main detectives just rolled over and let someone else do their dirty work for them 
"Dear Tana French, thank you for always filling my police procedural love tank. You've become my go to. But please, don't you dare try to get me to empathize with Roach or Brennan in your hypothetical next book. I won't do it."
I've so loved all of Tana French's books but this one I found kind of boring! No interesting characters!
ACAB
"Plotting a mystery novel is a challenging task. A truly successful writer manages to lay out a plot that is not only suspenseful to the end but grounded in a semblance of reality. Other writers, including some of the best, occasionally resort to coincidence to make their plots work. The worst recent example of coincidence carried to a laughable extent is Paula Hawkins’ runaway bestseller The Girl on the Train. Several highly improbable coincidences are all that make that story hang together, and I simply can’t comprehend how the book has remained on the New York Times bestseller list for so long. Building a plot in such a way is a sign of laziness. It’s a trap. Unfortunately, Tana French, who’s a far better writer than Hawkins, fell into a similar trap when writing The Trespasser, the sixth in her Dublin Murder Squad series. Though I found only two major unlikely coincidences in the story, they marred the credibility of the story. I’ve now read the whole series. I find The Trespasser one of the weakest — though it’s still far superior to the run-of-the-mill fare to be found in detective fiction. The suspense is palpable.

An intriguing police procedural

The narrator in this police procedural set in Dublin is Detective Antoinette Conway. She’s a two-year veteran of the elite Murder Squad. As the only woman on the squad, and one with a huge chip on her shoulder at that, Conway is shunned by most of the other detectives. She considers herself lucky to be partnered with Detective Steve Moran, whom she recently helped join the squad. They work together on the night shift and are used to catching domestic violence cases that pose little challenge. So they’re not surprised to be assigned early one morning to what seems like another straightforward case of one-spouse-beats-up-the-other. But the very last thing that might be said about this case is that it’s straightforward. The assignment — a murder case rather than a beating — will consume their every waking moment for many days and shake the Murder Squad to its core.

The Dublin Murder Squad: a clever device

Nearly all detective series center around one, usually heroic character. The series is typically named after him or her. Tana French takes a different tack in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Each book features a different detective on the squad, one who was introduced as a minor character in an earlier book. This approach allows French to keep the setting fresh and to portray the breadth of cultural and sociological detail that make Dublin such a fascinating city. Detective Antoinette Conway narrates the tale in The Trespasser. The book is written in the casual and ungrammatical way that a young, lower-class woman such as Conway might well speak in conversation.

Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Tana French, a well-known actress as well as a writer, might choose to inhabit a different protagonist in each book in the series. Clearly, that works for her."
"This book has no life... Just a lot of words. Pointless words.
Personally, the plot was okay but I feel this book coulda been a couple of hundred pages shorter"
"I truly love Tana French. I think she is one of the best thriller/mystery writers out there right now, and she continually brings new ideas and twists to the genre, and it's pretty incredible. I do have to say that The Trespasser is by far her weakest installment to date. That is not to say that it isn't any good, it just didn't have the panache that her earlier novels possessed. I feel really bad saying that it is weak as well. It's not weak in the sense that the story isn't captivating (although there are moments that drag on a little too long), it's not weak in the characters, Conway is actually pretty badass, and knows exactly what she needs to do to make her life either easier, or harder, or just doesn't give an eff (I choose the latter), it's not even weak in the who-dun-it category. There is just something that feels a little off in the story telling. I sense that there was one thing that French got caught up on and just had a hard time moving forward with the storytelling.

The murder that is being investigated has it's moments of stress and compelling action, but that particular story just cycles through and through until the very end, and then that is even a little bit of a let down. Take any of French's earlier works and you have the unbelievable, but at the same time there's a high interest, whether it's possums living in the ceiling, a cop pretending to be a murdered girl, or what have you, there is a sense of disbelief, and wonderment, and those are the things that are lacking with The Trespasser. It's all too simple and a little bit of a let down. However, and I know this probably won't happen, but if French writes her next book it is focuses on Conway again, then that is something that would be worth reading... through and through. If anything, The Trespasser leaves a huge hang at the end and I would love to see what would/will transpire in Conway's life after the situation she found herself in at the end of this novel.

So, overall, a good read... especially if you are a French fan, but it doesn't compare to what she has written previously, and honestly, that's okay... because I am anxiously awaiting her next installment."

This is a police procedural, crime thriller that is a part of the Dublin Murder Squad series. This novel opens with the murder of a young woman. Although it initially appears to be an open/close domestic dispute involving the dead woman’s boyfriend, Detective Antoinette Conway soon realizes something far more sinister is going on.

Since it's the sixth in the series, I was worried about the fact that I hadn't read any of the other books. I went ahead with it anyways. I was able to follow the plot no problem; each novel is a separate story line. However, I do feel like I would have understood and would have been more connected to the characters if I had read the books in order.

This book gave me some seriously mixed feelings. I had trouble getting into the plot at first. I found that sometimes her writing became too descriptive and I got lost in the wording instead of in the story. I found myself becoming more confused with the police procedural than enjoying it while it all unfolded. Halfway through the book, it took a turn for the better. I became extremely invested in the story. As the plot developed and the Squad followed the murder trail, it was hard to put this book down. I loved the twists that French through into the plot and the red herrings that were consistently planted. I’m always a fan of a kick-ass female lead, so Antoinette Conway as the lead detective was fantastic.

This is not a book for someone who is looking for a fast, paced thriller. However, if you are a fan of police procedurals and enjoy a slow moving read then this would be the novel for you!

"Have love, love, loved past titles in this series - especially FAITHFUL PLACE - but this one fell flat for me. This time, the action focuses on Detective Antoinette Conway, who is very, very angry and has about had it with her immature colleagues. She and her partner get loaded with what looks like another straightforward 'domestic' - woman dead on a hearth with a fancy dinner in the oven. It turns out to be anything but, but it's not til around p. 300 that it gets interesting. And 300 pages is a lot of pages to read before it gets interesting. Up to that point, there's a lot of dialogue - A LOT - mostly in the form of interviews with suspects and flat out interrogations. The lack of action makes the scenes - which could be interesting and even outstanding in the midst of more action - a slog. I know police work is often tedious, but when you're reading about it you don't want quite this much authenticity. And Conway herself and her frustrations with the squad occupy many other pages, but without ever really revealing much about her. She's left oddly one-dimensional. That said, once things pick up, they really pickup. There's a big run-up to the end that reminds you how good French is. Definitely stick with the Squad, but maybe skip this one. "
"For myself, no. However, I believe I have given three of these Dublin Murder Squad books four stars and one I awarded one star and abandoned it because that particular day I simply could not read the rough and vulgar language. At that time I claimed I would not read Tana French again, so maybe this time I will get specific. Generally, I am not attracted to hard-edged female detectives, but one must allow for those who are fascinating and/or refined and/or brilliant, right?
Interesting bits include the challenge of a female surviving in the Dublin Murder Squad despite hostility and continued conflict. Or is it tiresome? This time round Conway is working well with her male partner Steve Moran. They are set up with a murder investigation by nasty Breslin in a scheme that I will not reveal. Example of typical prose: ""The only way he can get a stiffy is by bullying people into tears."" [talking about Breslin] Now I'm in tears.
""We were a gift. The perfect stooges."" Why would this young woman wish to continue in this punishing job? Don't know. I think I am now ready to turn in my badge.

"I just finished listening to In the Woods by Tana French and I'm now even more disappointed with The Trespasser than I was after I first listened to it. In the Woods had a few disappointments but it was lyrically told and the story and kept me interested and moving along, despite its length. The Trespasser is just as long, but it contained so much repetititiveness and filler that I got impatient for it to be over. I plan to continue reading with book 2 and see how the series progresses. I'm intrigued that while some characters carry over, there are many new characters and at least with these two books, a new narrator with a different voice. Both narrators are uniquely flawed and their first-person perspective is limited. At the beginning of In the Woods, the narrator explains that police lie in the service of Truth. This is played out frequently during interrogations where the officers play a part to get on a suspect's good side. But once you can justify lying, it becomes easy to carry it beyond the interrogation room and lie not only to others but to yourself, and soon your reality is created entirely out of lies."
"This book was hard to rate for me. I felt that the book was well written so I struggled over 3 or 4 stars. I settled with 3 because ultimately I felt that it was too long and missing some element to draw you into the main character. It was hard for me to feel a connection with Antoinette and I found her a bit unlikeable. I also felt that the relationship that was introduced with her father and mother were wholly undeveloped, especially considering this was an almost 500 page novel. However, something about Tana French’s writing made me unable to give up on the book, but I found myself wondering “when is this going to be brought to conclusion?” I might have picked the wrong novel as my first French, but like I said something about her writing doesn’t make me want it to be my last. I’d like to try another of her more popular books and see how I feel about them. "
"Окей, Стивен Моран и Антуанетта Конвей снова в деле, как и в предыдущем романе - ""Тайное место"".
Только вот магии не повторилось.
Потому что в прошлый раз мы наблюдали происходящее глазами Стива, а в этот раз - от лица Антуанетты. И мне не слишком импонирует её манера параноить, перманентное желание прищемить собеседнику мошонку дверью или к херам обгладать ему лицо, господи, да эта женщина сама себя едва выносит, и только к концу книги сходит с этого поезда безумия, несущегося в пропасть.
А вот переводчику огромнейший респект. Он смог весьма разнообразно и оригинально передать весь этот поток крепких выражений, плещущий из детективов (и особенно из Конвей, конечно, вот она ни разу не ромашка)."
"I'm really sad at the trajectory of Tana French's writing. Her first two (or maybe even three) Dublin Murder Squad books were stunning blends of police procedural and literary fiction, but the last three books have been getting flatter and flatter. This one needed some seriously rigorous editing to pare down the interminable interrogation and interview scenes. In general, pacing was very slow and the ending felt very much like a whimper rather than a bang. She's still gangbusters at crafting unique voices for her character and masterful at building paranoia-fueled suspense, but the politics of the squadroom didn't interest me as much as I hoped they would."
"In the beginning I was really looking forward to reading this book having heard a lot about the author. I think it was possibly a good view of how to investigate a crime when you're the detective and not the tv viewer who sees 'whodunnit' but it was so repetitive. Will they go with scenario A or B? And, basically, that was the complete novel. It could have been sharper and much more readable if it just hadn't went on for so long. By the time I got to who did do it, I was getting to the stage of not caring less. Sorry, but not one for me."
"I have enjoyed reading French's entire series. I am not sure that I would say that these are the best mysteries that I have ever read, but I love the idea of taking a minor character from one book and making them the major first-person character in the next. I also like French's dialogue and characters. I do find some of these books more convincing than others (I am not a fan of the mild supernatural elements in some of the books, and I find several of the plots somewhat flimsy), and this final book of the Dublin Murder Squad is to me one of the best."
"The protagonist, Antoniette Conway, is one of the most misanthropic, whiney, judgmental characters I've ever stumbled across. I wouldn't have finished the book if I hadn't been listening to it and the narrator was wonderful. Antoniette's constant mental criticisms of every single person she encounters ruined the mystery for me.I gave the book two stars because Antoinette shows the beginning of a little self awareness at the end, but for me it was a little too little, a little too late."
"Actual Rating: 2.5 Stars
There wasn't a lack of trying on my part. The build-up was just so slow that it took out the 'thrill of anticipation'. The element of surprise also just went out the window. The red herrings didn't work the way red herrings usually make me feel. But I did anticipate the ending enough to continue on and finish it."
"I loved Broken Harbour and In the Woods, but The Trespasser was a little slow, with the hardboiled female detective and too-lengthy descriptions interrupting dialogue. It fell more squarely into the detective genre than her other novels; this one had less of French's characteristic psychological depth."
New to Tana French - know she has an enormous and loyal following - but just not for me. 
"The story is good. The ""detectiving"" is good. But I really hated Antoinette Conway until near the end when she starts using higher brain function for things other than suspect's interviews.

Rant about Conway: 
People expect her to be a bitch, so she just is one, instead of attempting to get along with people. And then she goes and pouts about how everyone thinks she's a bitch. She lashes out at people and then ""woe is me; people always leave; I knew this would happen!"" She's reading into everyone's words and actions as if she's the only thing in everyone else's world and all of their energy is going into fucking with her. I want to throw the book across the room every time she says ""I get the message"" or ""They think I'm going to lash out"" or whatever. But I don't because I'm reading this on my phone and phones are expensive.
I really like her interviews. I like when she is working on the case. Her interviews with Rory have been my favorite parts. Even when she gets all swept up in Steve's crazy ideas (as ridiculous as I think those theories are), she's okay. It's when she is interacting with almost anyone and she puts her own paranoid conspiracy theories on that person. She absolutely knows what they are thinking/feeling and it's all bad; it's all AT her. I absolutely understand these feelings. I have them often. Like ""oh this person is just talking to me because they are nice, not because they like me."" But then I walk away and I think, it's possible they like me a little bit.
Conway has ZERO room for any possibility that she might be wrong about absolutely everyone being out to get her. She thinks she is at the forefront of everyone's mind at all times. THAT is the thing that is really really driving me crazy about her. I don't have a problem with the idea of it's hard to be a woman on the force blah blah thing. Even the hard outer shell so she doesn't come off as vulnerable. Fine. I get it.
I cannot stand her listening to someone say things and her assuming every little thought going through their head is sneakily weaved into some sort of way to screw her over. Maybe... just MAYBE, SOME of the detectives/floaters/any other humans, are just doing their job the majority of the time? Maybe other people have their own shit to deal with and they aren't spending 24 hours a day thinking of ways to get rid of her? Maybe she's not the center of everyone's universe?

The story: 
At first this was ridiculous with Steve and Conway thinking Aislinn was all tangled up with a gang or something. It was just so silly. I knew it wasn't Rory and there was something more interesting going on. There was.

McCann, fellow detective, was having an affair with Aislinn and HE killed her when he found out about her boyfriend Rory. I do think her whole weird thing with McCann (getting back at him for not telling her and her mom that they found her dad when he was a missing person) was kind of weird. A lot of the story was a bit convoluted because of that."
"Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran, the detectives from French's previous novel, The Secret Place , are given a new murder case, one that looks to be a straightforward ""domestic incident."" Yet nothing seems to fit quite right as Antoinette and Steve investigate Rory for the death of his girlfriend Aislinn, and matters become yet more complicated when Antoinette finally remembers where she's seen Aislinn before. Add in that the more experienced detectives on Dublin's Murder Squad seem to want Antoinette and Steve to run a no-frills investigation and put the case to bed as soon as possible, and it's no wonder the pair realize there's something more going on than immediately meets the eye . . .

The Secret Place was a very long book, especially since the events of its primary narrative (there were flashbacks) all took place in a single day, something that didn't trouble me too much as I was stuck in the hospital while reading it. The Trespasser is equally long, and its narrative covers just a few days.

And I have to confess I eventually . . . wearied of it. As each new set-piece -- witness interview, whatever -- began, I became increasingly reluctant as I settled myself in for what I knew would be yet another long chapter. How fast do they speak in Dublin, I wondered, because what read to me like a couple of hours' worth of dialogue would be fitted into what was apparently a half-hour conversation. The plot is great and Antoinette, our prickly, profanity-addicted narrator, is an enjoyable companion, but the novel seemed to me to be woefully overlong -- perhaps twice as long as its not especially labyrinthine plot needed it to be.

Just getting rid of the gratuitous obscenities might cut about ten percent of the wordage! Okay, maybe not quite that much, but . . . And I say ""gratuitous"" because, while I'm hardly Little Mr. Prim myself, even I was rolling my eyes at them sometimes, as if Antoinette were an adolescent trying to Shock The Adults with her effing and blinding.

I liked French's first novel, In the Woods, a very great deal, which is why I read her second, The Likeness, which I adored unconscionably. But each time since then I've become more and more aware how long the books are; it's a judgment in itself that I should have been thinking this while reading. I still have Faithful Place to read in French's Murder Squad series, and doubtless I'll get around to it someday, but maybe I'll leave it a while."
"3.5 stars.

This was a much more enjoyable installment in the DMS series than the previous two. Steven and Antoinette worked so well together and the amount of snark and witty comments there were made the entire thing a fun read.

However, this is was SO. SLOW. AND. PLODDING. Which typically I wouldn't mind--I do like myself a good slow novel every once in awhile and I'm all for more accurate depictions of police and detective work in fiction, and this met both criteria--it was too heavy on the telling vs. showing and the case quickly became one I didn't care too much about. Every interview seemed unnecessarily long and half the time was only revealing things that had already been confirmed, whether by obvious suspicions or previous evidence. Nothing was really surprising when revealed/confirmed. And, as with I think all of the previous DMS books, the ending was anticlimactic as heck and made the entire thing feel pointless. Which I suppose is accurate, but when it doesn't even end with a cliffhanger or surprising decision 
Maybe if Conway had decided to quit the force, that would have been more surprising than deciding to stay on. it just makes it feel like a wasted two weeks of reading.

The characterizations were the strongest part for me, as they have been in prior installments. Conway can come across as paranoid and whiney, yes, but I also don't blame her for being paranoid in the situation she's in--plus, it adds a very valid and believable flaw to her character. The entire side plot with her father, though, seemed pointless and only vaguely tied to the case. The case triggered memories and issues for her, but these issues 
never actually ended up being relevant to the case at hand.

Overall, I really enjoyed this, but also found it too tedious to really enjoy properly.

(Cross posted on my blog.)"
"it's really painful for me to give Tana French a 3. Honestly most author's it would have been a 4. . .but I expect so much out of her because she's my fave mystery/thriller writer.

It was still great! I did not see the ending coming at all and I found characters in turns hate-able and relatable. It's hard to pull that off and she managed it. There were some truly great back and forth which I consider to be her specialty and the writing is tough but descriptive. I will probably read it again eventually because it is still very good.

But it really lacks the feeling of pulling back the facade that she is so great at. There were characters who felt like nothing but their playacting and while that is explained by plot/character introspection. . .it takes something from the book to me. Especially because one of the characters that seems most poorly drawn is part of the mystery.

Also . . .there was a little bit too much sudden realization for me. I like it best when it's not an epiphany, it's things falling into place . . .

regardless it was still a very interesting story and I feel like the glimpse I got of the gaffer was really eye opening. Wondering if he might be next viewpoint?

ugh I'm considering going to a 4 but I think I'm gonna stick with my 3"
"Heiß ersehnt und dann doch etwas enttäuscht. Das lag vor allem an der durchwegs sehr empörten Ich-Erzählerin (Antoinette Conway), die sich von allem und jedem angegriffen fühlte. Ist halt ihr Charakter, ok, aber trotzdem mühsam, weil so unreflektiert. Und richtiggehend gestört hat mich der völlig aus der Luft gegriffene Verdacht 
der Bandenkriminalität recht früh in der Aufklärungsphase. Unabhängig von der weiteren Entwicklung und dem Abschluss des Falles, passte das für mich einfach nicht zu dem Team Conway und Moran.

Ansonsten wie für Tana French nicht unüblich ein eher langsamer Start über 200-300 Seiten, der Schwerpunkt liegt auf den Charakteren, so dass die Auflösung des Falls eher wie ein nice to have erscheint als dass sie den Spannungshöhepunkt darstellt. Gerne und in einem Zug gelesen, kommt aber nicht an meine ""Lieblinge"" Totengleich und Geheimer Ort heran. In Letzterem wurden übrigens Antoinette Conway und Steve Moran eingeführt."
"The Trespasser has the elements of a really good murder mystery but it falls short of its promise in the many detours French builds off of the main story. I’ve read all of French’s Dublin Murder Squad books. She has a talent for developing interesting main and peripheral characters as well complex whodunnits. The Antoinette Conway/Steve Moran detective duo in this story, paired again after The Secret Place, should work. However, Conway’s paranoid narcissism gets in the way much too often. We’re subjected to her internal monologues at every turn, which does very little to advance the plot and only serves to make Conway more annoying. Enough already! I get why she wasn’t liked by her squad and am only left wondering why Moran put up with her.

The main story itself is good, even though I think the perp was fairly easy to identify. French throws in enough twists to place reasonable doubt here and there. The last dozen pages are the best (no coincidence it’s also where Conway takes a backseat)... but arrive about 100 pages past when I stopped caring how the book would end."
"We were sorely disenchanted with the just prior novel in this set, “Secret Place”, as it featured seemingly endless interviewing of a bunch of brats at an all-girl private high school. Back from that endeavor in “Trespasser” (currently the sixth and last entry in the series) are Dublin Murder Squad’s already chummy Detectives Antoinette Conway and partner Stephen Moran, who have caught a night-shift murder of an attractive 20-something. The woman’s boyfriend, soon proven to be on the premises at about the time of death, is of course an immediate suspect; and what follows is seemingly endless interviewing – sound familiar ?! – of him and the woman’s best girlfriend. Eventually clues indicate another possible perpetrator, leading to a brilliant resolution by the squad’s big boss.

We have no argument with author French’s plot development and writing skills; her police procedurals are usually sufficiently interesting. We just wish some courageous editor would amputate about a quarter of these tales to relieve some of the tedious details of interviewing persons of interest. In our opinion, that would improve these novels from merely interesting to consistently enjoyable and entertaining."
"Had a hard time getting through much of this book. Frankly Antoinette ticked me off (like an angry teen). And I’m a fan of take no shit, tough ass female characters. She was so hard on being a rough tough cop, she didn’t know how to be a feeling human. She was facing, sexism and harassment at work. Refused to see when genuine, kind human beings existed, male or female and much of the time took her anger and frustration on them. This was annoying but frankly I understood Tana French wanted us to learn about what fueled Conway, how she thought and that every female cop character doesn’t have to be cookie cutter and aim for likeability. I appreciated that piece. It got good towards the end but felt like this dragged 3/4 of the boo. I adore Tana French , this is just not my top pick for the Dublin Murder Squad series . "
"Dass dieses Buch zu einer Serie gehört, habe ich erst viel später herausgefunden. Meiner Meinung nach kann man es problemlos auch unabhängig von den anderen Büchern lesen. In meiner Wahrnehmung ging es ungefähr die Hälfte tatsächlich um den Fall, die andere Hälfte um die Befindlichkeiten von Detective Antoinette Conway, die sich von ihrem gesamten Dezernat gemobbt fühlt und regelmässig ausrastet. Einen Schwerpunkt auf Ersterem hätte ich deutlich spannender gefunden, aber dann wäre das Buch wahrscheinlich nur halb so lang geworden, denn die Story um den Mord scheint mir insgesamt recht ""dünn"". Als Reiselektüre oder so ""nebenbei"" aber auf jeden Fall geeignet und sehr schnell zu lesen. Vielleicht schaue ich ja doch mal in einen anderen Band der Serie hinein... ."
"Murder Mystery with Twists

If you’re looking for a murder mystery that continuously has twists throughout the story, then this is it for you. I could not tell where the author was going with this until around 3/4 of the way through and then it became somewhat predictable. I almost wish there’d been another huge plot twist at the very end to surprise me one last time. The main characters attitude of “the whole world is against me” got a bit old after a while and I didn’t feel like her character evolved like I would have hoped. I enjoyed the mystery of Aislinn and her character slowly being revealed more than Antoinette. All in all, The Trespasser kept me turning to the next page and I would recommend if you’re looking for a solid murder mystery novel."
"A difficult read!
But a brilliantly crafted crime novel, nevertheless.
I love the rich atmosphere of Tana French's novels - but somehow all the extra information in The Trespasser drowned out the actual story.
We meet Antoinette Conway, a member of the Dublin Murder Squad and she is one hard cookie, she is basically a stone cold bitch and she is partnered with the sweetie Steve Moran that we met in the Secret Place... and together they investigate the murder of Aislinn Murray who was found beaten to death in her house... the investigation is SUPER thorough and every possible angle is explored and pondered and it makes for really boring reading, unfortunately.
I dunno, this was not the best TF for me.
"
"3.5*

It pains me to only give this one a 3.5* rating but it wasn't at the same level as other books in the series.

I found the investigation to be frustrating - I know these are ""rookie"" detectives, but they spent so much time chasing down a wild goose chase that was based almost completely on conjecture. The protagonist had such a chip on her shoulder that it was impossible to trust anyone or anything. Also, I kept forgetting that the protagonist was a woman. It wasn't that I expected her to be constantly twirling her hair or applying lipstick but her characterization fell flat for me in many ways. However, shoutout to Aislinn because THAT was a fascinating character. It's nice when the victim in a homicide story becomes so well realized."
"My first Tana French. Antoinette Conway really put me off at first--the paranoia, blaming everyone else for everything, not being much of a team player with her partner--and I wondered if I would finish it. But it was on my Kindle on a trip, and I did not have too many options, and eventually it pulled me in. Glad I finished it.

I really didn't even know much about the Dublin Murder Squad series, but now understand one can read them in no particular order. I will try other ones, although I did feel there were a lot of red herrings in this that might possibly be edited down a bit. Maybe just me.

"
"This is my first in Tana French's ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series, and I found it to be an overwrought police procedural with Garde Detective Antoinette Conway at its center...She's viewed as just a new ""DEI Hire"" to the Dublin Murder Squad and who has gotten a very cool reception. She's disliked and has been subjected to active employment place harassment, so we have another one in the female-centered, men are shite genre...Conway and her partner Steve Moran are thrown into a murder involving a young woman found after a punch to the face caused her to fall and hit her head...A tightly woven plot, with some extensive and drawn-out interrogation scenes...Decent twist at the end...Just okay!"
"I'll give it 3.75 stars. It was interesting enough but so damn long and drug out. And I thought the tiny bit with Antoinette's dad showing up in the story was sort of random and out of place. Especially since he was only in the story briefly. Once they figured out who the murderer was, the book went on for another 100 or more pages when I think it could've been wrapped up sooner. I also thought some of the characters were kind of vague (like her partner Steve) however, being that it's part of a character series may explain why that is. "
"3.5! I still don't think any of her others are as good as In The Woods, but I liked this more than the witch elm and I'm glad the detective got a relatively happy ending, which I feel like never happens in Tana French books lol. Very atmospheric and I liked the characters. The main character at first annoyed me a lot with how paranoid she was about others (though it was definitely warranted) but I was glad to see this change over the course of the book. Plot wise, I guessed what was going to happen, but it was still fun to watch it play out. "
"I love mysteries with well-rounded characters, and Antoinette is a satisfying protagonist in that respect, but I found that the story itself dragged on - mainly because of the endless interrogation scenes and discussions about the various theories, without any break to pause the reading. Readers who enjoy carefully crafted dialogues might love these, but I personally find them a bit tedious and I skimmed through some of them. And convoluted revenge plots just make me roll my eyes, these days, so I did not find Aislinn’s story especially compelling. "
"3.5
While I thought this was well written, it's just not the book for me. The police procedural is so slow moving and single minded. Unlike a domestic thriller, where you're discovering a character's backstory and relationships and seeing how they tie together, this book has the case and only the case. There is basically no ""off screen"" time; you are constantly following Conway in here day to day activities. Interviews just keep going, page after page, rehashing information you already knew."
"Tana French has gotten a lot of publicity for her latest book, The Searcher. I haven't read that, but I read this instead. It is a police procedural that takes place in Dublin--so you have to get use to to colloquialisms. As far as murder mysteries go, it's pretty good. The characters are will drawn and the plot has some surprises. A lot of people love Tana French, but as least as far as this book goes, I don't see what the fuss is about."
I didn’t like the main character in this book and the overly projected thought processes she went through in every situation. The dialectic writing style whilst adding to the authentic Irish setting of the squad but did make it hard at times to read. The plot flitted around like a butterfly in the summer and at times was as distracting as it was infuriating. It picked up towards the end but I endured this book rather than enjoyed it. 
"Eh. This was not my favorite of her books. They've been entertaining and absorbing without fail, and are excellent for listening to on car drives. My biggest complaint is that she doesn't confine lyrical writing to the omniscient narrator, but puts it in the mouths of her characters in situations where no normal person would talk like that. I'm a serial offender when it comes to using SAT vocab in everyday speech, but this goes far beyond that to having characters who are ostensibly gruff and emotionally suppressive wax poetic to each other about their pasts and inner feelings. This makes a passage that would be enjoyable to read on its own so jarring that it takes this persnickety reader out of the story.

Also, as usual for Tana French, the plot is imaginative in the extreme. This can be a good or bad thing depending on your mood and temperament, I guess."
"I enjoyed the plot and intrigue as to who murdered Ainslinn Murray. The main character, Detective Antoinette Conway of the Dublin Murder Squad is complex and Tana French merits praise for having developed a unique, flawed and relatable heroine. The author also includes poignant passages concerning family and relationships that prompt reader reflection. I did find the story redundant at times and felt there too much padding of details that slowed the pace. With respect to this, I was quite disappointed. "
"I felt this book was more about the detective than the actual case. Unfortunately the detective is not a likable character, IMO. I got tired of hearing all her negativity about everything. She was a good character in The Secret Place, but that wasn’t from her POV. I didn’t enjoy her POV at all. But overall the book still turned out ok. "
"tana french writes fantastically, her characters feel more than real and she writes interesting and funny dialogue and this book wasn’t an exception.

none of that guarantees me a great reading experience though and i was honestly a little bored for the first half because i felt like nothing happened. the plot did pick up in the last 40% tho so yay"
"Compelling plot and characters, but I wish an editor had helped her to tightening it up. There were a few too many overly long chapters/scenes. I have yet to accept that the age of book editors is gone and we are now in the age of unnecessarily lengthy novels. "
"Quick, entertaining crime fiction featuring a tough female protagonist. I've read ""The Secret Place"" by Tana French and have enjoyed both books ... they're perfect escapism for fans of mysteries/crime novels."
"I began by really enjoying this book but then it started to drag a little bit and all seemed a damp squib by the end.....probably not helped by Christmas being in the middle so my reading was all a bit stop start( eat,sleep,eat a bit more).I do like the feisty female detective though and on the strength of this will read more of the Dublin series...not sure why I began at No 6 though!"
"I enjoyed this book overall, but to be honest, I found the interviews to go on and on and on and on. I skimmed and moved ahead because it’s so much. I don’t need every single detail of every single interview in a case. "
"3.5* rounded down.

This features the abrasive Antoinette and the saintly Steve. I enjoyed it for a while, but then Antoinette's paranoia and persecution complex began to get to me. I skimmed the second half: the ending was OK, but I am glad to have reached the end of this series."
3.5! I really really liked this! Not my fav of hers but I loved the slow build and it was very entertaining! I did want a little bit more of a bigger ending though! I felt like the last 50 pages dragged.
"I LOVE Tana French but this was my least favorite. I suspected “whodunnit” early on and grew tired of the what ifs and maybes. Still, the writing style, language and characters kept me going back. The story was intriguing. Okay, maybe I give it a 3.5! "
"Honestly, this was not a favorite for me. It had a really slow build and most of the action happened in the last few chapters, so I found it hard to stay engaged in the beginning. Gonna try another Tana French book to see if it was just this one in particular that didn’t jive with me."
"This book was good, but maybe a little long. I think it took some unexpected twists, so that was enjoyable."
Her writing and characters are always well done. This storyline was exhausting and eventually tedious. Not my favorite of hers and I am a fan. 
"I love me a good Tana French mystery, but this one was a bit too slow and long with not as many twists and turns."
"This book felt more hopeless than some of the others (which were hardly laugh riots in themselves). It was fine, but I didn't enjoy it as much as some of the others."
"Tana French is perhaps my favorite crime writer. Her style is beautiful and literary without coming off as pretentious or sacrificing any of the important ""genre"" elements to craft a compelling mystery. I do think that I'm getting to know her tricks a bit too well, though; I had the killer pegged within the first fifty pages and kept pointing out the clues (both the ones that our MCs miss and the ones they misinterpret) from there on out. It's fun and satisfying to solve the mystery as reader before the characters do, but usually only just beforehand, not when the story's barely begun. Still a fun ride, though. French is excellent at dialogue and character development. After not having a clue who the killer was in The Secret Place until the very end, however, I was disappointed to have it all worked out so early in this novel. "
3.5 stars? Haven't read any of the series before but it stands alone well. Enjoyable even if the lead detective Conway can be a bit annoying at times. Hilda Fay's narration was great.
"The second Tana French book I really didn't get into. It was a good story, but the twist at the end wasn't really a twist. It was somewhat predictable for the most part. "
This book was a very long read. May not have finished it if it wasn't a book club book?? 
"Un peu trop de temps à se pencher sur les états d'âme de l'enquêtrice, à mon goût. L'intrigue est certes intéressante , mais elle est noyée dans les considérations psychologiques."
I had a hard time getting into this one. 
"I’m just not that into crime novels anymore. Tana French is the best author of the genre, IMO. "
This story took a long time to get told. I listened to this book and the Irish accents are challenging to listen to without drifting off for me. Not my favorite book by this author. Just thought it took too long to get to the point.
Wow. I think this book was in the bargain section for a reason. Not one of her best books. I couldn’t maintain loyalty or enjoy the characters. Bummer.
"Mark my words, Breslin is our next guy."
"“The air smells tasty and restless, all those places you could spend your evening, all the things waiting to happen inside those beckoning open doors.” "
I love a good Tana French to cleanse my palette of romances. I also want to move to Ireland now 
"*3.5

The plot was a 4, but the main character drove me crazy. That being said, she showed character growth and a growing self-awareness near the end of the story."
I would actually give it 3.5 stars. 
"3.5 ⭐️ kept me hooked all the way through, listened to this one and the narrator did a great job 👏 "
"My least favorite in this series, but still pretty good. "
Good detective story. Hated the main character though. Nothing mind-blowing.
3.5/5 I’ll never forgive her for the ending of in the woods but there’s some good stuff here 
"A good detective novel, although I sometimes got bored with the intricate detail, but nevertheless it kept me involved."
"Though I did enjoy this book, it seemed to take too long to get going and truly grab my interest."
A junior pair of Murder Squad detectives in Dublin investigate the death of a young woman while dealing with the interference from their own colleagues. The use of new words and phrases of Irish slang was very amusing. 
3.5 stars. 
"I'm not sure why I keep reading her books! I liked the first few, but the characters are getting annoying. A decent read."
Really well written and characters were enjoyable -the reason for 3 stars rather than 4 is felt it really slowed up at the end. Loved to listen to the book with a narrator sith an Irish accent. Fun
"I love French’s stories, but good Lord they go on and on forever. And don’t skip ahead
because there are little gems throughout the story that lends to its essence. I have to say, though, “so far” nothing compares to Faithful Place. That one has been the absolute best in my opinion."
"I love Tana French and this series, but this one was not my favorite."
3.5 stars. Not my favorite Tana French but definitely kept me guessing. Excuse me now while I go suspiciously eye every stranger passing by in my neighborhood...
"3.75
A good crime solve story. Can’t recommend to everyone because it has a lot of crude content. Not sure if that is real life detective work environment, but sad if that is the norm."
"Tana French writes incredibly plotted and paced intricate crime novels. The beauty of her craft is in the endings which, rather than being some “gotcha” finale with a surprising but unlikely denouement, are the logical conclusion to the case. French reaches for authenticity and achieves it. The final chapters may seem anticlimactic, but it is refreshing for an author to treat her readers with intelligence, which is the same way that she constructs her storylines. "
3.5 
Irish detective story. Not my cup of tea.
3.2
"Tana French has an amazing ability to craft real, believable characters and put them into dark mysteries. She is one of the few authors that has me checking off days on my calendar as a countdown to her next book. Compared to the first five books in the Dublin Murder Squad series though, The Trespasser is merely ""okay."" There seemed to be fewer layers to this story, less on the line, and a completely guessable mystery - the opposite of any other French book. And without the delicious tension from the mystery, French's lyrical writing was a little boring. The main character, Antoinette Conway, may be nuanced, but I had a hard time digesting her self-obsession. It's still a complex, interesting read, but Tana French has to be graded on a different level. And she's capable of better."
"Good story, but too much internal dialogue drags down the pace."
"Definitely a step up from the last installment, but the middle part dragged with extended interview sections. I felt like I was reading a script rather than a novel in parts."
"I will always read these, I think, because sometimes it's just that the only cure is a Tana French-y murder novel. It's a thing and you can count on it.

It wasn't my favorite one but I keep the faith. I don't really mind the places it breaks with tradition, and I liked Conway and Steve, and I liked the story being so deep inside the department that you're stuck in all the muck of getting things done. And even though I do like it when Tana French's detectives' heads completely explode (I mean, it's kind of the thing, is it not), I was happy for Conway to stay above water, except that there was some kind of prickle missing. I don't need her entire sense of sanity to be put in danger, but, I don't know, a little shark in the water is good for a protagonist in any novel. The one we get 
with the identity and meeting of her father is weird and out of balance. And, ultimately, the solve on our mystery felt way off, not its answer but its explanation, and these things are all about the backstory. In a mystery novel, technically, that's the important part we're all reading to get, so, that's not the best reward I've ever gotten.

I read this as eager escapism close in the wake of the US election. It worked, but trigger warning for this joke in the denouement:




Nothing's safe in 2016, even the Dublin Murder Squad.

(Okay, especially the Dublin Murder Squad.)"
"After reading Tana's French's first novel, In the Woods, I was eager to read the second, The Likeness, which is one of the few novels I've read recently that I 'scanned' through to the end so I could say I finished it—I found the basic premise just too absurd. So, that is why I ducked the next novels and jumped to her latest, The Trespasser, in-part driven by the many positive reviews. And there are many positives—sharp language, well-developed characters (albeit that the urine-ready, bad-guy in the Murder squad is never explored), and a plot that is tortuous enough to keep you thinking and intrigued. Why only 3-stars? Because it is so, so, so long—page after page of interrogation dialogue occupy the last 100 pages—that it was a relief to finish, even if some of the loose ends hadn't been tied up."
"I really liked the characters, and the book was filled with one fricking storyline after another. Even though it was good, it was still about 50 pages too long! Here is a go at it: Young English girl has a taxi cab driving father mysteriously disappear out of her and her mom's lives. The whole time afterwards, as she is growing up, she fantasizes about what really happened to him. In this fantasy world she becomes a bit stunted, taking care of her mom, and not moving on with life. As a young adult, after her mother' death, she decides to take one more go at locating dad. It is at this point she discovers that her father had moved away with a younger woman, but in actuality he has recently passed on from a heart condition. To make matters worse she discovers that the Detective in Missing Persons had located her father, but chose not to let her and her mom know. He was trying to protect their feelings. Big mistake! She plots her revenge against the Detective - who now works on the Murder Squad. She invents an even bigger fantasyland, which doesn't end well. The author weaves an intriguing tale, worth reading."
"I'm in the minority on this one, I think. It won't stop me from reading other French novels, because she's one of the best procedural writers working. Her attention to character and her prose style are marvelous, but for me this wasn't as strong as other books.

Two things got on my nerves. First, I didn't really enjoy Antoinette Conway's point of view. I'm sympathetic to the idea of working in a hostile environment, and interested in reading about how someone copes with that, but the chip on Conway's shoulder is so big (and in such stark contrast to her relationship with Moran, who can seemingly do no wrong), that her anger wore me out. Maybe if more of the hazing and bigotry had actually happened during this story's timeline instead of as generalized memories, it would have created more empathy. I also had trouble working up much empathy for the victim when the only thing we learn about her in the early going is that she intentionally played emotional games with the man she was dating.

But the bigger problem to me here is the pacing. Normally I love procedural detail, but here a lot of that detail was bland and I had lost some interest before the case got moving."
"I’d give this one a 3.5 if that was possible - the story was GOOD, lots of twists and turns. Had me guessing the culprit until well in and wondering the motive even longer. Even when you are almost sure you know who dunnit your not sure why and so not 100 percent sure.

But the main character was awful - I couldn’t find anything about her I could like or even feel for, remotely. She was so negative and resentful - a lot of hatred bottled up inside. Her partner you could like but half ways through she manages to turn you on him. I’m glad I pushed through it bc it was a great story/plot but she made it very difficult."
"Detective Antoinette Conway does not fit in with her colleagues in the Dublin Murder Squad. She is harassed and doesn't trust any of them. Although Conway is impulsive and suspicious of others, she has a good relationship with her partner, Stephen Moran. Conway, with Moran assisting, finds herself the chief investigator in the murder of Aislinn Murray. They are both displeased, however, to have a third person working with them closely--seasoned detective Breslin. Conway and Moran don't trust Breslin, and throughout the case keep secret some of the information that they have gathered. The prime suspect is Rory Fallon, who had a dinner date at Aislinn's home the night she was killed. Is Rory the killer in a lover's spat gone wrong, or does Breslin's pushing for Rory's arrest indicate a cover-up? In this leisurely-paced sixth book of the Dublin Murder Squad series, French re-teams Conway and Moran from her previous book, The Secret Place. Unfortunately, the mystery did not grip me, and I found Conway to be pretty one-dimensional and an uninteresting character."
"3.75 stars
I enjoyed this book. It was really more of a methodical, literary crime fiction than a fast-paced thriller. The book spends a lot of time in the main character's headspace. There is a great deal of introspection and reflection. The middle of the story got a bit bogged down for me in its vast array of swirling theories. The main detectives on the case spent more than a fair share of time and pages chasing possible theories, often without evidence...spinning scenarios in their head. Also, I found the main character quite dislikable, though to her credit, she grew throughout the story, mainly towards the end, and that was satisfying to see. There were a couple of antagonist characters who are extremely annoying, and hence difficult to read, though they served a purpose. I was pleased with conclusion, and French was really pretty brilliant and the way she crafted the novel in that all the parts, including the slower portions, were there for a purpose. So while it is not a book you can fly through, in my opinion, it was an interesting and worthwhile read."
"A French novel has become its own brand and it never fails to satisfy the murder mystery hunger. Admittedly though, as much of a page-turner as The Trespasser is, it's my least favorite French novel. Her earlier novels have always left me with a uniquely haunting feeling which sadly seems to be lacking in this book. French has a beautiful way of characterizing the Irish landscape into her stories, but The Trespasser is focused mainly in the Irish suburbs+the police station (the Guard station? not sure what the Irish equivalent is). This seems to be the base for which that eerie undertone of towering trees and dark woods is missing.

But as always, French succeeds in seamlessly weaving together the story of the vic, the case and the lead Detective. As the case unfolds and the vic's story begins to layer, the lead D's own enigmatic layers are pulled back to reveal the transparent connection between the two stories."
"3.5 stars. This book had some good parts but more than anything I felt like I was reading hypothetical situations and interviews. I guess I wish more actually happened in the book instead of everything being said/done as part of an interview or a discussion in the squad room. Also, at times I found the connections to the past causing these repercussions a little ridiculous.

That being said I love Tana French's writing which got me through some of the longer drawn out parts where my brain was screaming for something to just happen already. The Irish accent and language and even general attitude comes through so well in her books. I always want to grab a pint or a ""cuppa"" with my mates after reading them, yeah?

Overall a good book. Long in parts and not her best of this series but good enough."
"Slow and probably my least favorite Tana French book so far. Because of all the conversations and interviews in this book, I felt like the story was more told instead of shown. I had to take a lot of leaps of faith with the lead detectives, and many things felt to tidy. I found Antoinette interesting but very hard to like throughout the book. I felt she was mostly a product of her own overthinking and prejudices (even though it is obvious she has a difficult time as the only female on her squad).

I did like where the book left off, however, and am anxious to see how the ending of this book will affect the next one. French's writing is always stellar, and I think her writing really carried me through this book. She writes excellent female characters, and Antoinette's growth and introspection was one of my favorite parts of the book. I look forward to the next one!"
"Murder Squad detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephan Moran, investigating what they expect to be another by-the-numbers domestic case, find themselves embroiled in an anything-but-neat lovers’ quarrel gone bad.
In addition to the investigation, Antoinette is dealing with harassment from the other members of the squad. Are they simply trying to get rid of her or are there darker forces at work?

With the narrative focused on the characters and the dynamics of the Murder Squad, the pace was sluggish at times. And while Antoinette had good reason to be grumpy, she was not particularly likeable and her paranoia ultimately grates on the reader, making it difficult to empathize with her situation. Readers may be tempted to mutter “Grow up” to the detectives. Ultimately, this tale is a disappointment.
"
"This book in the series fell a little flat for me and was a tad difficult to get through. Disappointing, as I absolutely LOVED every other Dublin Murder Squad installment, and had to slow myself down while reading them to get every ounce of enjoyment from her beautiful writing and storytelling abilities. Not so here. The pages dragged. The protagonist was blah: angry and irrationally antagonistic, without developing her character or showing the why behind her disdain. A few plot points were glossed over (her relationship with her ma? The dad's brief appearance? Her partner? Her boss?) None seemed quite fully developed. Sigh. Really wanted more. I guess I'll just look forward to some redemption in a future Book Seven. Insert sad face here. "
"Much more of a police procedural than Ms. French's other books. The convoluted versions of the murder that the detectives come up with seem endless, and become tedious after the 4th or 5th. Like reading Dashiell Hammett, when you've become convinced of a theory, then seen that theory blown up, over and over again--after a while you just stop caring.

The ending was intriguing and rewarding. But were all 450 pages needed to get to that ending?

It seemed that Ms. French was trying to weave a common thread through several stories in the book, related to the title. But the connections were very tenuous, and the theme pretty lightweight.

Ms. French is a wonderful writer, but the plotting of this book was a disappointment."
"This is a good police procedural. The main character is complex and likable, and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep a veteran reader happy. Still, I expect more than a procedural from Tana French. I just can't help it, after In the Woods, The Likeness, and The Secret Place.

Those books drew me into the eerie worlds she created so well, I wanted be in them even if it did mean that I'd probably end up dead. In those books, the mysteries stretched beyond the murders themselves, which was really what made them special.

Still, I'd rather read this than anything with a letter or number in the title, and for diehard French fans like me, there's probably enough here to keep you happy."
"A good portion of my TV watching in the late 2000’s/early 2010’s was devoted to binging on police procedurals and this book made me a little nostalgic for that period of my life. I found the main character extremely annoying for most of the first half of the book – judgmental and suuuper negative (although you can somewhat see that her circumstances contributed to this gruff persona). The murder investigation was interesting and although you could figure somewhat early who the perp(s) is/are, the motive was not clear, and it was fun to get in the minds of the two handling detectives. Although I didn’t 100% love the book I enjoyed the ride and will read more books from French’s Dublin Murder Squad (The Trespasser is the 6th in the series)."
"I enjoyed the central mystery but the main character is so irritating and the story was bogged down by too many lengthy side plots that weren't relevant enough to warrant the padding. It felt very over written. A shame because I really enjoy her central storylines.

Even the horrible people are usually so engaging, but I didn't much care for Conway in the last book and I liked her even less in this one. Glad I read it but I hope the next book is more tightly edited. I thought the O'Kelly and McCann scenes were some of the best in the book. I also am guessing Fleas for the next lead. I still really like Tana French and will be in line for the next book."
"A character driven police procedural. Antoinette made an interesting heroine, complex and flawed. She is a bit brash with plenty of attitude. But she has her reasons, being a woman of color in a job dominated by white men. Antoinette was the best part of the book for me. The case Antoinette and Steve worked definitely went in unexpected directions. The mystery is solved quietly, a bit anti-climactically, in my opinion. I tend to prefer a more exciting Mystery/Thriller type of book. But this was a well thought out story with characters that do come to life. If you are a Tana French fan, you are likely to enjoy this."
"I love love love Tana French, and I enjoyed a lot of this book - but that said, it might be my least favorite of her's so far. I think at the heart of it, I just didn't feel Antoinette. I had mixed feelings about her in general, and often found her hard to root for or even like. However, I am still very glad I read the book, and I still eagerly anticipate her next. If you've never read Tana French, start with In the Woods and work your way through, in order. (Broken Harbor is my favorite). You won't be disappointed."
"Eh. Another one I wasn't as big a fan of...again, still good writing...but Moran and Conway just fell flat for me compared to some of French's previous narrators.
Conway was kinda annoying, her ""come to Jesus"" at the end (regarding the squad) a little too corny, Breslin more a caricature than a character, the plot a little jumpy, Conway's father's appearance pointless...etc.
However- still enjoyable to read! But not quite on the same level as French's first four...hoping this is the last we see of Conway and Moran; we need a fresh voice/partner pairing!"
"No esperen grandes dosis de acción. Como es ya su marca registrada, la autora respeta las unidades de Tiempo, Lugar y Acción. Aquí es para disfrutar de la lectura especialmente en los enfrentamientos psicológicos entre policías y durante los interrogatorios donde la autora logra momentos de altísima tensión.
Pero lamentablemente eso ocurre recién en la segunda parte del libro, para no escribir a llegar al último tercio. La primera parte es más descriptiva. Es una presentación excesivamente reiterativa de los lugares, de los personajes y de las paranoias de su principal protagonista."
"Another of French's intense Irish mysteries, this one centers on Antoinette Conway, new member of the elite Dublin Murder Squad, who feels very much an outsider when she and her partner Steve are assigned to solve the murder of a young woman. Conway senses that the solution presented seems too easy, and keeps digging until she comes across a cold case and an accompanying revenge plot, exposing a fellow officer's treachery."
"I love Tana French and will continue to eagerly await and read her books - but I do think this one is the weakest of the series by far, so far. The story largely took place in the narrator's own head, hanging on a lot of speculation and without very much real action or developments occurring. So was disappointed. Hoping for better next time. But I do love herabilitt to paint very realistic characters that you feel you just know. "
"As a stand-alone mystery, The Trespasser is certainly a decent read. A solid 3 stars, perfectly engaging. But compared to Tana French's previous novels, this was a disappointment. All her other novels are so astonishing and atmospheric, and in contrast The Trespasser had so much internal dialogue and a nearly trite plot twist.

Still a worthwhile read, but a letdown after the first 5 in the series."
"I liked the book and would probably give it a 3.5 star rating. I've read all the Tana French Dublin squad books and I think this was definitely one of the slower ones. I thought it was well written and interesting, but it did drag on a bit longer than it needed to. There were certain things and theories that I felt were pretty obvious early on, but it took the entire book for the main detectives to get there. Either way, it was still satisfying to see the realization in the end."
"Initially, Antoinette was not my favorite Tana French character - so tough, unsympathetic, and angry. But French does again what she does best - fully evolving characters who matter more to you than the plot. French shows us how the stories we tell ourselves alter our interpretation of reality, often to our detriment. "
"Normally I love Tana French, but this book was harder for me to get through than the others. It clung closely to the repetitious, dialogue-driven nature of a real investigation -- as did Broken Harbour -- but it was also very straightforward, without the twists one expects from her. A decent book, but not my favorite of hers."
"I slogged through the first 50 or so pages. So much of it was Conway thinking, overthinking everything. I almost quit, but I persevered. The last four or five chapters moved along at a good pace.

I read Into the Woods and was not enamored with it. I only picked this up because it took place in Ireland and Anne Bogel included it in a group with Rebecca and 13th Tale."
"Disappointed. Each of her books is more generic than the last. What happened to the Tana French who wrote books so tensely, masterfully suspenseful I was reluctant to read them alone at night--In the Woods, The Likeness, Broken Harbour? This was just an overly talky cop buddy story where the guy we suspected for 2/3 of the book finally confessed. She's lost me as a fan."
"Great continuation of the Dublin Murder Squad. I took off one star because I wish that Antoinette was not so paranoid. However, the in depth interviews and characterizations of the different detectives made up for that. This reminded me of the first book, Into the Woods, which is the reason I was drawn in the series in the first place."
"I have loved all of Tana French's previous books. Well developed characters and plot - in addition to a solid mystery. This book just did not live up to the previous ones. In fact, I surprisingly found it hard to finish. About two younger murder detectives given what appears to be a domestic murder case."
"This was a surprisingly enjoyable novel, kind of a complement to The Secret Place, which pairs Steve and Antoinette for the first time told from Steve's pov. The Trespasser is all Antoinette, and in parts, it is a rough ride given her embattled life perspective. Great twist about 3/4 through the book when everything suddenly becomes clearer than the murky misdirections of most of the novel."
The lone female detective in the Dublin Murder Squad is assigned a presumptive domestic dispute murder. Older detective presses for a fast arrest. but she and her partner have doubts. Lengthy and somewhat tedious procedural follows. This not the sort of story that makes want to stay up late at night to finish.
"My least favorite of the series

Slightly less than 3 stars. Not as compelling as the first several Dublin Murder Squad books, and with a main character which did not feel as authentic"
"Not my favorite Tana French. Slow going with tons of dialogue, the story really wasn't all that interesting. Too much repetition and whining about being the only woman in the murder squad as well as the suspense feeling forced made me want this book to be 100 pages shorter."
"If it has one star I liked it a lot
If it has two stars I liked it a lot and would recommend it
If it has three stars I really really liked it a lot
If it has four stars I insist you read it
If it has five stars it was life changing"
"Audio book that mark and I listened to while traveling two days from Venice, FL. My actual rating is 3.5 stars for a really good plot that had me hooked right from the beginning. But, I found the main character's personality inconsistent and the whole story took just a little too long to tell..."
"I generally like Tana French's books, but I was having trouble getting into this one. I've been feeling raw because of the political climate here in post-2016-election-US, and the rampant misogyny in this ""fiction"" was hitting too hard/too close to home. It was distressing and pissing me off! "
"Three and one-half stars. I am a fan of T. French and I've liked all her mysteries, but this was a little long for the genre and a little too enmeshed in details. Also I'll never totally get Irish slang."
"I usually love French's novels, this one wasn't her best. The first 50% of the book dragged and was not very engaging. It picked up for the last half of the book, so I was glad I stuck with it, but not her best."
"This is a difficult rating for me. Most of this book was excellent, but there was a stretch in the middle that was really slow and tedious. Except for that, this would have easily been a 4-star book. I'll probably check out other books in the series."
"I am a big Tana French fangirl but while this mystery was a lot better than her last one, it still didn't do it for me. Don't worry, I'll be back for the next release, pestering my mother to buy it in Ireland before it gets published in the U.S."
"I liked this book & wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars. I liked the unfolding mystery & thought that the underlying theme of a woman working in a male dominated / hostile work environment was apropos for today's issues. Not Ms French's best (that is Faithful Place in my opinion), but a good read."
A who-done-it set in Ireland (which was cool). She's got a huge chip on her shoulder and you wonder the whole time if that's going to play into it. It was not a very interesting mystery to me. I did like that I was able to get it on audio and listen while cleaning the church. That helps.
I kept reading mostly because I wanted to know how it ends and because I liked the atmosphere. The story spends so much time in the head of the protagonist I felt dizzy at some point. In other words - a tedious read.
I had trouble reading this book the 1st copy I had the font was too small so got a copy from the library but it was so drawn out I have enjoyed previous books of hers so struggled on the last quarter of the book got more exciting and it had a good ending
"Maybe i am just not into interrogation drama, but most of this book dragged for me and I thought the plot seemed unlikely and silly. The characters also felt flat to me and didn’t really hold my interest."
"Irish, literary, noir-ish, police procedural, in which a fanciable, twenty-something, woman was found dead at home from a face punch. Dublin Murder Squad Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran investigate. Prime suspect, the new boyfriend wasn’t a ‘good fit’. Also, why was the investigation being steered by detectives within their own murder squad?

My audiobook version was 20-hours long. It had a US 2016 copyright. A dead tree copy would be 464-pages.

Tana French is an American-Irish writer and theatrical actress. She has written nine novels standalone and in her Dublin Murder Squad series. This was the sixth book in the Murder Squad series. I have read several of the books in this series. The last being The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad, #5) (my review).

Narrator was Hilda Fay. She did a remarkably good job. This was abetted by being Irish, and the story being mostly the inner-monolog and dialog of the protagonist Detective Antoinette Conway. In addition, Fay had enough ‘voices’ for the other female characters and the men most frequently providing dialog. A few extra male voices would have helped. However, her performance enhanced the ear-reading experience.

It’s recommended to have read the previous book in the Dublin Murder Squad series The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad, #5) before attempting this book. That would provide additional context on the investigating detectives and the Murder Squad.

French’s Dublin Murder Squad series has grown on me over time. I’ve liked each subsequent book in the series more than the last. I liked the previous book in the series better than this one, but that was more due to an excellent audio narration, and the taste of the paranormal not found in this story.

This story had a simpler, single plot structure than French’s previous Murder squad stories. Conway heads up the murder investigation of 26-year-old, Aislinn Murray. Her's is the sole POV. She and Moran were the newest members of the Murder squad. Conway, the only woman on the squad, was having a rough time with its The Boy’s Club atmosphere.

The beautiful, blonde was found dead in her home from a knockout punch to the face, which bounced her head off a stone fireplace. In domestic violence against women, its almost always by the hands of an intimate partner. However, Aislinn’s alibi-less, bookish, new boyfriend, doesn’t work with Conway and Moran as her murderer. (They had never been intimate either.) This was despite heavy pressure, from senior colleagues on the Murder Squad and a preponderance of circumstantial evidence that could put him away. Expanding the investigation beyond The Usual Suspect, resulted in roadblocks and warnings toward continuing in a different direction.

French’s writing was smart and literate. In places it was funny. The descriptions were good, although a tad literarily flowery. There was a small amount of repetition. The very noir, “Bunny boiler” being most notable. Action sequences were good, although this was not an action thriller. The largest, best part, of the story was the well-executed dialog, particularly in the interrogations and inner dialog of Conway. The tearing down of the suspect’s in the interrogations was brutal. The author’s red herrings mostly decoyed me. 
I thought the murderer was part of the investigation, and was truly surprised the victim was a femme fatale.

This story contained sex, no serious drugs, and no rock'n roll music. Note my criteria for noirish mystery success require that trifecta. Consensual sex was discussed as having happened using peculiar Irish euphemisms. All sex was heterosexual. Conway’s sexuality, didn’t ring true to me, despite other aspects of her personality being well developed. Alcohol was consumed, but not to excess. There were no music references of any type.

There was almost no violence. Violence was physical. Body count was one (1).

Whether French’s novels contain a paranormal aspect is debatable. I felt the series’ first novel In the Woods (my review) to be strongly that way. Later books in the series less so. The Secret Place had a smattering of it. This book had none.

French writes novels about The Feels masquerading as police procedurals. Murder was secondary in purpose to the story. This story included: friendship, loyalty, misogyny and betrayal within the Garda Síochána of the murder squad. It was mostly a journey of self-discovery for Conway. I wondered how much of Conway was the author? This book gave me a good dose of the police procedural that slowly revealed itself as noir mystery. I liked this book, but it was not the best within the series. I thought the The Secret Place was a better Conway and Moran story."
"I think I'm done with Tana French. I enjoyed the book, and the main character, but the writing felt over wrought for the plot."
"I really enjoy French's writing, and this one started off a little slow for me, it was kind of relentlessly dark to begin with, but I ended up really enjoying it and the storyline."
"3.5. Mostly, because I love the gaffer."
The writing style was very detailed. The story was good. I just prefer a storyline that grabs me. Meh.
I liked it-how can you not like a novel by Tana French? But a couple of her other ones are still the gold standard to me.
I would like to give it 3.5 stars. I like a good mystery but the book was far too long. 
"This book has huge problems with pacing, but I enjoyed it well enough. "
I listened to the audio until disc 15 and then switched to the book. I usually really like her on audio but this one went way too slowly. I'm sorry. 
"Surprising and compelling. A surprise! This was my first Tana French, and yet, I was not lost in the series. "
"I preferred French's other books. This one was still a complex and satisfying procedural, but I kept looking at my progress thinking, ""There's how much still left??"" Very long."
"Did not realize this was the 6th book in a series, but it stands alone well."
A bit anticlimactic for me. Eye strain and a big ol’ eh🤷‍♀️
"3.5, not my favorite of hers but love the series and the author!"
"3+ A good story, a bit to wordy at times : )

My first Tana French novel. There will be more.









"
"Maybe 3 1/2 stars. Held my attention, but not one of her best."
"Avis L’invité sans visage Tana French

Inspectrice à la criminelle qui doit faire face à un monde d’hommes. Personne ne lui fait de cadeaux car c’est une femme, donc un sacré sexisme, machisme mais aussi car elle a des origines différentes. De plus, son caractère entier ne joue pas pour elle. Mais pour y arriver, elle ne doit pas se laisser marcher sur les pieds. Ce roman révèlera vraiment à Antoinette ce qu’elle vaut réellement, en qui elle peut avoir confiance, si elle peut changer d’avenir.

Je peux vous dire que je me suis forcée pour lire ce roman. Je n’ai pas pour habitude de délaisser un roman qui ne me plait pas pour laisser une chance à l’auteur de me faire, un tant soit peu vibrer. Pour cause de départ de Mademoiselle, je lui ai laissé la Kobo pour qu’elle puisse l’emmener. Il me manquait donc à lire une centaine de pages. Est-ce que cet interlude a pu donner plus d’ampleur ? Il y a eu un moment, vers la page 150, où je me suis dit, ça y est, c’est parti. Sauf que c’est pratiquement vite retombé comme un soufflet. Et la reprise a été aussi dure. Ce n’est que mon avis de lectrice. Je suis une amatrice de policiers, polars et autres thrillers, certains avec des dimensions psychologiques. Là, je n’ai rien trouver outre cette enquête, vraiment trop longue où les possibilités s’éliminent au fur et à mesure. Les questionnements d’Antoinette, sa paranoïa, auraient pu vraiment être intéressants. Sauf que non, je ne me suis pas sentie concernée. La pression ne monte jamais.

Il faut dire que l’histoire ne prête pas à une montée de pression. Un appel pour cas de violence conjugale. La mort d’une jeune femme. Un petit ami très vite accusé car il ne dit pas tout. Une meilleure amie qui donne un indice dans lequel ne s’engouffrent pas Antoinette et Steeve. Entre eux deux, c’est une véritable partie de ping-pong verbal pour éliminer au fur et à mesure les indices. Font-ils fausse route ? Sont-ils vraiment aidés ? Les interrogatoires menés sont les parties les plus intéressantes du roman. Le lecteur voit que la qualité est là et quels que soientt les enquêteurs en place. Quel que soit le milieu, professionnel ou pas, les bleus sont plutôt attirés par ceux qui ont du charisme, qui répandent de fausses informations. En effet, ils ne veulent pas être laissés de côté, surtout lorsque leur héros a plus d’expérience dans la boîte qu’eux, qui a fait ses preuves. Comme dans toute enquête, le binôme est présent. Ici, c’est Antoinette et Steeve qui doit sa place car Antoinette l’a demandé. Malgré les coups et le caractère d’Antoinette, le binôme fonctionne très bien, il est complémentaire.

Je ne mets pas en cause les qualités de Tana French mais je suis vraiment passée à côté. Ce roman ne m’a pas du tout correspondu. Je ne connais Tana French que de nom, même si j’ai déjà lu beaucoup de bien en ce qui concerne cet auteur. Si ce premier essai n’est pas réussi, peut-être que les suivants le seront.

Je remercie Calmann Lévy et NetGalley pour cette sélection.

Résumé L’invité sans visage Tana French

Steeve et Antoinette se connaissent depuis l’école de police. Maintenant, ils sont à la Criminelle. Ils sont appelés pour un cas de violence conjugale. Ils découvrent une jeune femme morte.

Ils doivent faire affaire avec un autre inspecteur dont Antoinette se méfie. Ils essaient de prendre de l’avance dans leur enquête."
"""And me, I was so busy bracing myself to fight anyone who was out to sink me or own me or generally use me as his very own dollhouse dolly, it never occurred to me that this might not be about me to begin with.""

In this book, Detective Antoinette Conway (who first appeared in The Secret Place) wrestles with the antipathy toward her as the only Black and female member of the Dublin Murder Squad. She tries to tell who's setting her up and whether anyone is truly on her side, up to and including her partner, Detective Steve Moran. She also comes to grips with the trauma her father inflicted on her when he abandoned her as a child.

Oh, and she sometimes works on solving a murder. When she does, she finds an ingenious way to achieve justice.

Like the other books in the series, this one takes a secondary character from the previous volume and places her at the center. We saw Antoinette from Steve's perspective before; now, we hear her own thoughts and the fears she won't show to any of the boys in the Squad. Her head is a claustrophobic place to inhabit, and without enough editing, this novel keeps us inside her head for many more pages than needed.

I'd think author Tana French was making light of the sexism and racism that Antoinette faces and telling her to buckle up and wear her big girl trousers...except for two things. One is that old saying, ""Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean no one's really out to get you."" It's not the whole Squad, but she does have enemies, and pretending they didn't exist would be just as dangerous as looking for enemies everywhere.

The other is that our hero is actually a lot like the murder victim. Both have terrible unresolved issues about their fathers. Both can come up with long-term strategies, put on an act, and stay in character as long as it takes to get what they want. (This doubling is one of Tana French's repeated motifs: you see it as early in the series as The Likeness, and she uses it to allow the character--and push us--to reflect on who they really are.) The victim/revenge artist is a young white woman, and by moving back and forth between the story of Aislynn Murray and that of Antoinette Conway, we see them both as complex people, neither wholly likeable nor admirable, but very understandable.


Antoinette finds a way to make the Squad her future. It's not clear that this series has anywhere new to go, however. French has written two non-series books since The Trespasser came out, and that may be just as well. The Dublin Murder Squad is a considerable achievement, and if it is now complete, I am happy I've read all the books."
"I'm not a regular reader of mysteries/police procedurals, and it took me a while to appreciate The Trespasser. On the surface it's a classic locked room murder mystery - a pretty young woman is found dead in her perfectly clean home while getting ready for a dinner date, with no signs of forced entry or a scuffle. Our heroine must catch the killer, with the victim's life seemingly as empty of clues as her spotless home, and her colleagues on the squad seemingly sabotaging her efforts every step of the way.

Narrator/protagonist Antoinette Conway is a classic unlikeable heroine, and she doesn't give a fat fuck if you or anyone else likes her. She's tough as nails and self-reliant as fuck-all (as she would say). If she had a theme song, it would be, ""I am a rock / I am an island."" She doesn't need friends or lovers, and as far as she's concerned virtually everyone on the squad is an enemy. But if you're not in her corner, there's something wrong with you. She's been dying to make the murder squad for years, but now that she's here, she finds herself in a no-woman's-land where the boys all seem to be against her and the harassment is relentless. Her disposition, never that charming to begin with, has turned as prickly as a constipated hedgehog.

What's funny to me is that inside her mind, Conway lives on a knife edge of imminent violence. She almost can't get through a conversation with another person without visualizing hitting or kicking them, she's so fed up with people. The effort of restraining her frustration has her coiled as tight as a spring, and in the immortal words of Ferris Bueller, she's wound so tight that if you stuck a lump coal up her ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond. But by the end of the story, the number of physical fights she's actually started is… zero. Either she's a champ at restraining all this rage, or she's all talk.

The story's pacing and structure remind me of an Iain Banks novel in the way that it builds slowly and requires some patience in the first half as we pile up the often-irrelevant details of an investigation. You won't necessarily appreciate until near the end the way it's all unfolding like an elaborate puzzle box, where the puzzle isn't just the murder investigation itself, but the relationships between all the characters. 
I was a bit disappointed, though, by the way Conway's own missing father was played. He struck me as a bit of a Chekov's gun - dropped there to draw the eye, but not adding enough to the story. His arrival midway through is obviously a chance for Conway to assert herself and insist that she deal with her past on her own terms. And the parallel to Aislynn's situation is painfully clear. I admit I was really hoping she might learn something from Aislynn's situation, where Aislynn didn't learn the truth about her gone dad until it was too late to forge any kind of relationship with him. But even if Conway's decision is still, ""I'm never going to see him again and I don't want him in my life,"" I would have liked to see her make that decision at the end of the book in a thoughtful way based on her experience with this case, rather than simply having a knee-jerk reaction to him.

It also in a weird way reminds me of Frank Herbert's Dune and The Dosadi Experiment. The crucial scenes all focus on Conway interviewing (or interrogating, you might say) witnesses and are painstakingly fleshed out with every twitch of an eyebrow and every subtle change of posture. Conway and her partner practice the high art of getting a witness who doesn't legally have to say anything to spill his guts and provide the information that will crack the case wide open. They analyze microexpressions crossing the face in milliseconds, communicate with each other in a glance, and change strategy in an instant. And in THE crucial scene, the crux of the story, they match their skills against the ultimate adversary… one of their own, older and more experienced, who's been interviewing witnesses since they were spot-faced teenagers, and knows every trick in their book better than they do themselves. In that sense, it's a very cerebral book. There are no car chases, no shootouts, and no one other than the victim gets killed or even roughed up. The ""action"" is all people sitting around tables and talking, but doing it at an incredibly subtle and sophisticated level.

Audio Notes: The text is very Irish, loaded with Irish idioms and slang, and narrator Hilda Fey dials up the Irishness until it's t'ick as a mornin' fog on the Liffey. And it's not any high-falutin' castle Irish either… it's down-dirty Dublin street talk. It's very well done but it can take a bit of extra concentration."
"Three and a half stars from me!

I didn't start off reading Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, of which there are now six books but I read the fifth book, The Secret Place quite recently and enjoyed it so when Richard and Judy picked the sixth book, The Trespasser for their Summer Book Club here in the UK I was pleased to carry on where I had left off. I am now planning to re-visit the series from the beginning at some point when that pesky TBR pile is under better control! The Trespasser is Irish crime fiction at its absolute finest and I really enjoy the rather different writing that characterises this authors style. I have to say, I don't think some people will get on with it, it's quite a slow burner of a narrative, like The Secret Place but I think if you can push past the slower parts of the narrative you might be pleasantly surprised.

Our protagonist and returning Detective Antoinette Conway is in her dream job, the Murder Squad with partner in crime, Detective Stephen Moran who assisted Antoinette and helped her crack a tricky case in the previous novel, The Secret Place. They make an excellent team but are faced with further intrigue and puzzlement when the latest case lands on their desks. At first, it looks like a standard domestic violence/possible manslaughter incident however things aren't quite adding up for Antoinette and Stephen. It seems all a bit too easy to blame Aislinn Murray's lover, Rory for her untimely demise but there are many things going on behind the scenes that make the detectives questions whether there isn't something a lot deeper and darker going on. Antoinette is already on shaky ground with the majority of officers in the Murder Squad but the question is, can she risk everything she has worked for in pursuit of justice?

As I mentioned before, unlike a lot of crime fiction you see nowadays, I found The Trespasser rather different in that the plot wasn't necessarily action-packed. It seemed to have a much deeper and intricate focus on the characters, their back stories, their lives and aspirations and the darker, more gritty side of the police force. I wouldn't call it a page turner to be perfectly honest, in the normal sense of the word but it did keep me turning the pages for different reasons. I became more invested in the characters and what they had done, felt, were going to do in the future and, as a result I felt better connected with the story as a whole. I really love reading about Antoinette as a character, she isn't afraid to say what she thinks,  is independent, takes no nonsense and in The Trespasser we get to see a potentially much softer, troubled and more vulnerable side of her character which only made me more intrigued to carry on with the series if she appears in the next novel from Tana French. So to sum up, if you're in the mood for a slower, more considered crime fiction style, this definitely gets my seal of approval!

"*3.5 stars*

I'm fully in. I thought I could just read one or two of French's books, get my murder mystery thrill and call it a day, but that's just not happening. With this one down, I'm ordering the other two I haven't read tomorrow--yes I know I've been reading them completely out of order--and I'm telling myself I should wait and not read them all at once, but I doubt that will happen. French's writing, and stories have a way of grabbing you by the collar and not letting go until the final page. They're so easy to read, and engrossing the whole way through, and I'm having a great time with them.

That said, while I did have a fun time with this one, and like the others I read it very quickly, there were some parts that I didn't love. Some of them I can't particularly pinpoint, and probably just comes down to purely subjective taste. I do think that the middle of this slogged a bit compared to the others, just in terms of getting a lot of runaround rather than actual progression. Although I thought the characters were much more fleshed out in this rather than in Broken Harbor, which is the one I just finished previously, I liked the progression of the mystery better in that one, which again is just a personal preference. Additionally, a very similar red herring / plot element was used in both this and Broken Harbor, although contextually they were very different. Flipping that around again, I much preferred the ending to this, as the ending to Broken Harbor was one of my biggest issues, and not even comparatively, I really liked the ending here.

I had a hard time figuring out if I 'liked' Conway or not. She was quite obviously meant to be unlikable, with her flaws being pointed out by many other characters in the novel, and I appreciated that, but I also felt like she was a bit archetypal. Additionally, her development felt a little too abrupt a little too late for me. I loved her banter with Moran though, and thought it was really fun to see them work. Per usual, loved French's literary bent writing, and man does she have a way at ending chapters in such a melancholy way.

All in all, although there was just something off with this one that held me back from liking it as much as I could have, I still had a really good time with it, and I'm excited to read more! French has a way of writing exactly what I look for in a mystery, and I’m learning that regardless of if it’s a favorite that will stick with me like The Likeness, or not, I know I’ll have an entertaining time with it regardless."
"This is a tough one, because I did consume this book almost in one sitting. But I think I had two main problems: Conway and the wild goose chase that she and Moran go on about halfway through the book. I can see that Conway grating on the reader was probably on purpose, but the wild goose chase was just annoying. It led to nothing, was pointless, and just made both Conway and Moran idiots for running around on that when they should have been focusing on other things.

So back to Conway. I can understand why she is the way she is, but holy smokes her constant negativity and her perception that everyone hated her and wanted her gone really exhausted me after a while. Even after getting TWO reality checks (one guy even told her flat-out why the other guys were skittish around her) she still stubbornly dug her heels in and assumed everyone wanted to see her crash and burn. I know that sexist and racist stuff happens, but when it was all said and done, it was really just one asshole.

The other issue was the wild goose chase. There was way too much time spent on that to ultimately lead to nothing. I knew right away that Rory wasn't their guy and the others pushing Conway and Moran onto it was suspicious as hell, I figured then it had to be dirty cop involvement. It was actually interesting that this book took a ACAB approach to the plot. How it all wrapped up was pretty good as well. I'm really glad it wasn't all covered up and poor Rory didn't take the fall. But I could've done with that page-wasting wild goose chase.

The mystery itself was pretty decent. I liked the theme of people telling a ""story"" and fitting characters in to suit that ""story"", without considering who they really were. I like that the victim was complex and had her own stuff to work through. Weirdly she reminded me of a ""what could have been"" for Trey in ""The Searcher"" had she not dropped what happened to her brother. And maybe it's the cynical vindictive in me, but it was kind of nice that in the end, Aislinn got what she wanted.

Even when the main characters are people I don't really like, I've enjoyed following them on their personal journeys even as they work these murder cases. I'm glad I still have a few more books to go with the Murder Squad."
"Hum. I guess my review is proof that you can't win em' all, because I found this book, while very well written (almost flawlessly, in fact) had one serious flaw: the main character. She is absolutely despicable. Every word she says to her loyal-to-a-fault partner is vile and vindictive in the extreme (""Do you think I'm fucking brain damaged?"" is a typical retort). I was ready to put this book down every time I read one of their exchanges. Yeah, we get that she's 'tough' and has Daddy Issues, but spending 15 pages on descriptions of her effing and blinding and slagging her partner off because she can't handle the idea of a daughter wanting to find her dad, is frankly overkill.

Her vicious dialogue tone would make more sense if it wasn't completely at odds with her narrative tone, which is eminently chilled and introspective. The two things totally jar. I don't know how this slipped past the radar of French, her editors or any friends who might have had a read-through of this book before it went to press. But every single time this character opens her mouth, I'm on the verge of tossing this book to one side. It's just too much. The internal monologue makes up for it, but only just, and only because it's so fine.

Oh, and what's with the internalized misogyny right from the get-go? ""You play one too many games and you get a houseful of murder D's"" is our female detective's first verdict upon finding a woman with her skull bashed in. Would a woman who's spent her whole murder career on domestic violence really have such a juvenile, ""blame-the-victim"" view of the world? I don't think so.

I read a lot of books by Kathy Reichs, who actually works with the bodies of real-life crime victims, and take her view as typical of women in that field, e.g. wholly compassionate and reserving her rage for the attacker, alone. French would have done well to shadow some women who've seen this crap first-hand, before making her main character into mouthpiece for the abuser. Clearly, French hasn't known that many women who've been punched in the face by their loved ones... lucky her! She shouldn't use her ignorance as yet another stick to beat them with, though."
"Nella squadra omicidi di Dublino i detective Antoniette Conway e Stephen Moran, sono visti come feccia: la prima perché donna e Stephen perché è suo alleato. A loro affidano anche i casi più scadenti, come ad esempio quelli di violenza domestica.
Tutto cambia però quando la vittima in questione è Aislinn Murray, trovata morta accanto a un tavolo apparecchiato per una cena romantica. Tutte le prove portano al ragazzo della vittima, ma la detective Conway non è convinta e resiste alle pressioni di chi invece vorrebbe chiudere il caso. Quando iniziano a venire fuori verità nascoste il caso prende una piega inaspettata e Conway non è più sicura che la squadra omicidi sia così pulita come vogliono farle credere.

Antoniette Conway è un personaggio che può risultare pesante lungo il corso della narrazione, costantemente scorbutica e acida. Al contrario io l’ho apprezzata particolarmente (sarà perché mi rispecchio parecchio nel suo carattere). Mi è sembrato un personaggio sincero e vero senza troppe caricature.
Un’altra cosa che ho amato di questo personaggio è come reagisce con grinta davanti a qualsiasi situazione bella o brutta che sia. Possiamo definirla una donna con gli attributi.

Stephen Moran è il suo opposto. Per questo motivo rende equilibrata la coppia, anche se in questo libro il personaggio è poco approfondito.

Per quanto riguarda la narrazione del libro, inizialmente ero un po’ perplessa perché poco abituata a leggere gialli del genere.
È una vera e propria indagine con tanto di interrogatori descritti minuziosamente, punti morti, ricerca di prove ecc…
Nonostante l’inizio sia stato un po’ faticoso il libro mi è piaciuto.

L’ autrice mette in risalto anche i lati negativi di essere una donna che lavora nella squadra omicidi, facendolo con sarcasmo, caratteristica che ho amato.

La narrazione è in prima persona e vede come protagonista la detective Conway.
Il libro fa parte di una serie ambientata nella squadra omicidi di Dublino. Ogni storia ha un protagonista diverso.
Nel prossimo il protagonista è Stephen Moran."
"This is the sixth Murder Squad novel by Tana French and the one I least enjoyed. The novels are loosely connected by characters from the previous novel appearing in the subsequent one, and of course, as they all occur in the same office of the Dublin police department. These stories are character driven with the plotting secondary. And Ms French is superb at her characterization, and not just in the main characters. Her style is also superb. She writes just as deftly and convincingly from a male or female standpoint and with all the idiosyncrasies that make every character unique. And dialogue, great here too.The plots are usually not the same great depth as the characters, although many reviewers seemed to disagree with me. Perhaps I've read too many procedurals, seen to many Law and Orders and CSIs but the plots seem monodimensional compared with the multidimensional characters. Take the Tresspasser. We have a young woman found dead in her home, table set for a romantic dinner. We have her date at her house at the time of murder, verified by several sources. But it soon becomes clear that although he is being handed up on a plate, to a not-so-causal reader, he just couldn't be the one that did it. Now, it takes our crew of detectives to hash through a couple hundred pages to get to that conclusion, or, are they wrong?I must say that Antionette Conway, the lead protagonist, was just not that likeable. She is the lone woman in the squad harassed by the men, at least one of whom has deliberately lied about her past to make her a pariah in the squad. So she is hard nosed, tough and takes no bull. Actually, she is mostly just bitchy to everyone, even her own partner and just not very likeable. Compare her to Det. Rizolli from Tess Gerritson. Same situation but much more human and a character I like quite a bit. So for me, this book just did not hit the right buttons. But I will still look forward to and read Ms French's next novel."
"Meine Meinung

Die Geschichte fing richtig spannend an, man betrag mit bekannten Detectivs den Tatort und versuchte Stück für Stück den Fall zusammen zusetzen. Schnell wurde einem klar; hier ist nichts wirklich klar. Die Theorien änderten alle paar Minuten und die Protagonisten Antoinette Conway war mir leider von Anfang an nicht sympathisch.

Mit ihrer Art eckte sie aber nicht nur bei mir sondern auch bei ihren Kollegen an und so hatte man es mit einem etwas schwierigen Charakter zu tun. Und obwohl die Geschichte aus ihrer Sicht geschrieben / erzählt wurde baute man als Leser nur schwer eine Beziehung zu ihr auf.

Dagegen war mir Stephen Moran viel sympathischer, ihn lernte ich bereits in “Geheimer Ort” kennen und war richtig happy darüber noch einen Fall mit ihm gemeinsam zu lösen.

Leider wurde mir der Plot aber mit der Zeit zu kompliziert und irgendwie auch frustrierend. Die Theorien wechselten ständig und so kam es einem vor nicht wirklich in der Geschichte voran zu kommen. Und auch als man wusste wie das ganze nun abgelaufen war, war die Auflösung leider alles andere als befriedigend.

Für mich war die Geschichte zu sehr in die Länge gezogen und konnte die Spannung einfach nicht aufrecht erhalten.

Sprecher & Hörerlebnis

Die Sprecherin Nina Petri hat auf jeden Fall einen tollen Job gemacht. Ich konnte mich gut in die Geschichte hinein versetzen und obwohl mir die Protagonisten nicht sympathisch war, fand ich die Sprecherin richtig gut.

Fazit

Gefrorener Schreib konnte mich mit der Story leider nicht überzeugen, mir war die Geschichte zu sehr in die länge gezogen. Ausserdem gefiel mir die Auflösung nicht und war mir einfach zu unglaubwürdig.

"Detectives Antoniette Conway and Steve Moran already have the night shift due to their lack of family lives but lately it seems like all they get are the bar fights and domestic murders. Conway craves that call that gives them a serial killer or a high profile case but knows that since most of the detectives in the department hate her and Steve that their chances are slim for a case like that. As they wrap up the paperwork of a bar fight turned murder and are getting ready to go home after their shift, their Gaffer comes in and gives them a new case: a woman’s body has been called in and it has all the appearances of a domestic fight gone wrong. Exhausted but determined to prove their worth, Conway and Moran take the case on but something isn’t as it seems. The woman’s flat looks like it was straight out of a catalogue and she looks like a Barbie. Is the victim really as materialistic as she appears? Who killed her? Was it even a murder or was this a date gone wrong and manslaughter? Tensions are high as they investigate. Will the pieces come together? Will they finally earn the department’s respect?

Tana French has an incredible ability to give life to words on a page. Her novels are very atmospheric and tense with the character’s stress. This wasn’t a favorite novel of hers for me but I definitely enjoyed it. This one is without a doubt one of the darker novels of her Dublin Murder Squad series. This novel spends a lot of time focusing on the working relationships of the various detectives within the department, in the end this helps by providing a background story of the unit and develops the characters further but it is a little dull to read. I also felt like Conway was a bit whiny since a good portion of the novel revolves around her desire to prove herself to everyone. Overall it is was entertaining even if it was a little anti-climactic.
"
"(This is a rambling review that I have not edited- am just getting my thoughts and feelings out) Similarly to how other readers seemed to feel, I think this is a wonderful book with a fascinating storyline that falls short of the female character arc that I know French is capable of writing. But I think this feeling is on me rather than Tana. I think maybe my negative feelings towards Conways character development came from a sense of parallel between us- creating a narrative in your head that you fall so deeply into and immediately assume everyone is a part of. Conway is also a very impulsive character, which makes her such a strong character as well as helping build up the take-no-shit persona, and it’s clear that sometimes it takes time and new information for her to really process the reality of what happened earlier. French remains unable to disappoint in her stories, this one full of twists and turns that feel natural to the environment and not forced. You see the world through Conway’s eyes but it’s clear when something is her opinion vs fact. My favorite part of the book was on page 465. It reads “Me and Steve, we went at McCann by ripping away what he believed most about his life...hoping there’d be too little of him left to hold out against us. O’Kelly offered McCann a way back to who he was.” French is a flawlessly developer of character. Every opinion, every sentence comes with weight. At every step of the way you understand why everyone is acting the way they are even if their actions are wrong and they know it. Following McCann’s arc has left me deep in thought, and I’m sure I will be for awhile. I don’t know if I’ll reread this one.. but as a one-off and as a stepping stone from Moran and Conway’s relationship in Secret Place, it’s an important story in understanding French’s style and knowledge. "
"i don't normally read mysteries / potboilers other than the Comoran Strike series by Galbraith/Rowling, so i was cautiously optimistic about this one when it came up on the #BookSquadGoals podcast list. and there's a lot about THE TRESPASSER that i really enjoyed. the dialog is good. the pacing is good. and the characters feel real.

what kept me from really loving the book, however, was how long it went on. while the dialog is a strength of the novel, Tana French seems to realize this, so she leans into it. the detective work here is all done in a series of long interviews. most of the interviews were very interesting, but by the end of the book, i was hoping that there would be a plot development that occurred from another source. maybe by peeking around smokey alleys, or eavesdropping in a pub downtown, or rifling through some old trash. instead, all of the major plot points come up in conversations. it's good, but it gets repetitive, and it works into a rhythm where you feel: ""oh, this conversation has lasted more than two pages, i guess a twist is about to come up.""

i know that sounds really negative, but i enjoyed my time in the protagonist's head. Antoinette Conway is interesting, entertaining, and cool. while it's a first-person account, it never slips into the pure ""i'm telling you exactly how i'm feeling"" mode that many authors allow. instead, Conway isn't always honest with herself about how she feels, which allows French to show-not-tell in these events.

oh, and i hated the detour the book took when a character from Conway's past comes and goes within a single scene."
"Each novel in French’s “Dublin Murder Squad Series” is narrated by a different detective, someone who appears as a supporting character in an earlier book, a psychologically unstable sleuth with a distinct voice.
“The Trespasser” concerns the squad itself, the pinnacle of the force and the unit (along with Undercover) to which all Dublin police aspire.
French studied drama at Trinity College and worked in the theatre for ten years. Her detectives are all performers, and the Murder Squad detectives have have the lead roles. They pay close attention to how they dress, which cars they drive to the scene, and exactly how they walk once they get out of them. Their interrogations are elaborately staged to manipulate their witnesses and suspects.
Detective Conway is unusual among her murder squad colleagues in being both a woman and non-whit, emphasizing an outsider status already made likely by her loner personality and her explosive temper.
In this book, there is just one suspect from the very beginning with no evidence and only circumstantial witness testimony. This means that the detectives have to talk the solution out of the suspect. And talk and talk and talk.
Some reviewers find these interrogations brilliant. As I said earlier, French studied drama and I think she ADORES dialog. There is VERY little action.
SO, the puzzle can only be solved by close listening and clever questioning in extended inquisitorial encounters with all parties. As with other Tana French books, I found too much talking, though characters were interesting and setting very strong and relationships among characters very well developed.
"
"Things I've learned about Tana French novels (having read a few in the last few months)
1. They start slow. I just don't get into them right away, it takes some time. By the end, though, I know I'll be sitting in my reading chair until that thing is DONE and no one better try to criticize.
2. They aren't short, and neither are the chapters. This seems like a minor issues but there you go. When you finish one chapter and the next is under 10 minutes predicted reading time, you (well, I) usually just keep reading. When it's 20-40...you put the book down. (unless it's near the end, and then you read 3 of them in a row, see point 1.)
3. She writes a story that you want to know the ending of. (See reviews on ""in the woods"", with many complaints about questions left unanswered - you don't get so mad about this if you aren't drawn in.)
4. Lots of opportunities to predict what you think will happen, so good mystery style that way.

Now, wrt this book in particular. Not my favorite. It still met the above elements, mind you, but the protagonist, Antoinette, was too much. Oh, they've all had baggage, but Antoinette...the 'everyone hates me' was too much. And a part of me could see the grounds for it, but it was still annoying. Was it a way to make an unreliable narrator? If she won't trust anyone, how can we? Maybe. But, it was just too much for me. Still great story, but I really wanted to shake her a few times.

Still like it. Just not as much as earlier works. 3.5 stars, I'd say.
"
"Working at a library has convinced me that I need to read more genre fiction, not only because I find it important to try new things but also because ""Sorry, I can't recommend any good mysteries because I only read 'literature' "" sounds really awful in person. Plus, it's fun.

There is a lot to like about this book. I think French does a decent job of rounding out her characters and ensuring that, for the most part, they cannot be easily labeled as heroes or villains. I like the way she writes female characters for the same reason: those that are gritty and hardscrabble are gritty and hardscrabble in a believable, nuanced way, not just in a one-dimensional girl boss cop show way.

That being said, I agree with the reviewers who mention the fact that at times, Detective Conway's negativity is hard to endure for long stretches of time (and yes, this book does drone on unnecessarily, with long sequences of dialogue that could easily be removed). On the one hand, I think Conway's blunt cynicism provides a compelling framework for her emotional development and her relationship with others (see: her job-related paranoia, her relationship with her father, etc.) but on the other hand, her anger, bitterness, and judgmental nature were often exhausting enough to tear me out of the world of the narrative, making *me* feel frustrated in turn.

I think I would pick up another of French's books, though, and I wonder if a perspective from one of her other protagonists might smooth out some of the problems I had with this one.

"Way too long, each chapter could’ve been half the length. Was semi-interesting since takes place in Ireland with a female protagonist who’s a lead homicide detective, but left a lot to be desired. The murder mystery was easy to solve for me and there wasn’t really a major twist at the end or anything. Seemed very clear they were alluding to a dirty cop had committed the murder of Aislinn, and sure enough it was a fellow detective who did it, McCann, as he didn’t realize he was being played a fool by Aislinn who decided him to get back at him for not telling her and her mom decades ago when he was a Missing Persons detective that her father left their family, as he thought it was “better for them” not to know the truth that he simply left them for another woman. The main character, Antoinette, herself had a dad who left her and her mom as a child and you would’ve thought that would somehow tie into the murder but it really didn’t at all. The themes were: being a loner/discriminated against and traded as Antoinette never fit in on the Murder/Homicide team and was terrorized by her own teammates on the squad, but she cracks the case against a cop in her own department. I guess another theme was fathers leaving their families…not sure the lesson there - McCann nearly leaves his own family for Aislinn, part of her master plan to get revenge on him for seemingly aiding in destroying her family by not letting her mom know where their missing dad went. It didn’t have any wow moments or great lessons for me. Had potential and fell flat, and again way way too long."
"I'm a French loyalist and I've loved every single one of her novels until this one. While I'd still call it a decent read, it was unlike anything else in French's series.

This last installment felt dispassionate and simple. Her characterization of Conway was relatively shallow, stereotypical, and disconnected. The plot itself felt formulaic and the pacing was tedious and boring for such a simple script. This book was so unlike the experimental narratives that French has given before, it felt unoriginal at best, almost like French was tired of the story herself.

Reading it, I saw plenty of opportunities that could have enhanced the flow of the narrative and made it more thrilling or lively. French didn't use any compelling techniques for this book and even the predictable climax felt very flat. It was sad to see these missed opportunities.

Unfortunately, the lack of interest even extended beyond the characters and storyline to the style of prose itself. I've always doted on French for being an excellent and beautiful writer, but with The Trespasser her voice felt lost and distant. The prose was adequate and made the reading enjoyable, but it felt like a far reach from her usual talents.

It's clear to say this was my least favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series. However, I'm glad to have read it. Hopeful the series will continue with a reinvigorated perspective next time."
"Bem, não sei por onde começar. Comprei o livro por causa das criticas (The New York Times, The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post) que dizem que a Tana French é ""uma das melhores"". Infelizmente, este livro, o 6 da coleção mas o meu 1, ficou aquém das expetativas que depositei depois de tantos elogios.

O livro não é mau, mas a história não me prendeu. Encontrei me pouco interessada no caso investigado. O fio condutor deste livro, Quem matou a personagem principal e porquê, rapidamente se tornou maçante. As teorias apresentadas a dada altura era tantas e tão fantasiosas, isto na ausência de provas, que se tornaram ridículas. Achei as personagens masculinas fracas e essencialmente más, e atendendo que deveriam ser os bons da fita, deveriam pelo menos ser complexas o suficiente para passar a ideia da que o mundo é cinzento e que as pessoas enquadradas em categorias ""boas"" e ""más"" são mais do que isso.

Pontos positivos: as personagens femininas. Bastantes diversas, e determinadas. Todas multidimensionais. O tom irónico e os discursos afiados. O Machismo desnudado, a personagem principal é mulher, e a abordagem ao Bullying institucional.

Não me parece que vá ler os restantes a autora. Mas passo a mensagem que é algo pessoal. Histórias de detetives e investigação de crimes focadas mais nas personagens que investigam e não nas vitimas e nos agressores não é o meu estilo literário. Quem gosta, vai gostar deste"
"Murder of a young woman

I have read all of Tans French's books. This was not one of my favorites. I just couldn't find anything sympathetic about the murder victim. Her character was woefully undeveloped. Sure we knew about her childhood. But nothing about her life drew me in. It wasn't until her pal Lucy came clean with the detective, which was at the end of the book, did I know the gist of what Windows was about. This was disappointing. Usually MS. French has her plot and characters so well defined and delineated. The rest of the story was alright. Detective Conway was not a very sympathetic character as I found her to vassilate between all consuming self-loathing disguised as self-awareness and a pitiful self fulfilling prophecy of ""everyone is out to get me"" Her partner Steve Moran was not at all developed. Normally I can relate and absorb MS. France's characters. Their personalities give me pause. Make me quest option what I would do in their circumstance. Not once in this book did either of the two protagonist give me pause. Overall it was a good story. It just that I was expecting much more because of having read her previous works. This was flat. No bubbles. The effervescent writing hit a miss this time. I will continue with this author because know how talented MS. French is. Her books have never disappointed in her previous efforts.Given her body of work, that is a meaningful track record."
"I feel like a lot of the praise for this book was for a familiar author and setting. Not having read any of French's books before, and never having been introduced to the Dublin Murder Squad before as a result, I didn't walk in with any loyalty.

I also am not a regular reader of murder mystery or cop drama or whatever you call it. I'm not sure if this book is a good example of the genre or not, but if it is, I can see why I don't get into it more. In a 400+ page book, I spent 300 pages trying to figure out what was going on and whether I was even interested enough to keep reading. It wasn't until I read some reviews of the book which got me started wondering if I had the angle all wrong on the book that I started getting interested, waiting for a twist no one would see coming.

I didn't find that there was a twist at all. As Dwight once said, ""it's the person you most medium suspect."" And I was right.

I also did not like Antoinette at all. She didn't seem to be a believable character, and her personal drama was just way too much for me.

I'm giving the book 3 stars because the story was well written and believable, and I was immersed while I was reading, for the most part. But a book that takes me a month to read probably doesn't have enough draw to recommend it any more highly."
"A Slow, Simmering Intelligent Thriller

Antoinette is the lead detective in the mysterious murder of a young woman, one who she swears she has met before. There is a somewhat promising suspect and one of her colleagues seems hell bent on her charging him and closing the case but Antoinette will not be cowed by anyone she does not trust and she trusts no one. Tough and unrelenting, Antoinette is a scrappy personality who has learned to rely only on herself. This case however as her stumped. It nags at Antoinette in disturbing ways and by the time she has it figured out, she is in way over her head.

It took a while to get past the unfamiliar rather heavy-handed cultural lingo and move into the meat of the story, not unexpected or unusual from an Irish writer, but reading as an American, I needed time to find my footing with the language which further slowed the pace.

French has written a sophisticated psychological thriller but the problem for me was it never moved past simmer. It was slow moving from start to finish. I was endlessly frustrated with the pace and the feeling that the story was moving around in circles. I would have loved to see about 100 pages trimmed and a quicker path to the ending. The ending itself was appropriate and mature but lacked the kind of fanfare that some may be looking for.

BRB Rating: Read It but only if you don’t mind a slower pace."
"I love her other books. This one, not as much. Our Murder Squad heroine is Antoinette Conway - her partner, newbie Steve Moran. Antoinnette has an attitude of persecution. She believes everyone else on the squad hates her and are pranking her, making comments and doing what they can to get her to leave. It turns out she has only one person who dislikes her, and all the things happening are from him. This drags on throughout the book, even when she is told several times that it really isn't happening that way. This was annoying to me and really spoiled the story.

Her case is a young woman killed in her home by a blow against the fireplace edge. Looks like she was hit and fell against it just wrong. She was expecting someone for dinner and the first look seems to point to the current new boyfriend. Especially when an experienced Detective tells her so. But she and Steve don't like being told what to do so they keep following leads which point to an ex-boyfriend who didn't know he was ex. Further, he appears to be the most unexpected person-another ""D"". What will happen once they are convinced he is the one. A trip to the gaffers office takes an unexpected turn and then another.

The police work and case is interesting and kept me guessing to the end-where she finally can see the truth of how the others see her."
"3.5, really. I'm glad I gave Tana French another chance. This was a MUCH better mystery-- a much sounder plot-- than In the Woods. Though Tana French once again displayed her talent for writing truly the world's most annoying protagonists. I almost gave up halfway through because I was DONE with my angry girl detective simultaneously hurting when the other D's hazed her and making asides to us, the readers, that she felt nothing. That her mom, friends, partner, etc. could walk out on her tomorrow and she wouldn't blink. Please. Pick one of those poles and stick with it.

Two threads I liked about this one. 1. the complexity of the murder squad: its inner loyalties, its sexism, its hierarchies, its competing ambitions. Some detectives had a penchant for gaslighting, some older grizzled ones had insights the new ones couldn't see. Some you didn't trust. Their relationships are tenuous but could work wonders when they were united against a suspect, and I found myself believing it all.

2. That they weren't looking ""out there"" for the murderer. They weren't swinging wildly from exotic sccne to daring car chase to gripping interview room confrontation. It was subtle. There are machinations going on in the department that I wanted to know about, that were itching the imagination. So I kept reading. And I was rewarded. Even though the conclusion took forever. She set me up good: I would get to one false conclusion and think, ""Yep, that guy did it. Satisfying ending! But wait, there's still 85 pages left... What else could happen??"""
"I wanted to love this book. French is a good writer, but the story telling is lacking. Far too slow to start, I was unsure I would make it through to the end. Too much whining by Antoinette--without knowing her, this was very annoying. I've not read book two, three, and four of the series, so perhaps there was goodwill built up in previous stories. So for me, I found her difficult to care about and/or root for her to win. Many of the characters seemed stock--the smarmy newspaper reporter, the wise old department head who may or may not be bad, the entire squad as suspect, the young partner we learn to love, but then are made to question his loyalty, the wimpy pathetic boyfriend, the angry uncooperative BFF, etc.

This could have been a really tight, tense chase/thriller. Instead it was weighted down with stories of missing fathers, why men cheat, and workplace harassment. The tension was never strong enough--it never took over and made me ""need to continue"". A good edit--slash maybe 70 pages, tighten up the side stories, and make our protagonist seem like there are skills underneath the doubts--this could have been so good. Instead, it was ok.

--I'd love to see this series made into a movie. If all the stories happening close together--the entire department working on multiple cases--it would have enough meat to be fantastic.

"
"I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would. The first few pages set it up as a police procedural, and yes, there was some of that, but as the inconsistencies kept coming, I kept reading.

A woman is found with her skull open at the bottom of the stairs, alone in her locked home. But she did not die all on her own. There's meat in the oven, but the oven is turned off. The table is set for two, but only one wine glass has been touched, clearly while cooking. Her date swears he went over at the appointed time, but she did not answer the door. Did he kill her and then set up his alibi, or is he telling the truth about ringing the doorbell just minutes after she is thought to have died, then walking away disappointed?

A senior cop assigned to help out on the case is convinced that the date did it. The other two less experienced officers are far from agreeing with him. The pressure builds to just close the case, and the more it builds, the more suspicious they are that there must be more to the story. Now they have to investigate in secret or risk their jobs and their lives.

Well written, though sometimes repetitive in that the one old cop keeps coming back saying the same thing, and going around in circles. It was important to the story, but was maybe a little too heavy for reading. It was indeed a longer-than-average book."
"Tana French writes excellent mysteries. She develops strong characters and puts them into taut settings and situations. In this book we follow Antoinette Conway, a formidable woman of color serving on the Dublin police force. She is a high-energy, twitchy woman with a hot temper. She is nobody's fool, and does not give an inch to the bullying and belittling behavior she receives from her fellow officers. She doesn't take any ""shite"" from anyone.

The murder victim Aislann Murray, a beautiful blonde whose troubled past parallels some of Conway's own family history. However, unless Conway becomes more of a ""franchise"" character, I'm not sure the family history is meaningful enough to warrant the ink used to describe it.

This was an interesting addition to French's collection, but not one of my favorites. I found the first half plodding, with some red herrings that were explored a little too deeply. The 464 pages could have used some editing.

The title is puzzling. Who, exactly, is the trespasser? I sensed it was Antoinette, herself, who is treated as an interloper within her own department. I thought this was more apt an interpretation than pinning the title on the murderer (although a case could be made for that, as well)."
"Having read several of Tana French's novels I was really looking forward to this Irish detective thriller, especially since it has received so many good reviews. But I finished it slightly disappointed, feeling certain that the length could and should have been cut by about a third.

It started well, in a no-nonsense fashion, and the mail characters were well-drawn, though the ""heroine"" hardly endeared herself to the reader. But I accepted her flaws, just as I'm sure Tana French intended. However, her sidekick ultimately irritated me with his ""what if?"" scenarios which started as quite thought-provoking but eventually became tiresome.

Most of the murder suspect interrogation scenes were vivid and atmospheric and these proved to be the best sections of the novel. However the narrative pace slackened, became too wordy and I found myself quite relieved that the murderer was finally pinned down (not literally, though it would have been preferable!).

In my view, Faithful Place is Tana French's best novel to date, though I am aware that not all share this opinion. Nevertheless, she has a gift for writing pithy sentences which are often memorable and can have the power to draw the reader right back into the heart of the story.



"
"Maybe like 3.5 stars?I read this like 2 months ago, so this isn't comprehensive, but TW for gore, violence, discussion of sexual assault, and a decent amount of smokingI don't know if I'll ever like a Dublin Murder Squad book as much as In The Woods (was just looking, past me rated it 4 stars, but it's stuck with me and might be higher? should reread). The Trespasser brings some things back for me - Antoinette Conway (main character here) is a gritty detective with a massive chip on her shoulder, some of it warranted. She's not likable, but she is interesting. I don't think a lot of folks care for her partner, Stephen Moran, but I like his head-in-the-clouds, aspirational quality, especially as partnered with detectives like Conway. I look for strong feminism in works, and I go back and forth on how that's represented here. I think some folks would find strength in the diverse women represented in this work; I think others would find a bleak, accurate depiction of true-to-life misogyny that is not exactly enriching. YMMVHere's what keeps me coming back to Tana French. She gives me the puzzle pieces I need to follow the mystery on my own, but she still finds ways to surprise me that don't feel all deus ex machina."
"Detective Antoinette Conway is ready to move on from the Dublin Murder Squad. Apart from her partner, Stephen Moran, the other detectives seem to go out of their way to make her job hard, with some even going as far as harassment. When a case comes in at the end of her shift, she initially thinks it's just another domestic. What she doesn't realize is that this case will change the course of her life and the future of the murder squad.

I was ready to pan this one, a shock since I've mostly enjoyed French's work. I was not a fan of the main character, an angry and bitter woman that believes everyone is out to get her. Even the case itself was not really interesting. But what do you know, in the last 40 pages or so French brings the punches after she's slowly danced around to build a slow tension, and the punches land. Not as hard as in some of her other works (whew, Faithful Place), but they come with impact and leave you wondering, with Antoinette, what's really been happening the whole time. To be sure there are answers, and they're not unsatisfying, but it all seems too little too late. Overall this is still a solid part of the Murder Squad series, though not the strongest, and I'm looking forward to what French has for us next."
"The Trespasser by Tana French was fun to read over the long weekend. I'm used to watching Law & Order and seeing a straightforward plot that wraps up neatly under an hour. This novel is 449 pages. I'm not used to investing this much time in a crime story, but it's worth it if you have the patience to read about tedious parts of policework like surveillance and reviewing data. Evidence-gathering is not as exciting as I imagined but I'm fascinated by workplace procedures and operations. Antoinette Conway, a murder detective in Ireland, investigates the murder of a young and beautiful woman. The victim died in her townhouse and her date, a sweet and struggling bookstore owner, is the suspect. Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, chase down leads and eliminate dead ends. Conway has to put up with harassment from colleagues and a pesky journalist. Her partner has her back, though. They have doubts about the main suspect and getting closer to the truth puts their lives and careers in jeopardy. I love female detective stories on TV, but I think this is the first one I've read. Olivia Benson and Mare Sheehan are my favorite TV heroines. I don't count Nancy Drew since she's an amateur sleuth. I didn't realize this was part of a series. It's fine as a standalone. "
"3.5. This police procedural is almost more about the lead detective than it is about the murder case.

Antoinette Conway and Steve Morran are newbies in TH murder squad, work the night shift and usually end up with easily solved domestic disputes. But out of the blue, their boss hands them a case that could be a big one....one caveat: they must work with Breslin, a seasoned detective who is quite full of himself.

Antoinette has a massive chip on her shoulder, is abrasive and angry. Her partner Steve is amiable and likable. But somehow they work very well together. Bit by bit we learn what has made her so angry and sure that everyone on the squad is out to get her, including Breslin. She can't stomach Breslin.....

Oh, yes, and the murder? A young pretty woman named Aislinn has been murdered in her home. It looks like her new boyfriend did it. Breslin pushes for a quick solve, but there are elements about the case that don't sit well, particularly with Steve....and just why was Breslin put on the case to begin with, and why the big rush?

Sometimes the procedural parts get a bit tedious, and I have to say, this one started off pretty slowly....but it proved more than worth the initial slog."
"It was just another Saturday night in Dublin for Aislinn Murray. She’s preparing a meal for a guy who could become her new boyfriend. That’s when someone walks into her house through the back door and murders her.

Antoinette Conway is sure everyone in the workplace is out to get her. She has good reason to think that. She’s a female member of Dublin’s Murder Squad, and not all the good old boys think she should be there. Someone took a long luxuriant leak in her locker and soiled her running gear and destroyed files. Someone else coughed up a wad of phlegm in her coffee. Those people are in the minority, but she sees even the slightest slight as a personal massacre, and that’s impacting the decisions she makes and the feelings she has toward others in the workplace.

Conway and her partner, Stephen Moran, draw a murder case while they are literally on their way out the door at the end of a shift. They get far more than they bargained for.

I confess I struggled with this book. The last quarter of it was magnificent—tense, suspenseful, unstoppable. By that, I mean I couldn’t stop reading. Prior to that, this was a periodic slog. I predicted the broad-brush end result of this. But I enjoyed the route the author took to get there
"
"While I love a murder mystery book, this one aggravated and even stressed me out at times! I picked this up at my local Savers and didn't realize that it was part of a series. Thankfully, this book worked pretty well as a standalone and I was able to read it without wondering about previous plots from the other books.

The main thing about this book that stressed me out, was Antoinette's treatment by the rest of the squad, as well as her increasing paranoia over who was on her side and who was against her. That, coupled with multiple possible muderers in this case, some linking quite closely to the very men that were giving her a hard time on the squad, made this an anxious read for me.

As her paranoia grew, Antoinette grew more and more bitter and angry, often lashing out at the other characters. This was sometimes justified and understandable, especially with her treatment from the rest of the squad, but still kept me from fully loving the character. And if she wasn't lashing out at someone or second guessing every, single, person around her, the characters were interrogating someone, which happened quite a lot.

All in all, I did really enjoy this book, but in the middle it did get to be a little bit of a mess that had to be waded through."
"Some elusive quality that had infused the prior stories was missing here—Antoinette, I hardly knew ye. Despite being in her head and processing her thoughts for some 400 pages, I still didn't know who she really was behind the no-nonsense exterior and brittle interior. The plot is formulaic here to an extent; the lone female cop versus the old boys' club, toss in some paranoia, deceit, betrayals; mix. But the things that matter here are deeper: the psychological uncertainty, the nuances in the interactions between Conway and Moran and Breslin and the people they come across. The parallels between father figures and Conway versus Aislynn are nicely done, but what bothered me most was probably the deux ex machina, uncalled for, that was Conway's father randomly showing up in the thick of things and then exiting stage right with no fanfare, but conveniently igniting the spark in Conway's thinking that eventually led her down the right path. My main issue is that I felt like I never really knew who Conway was as a character—her backstory, her context, her life outside being a Murder D—nor for that matter Moran (albeit this may be because we were not in his head this time around)."
"Six books into her novels about Dublin's Murder Squad, Tana French continues to write consistently entertaining mysteries with engaging characters and well-drawn settings. As with the earlier books, The Trespasser takes characters from a previous novel and moves them to the center. In this case, it's Conway and Moran from The Secret Place, with Antoinette Conway taking over the role of narrator. French expertly manipulates our understanding of Conway along the way. There were times when I was really frustrated with her (Conway, that is).

I was a little disappointed by the case itself, although while I've put down some mysteries with the sense that they constitute little more than a standard hour-long police procedural show, at least here it feels substantial enough for a full-length movie or perhaps even better a miniseries. While I see that I've rated each of the other books 3 stars as well, I would rank this one as number 3 or 4. French plays to her strengths here -- in addition to the characters, she immerses us in her setting so well that I swear I started thinking with an Irish accent for a while."
"If  The Trespasser  had been written by anyone else, I'd probably have given it four stars, but my expectations tend to get a little atmospheric when I start a Tana French novel. The first-person narrative turned me off a little bit at the very beginning and contributed to my slow start. As I made way way deeper into the pages, it began to make sense, though. This story couldn't be told from any point of view but Antoinette Conway, the sole female detective on the Dublin Murder Squad because it's Conway's view of her squad relationships that make the story engaging.At its core,  The Trespasser is a story about stories: The stories we spin for ourselves about how the world works. The stories we choose to believe because we so badly want them to be true. The stories we tell others to manipulate, deceive, and hurt. The stories we hide from others and ourselves. The stories we make up because they are better than our real-life story. Tana French deftly weaves together so many versions of the the truth according to her characters, that no one has a clear picture of the real world until the very end, even the reader."
"I mistakingly began this book without realizing it was in a series. I don't think I missed out on much because of it, but I could be wrong. It was an enjoyable read, I never felt like it was trouble to get through. I appreciate that the cliche routes were often not taken and, when they were, it made sense. It's refreshing, in a lot of ways, that the author doesn't take her main character too seriously in ways other authors might fail to avoid. But, I found many of the characters to have very similar characteristics and traits. It felt like every character was good at reading people, lying, manipulating, but doing what they thought was best. It's nice that there's a lot of play with morality, but it contributes to the instances where the characters start to feel like the author playing chess with herself. There's often similar ways of speaking common across characters. ""Do you get that?"" was a question asked multiple times by multiple people throughout. And everybody either acts stoic, or actually is stoic under a facade.

Overall I enjoyed the book. My issues were mostly small nitpicks that didn't negatively impact the read too much. I may check out more from the author."
"The Trespasser, Tana French
French is a superb crime fiction writer. This, her newest, is a complex look at the inner workings of a murder investigation, from the view point of a young female detective and her newbie partner.
Detective Antoinette Conway is feeling very paranoid and uneasy with her place in the Murder Squad. Her dream job seems to be slipping away and the entire squad seems out to get her.
She and her partner work well together, he's new to, but she's such a mess because of all the hazing, she doesn't know who to trust. When they pick up a case that seems to be your average domestic homicide, they are both unprepared for what follows. Yet both are good at their job and, even if it means they have to question one of their own, they give the investigation all they've got.
This is a deep dive into police interrogation and meticulous police work, but it is also a look at how hard it is for a talented and hard working woman to fit in to a man's world. Not my favorite of hers but a good read about human nature and the art of police investigation."
"Hmm I wasn't completely engaged with this novel. It really didn't get going for me until well over half way. One of the issues was that I didn't particularly like Detective Antoinette Conway. Clearly there was some history with some colleagues at the Murder squad and, as a result, she carried a massive chip on her shoulder for the entire novel. Her work relationship with her only ally and colleague, Detective Steve Moran, saved it for me. They worked together well and he understood her....more so than this reader! As the story progressed some of that aforementioned history was revealed which helped explain her disdain for her colleagues, but she still remained a very abrasive character. As the twists and turns started to pile up from the halfway point the novel FINALLY picked up the pace and had me turning the pages well into the night. The strong finish saved this from a 2 star read. This is my second Tana French novel, the other being Broken Harbour, and both have been solid but not spectacular. Probably not an author I'll seek out in future."
"This was my first Tana French novel, a current one that happened to have gotten good reviews all around. Not paying much attention, I downloaded it from the library as an audiobook, realising about halfway though (when I needed to renew it) that it was 20 hours long. Fortunately, most of it was decent listening. Excellent reader, great writing, generally compelling story.

Set in Dublin, a hard-ass female lead detective and her male partner get assigned to solve the murder of a beautiful blonde woman found dead via violent means on her living room floor. Several of their colleagues would like them to wrap up the case based on a cursory investigation, but the pair of ""Ds"" are having none of it. They follow conspiracy theories left and right, until they get a confession and do a lot of personal reflection along the way.

This book is not exactly a page-turner (if you can say that about an audiobook anyway), but it revealed fascinating insights into police interrogation techniques, the dialogue was letter perfect, and the plot hung together quite credibly.

"
"And (woe) I'm through with the series. While I don't think Tana French could write a bad book (or a bad mystery) if she tried, this was the least even of the series for me—I never fully got in Conway's head, I think, and I stagnated for a while in the middle while she and Moran went chasing red herrings. (I like good red herrings in mysteries, mind, so it's not those that made things slow...more just that I wasn't as interested in the characterisation here.)

It picked up eventually, though, and one thing I've really loved about this series—and that held true here—is that the outcome is never obvious. Having a different narrator for each book means that anything is possible: the hero/ine could succeed wildly, they could quit their jobs at the end, they could die. Some outcomes are more likely than others, of course, but I love how much space there is for tension in that possibility. I would love to see this series continued, but in the meantime...at least there's still The Witch Elm to read."
"Going into this book I kind of already had a feeling that it was not going to be the best. The person who gets murdered is the prettiest blondest most stereotypical image of a ""perfect woman"" (from the male gaze). It was supposed to be a pretty straightforward ""the boyfriend did it"" kind of case, but then there are bits and bobs that do not add up. The assigned detective is the only woman on the squad who feels alienated and she decides to continue pursuing the case even when a more senior detective tells her to just wrap it up (isn't that suspicious). First they pursue a gang-related angle which is ludicrous, because WTF? Maybe this was supposed to be ludicrous to show how susceptible the detectives are to CrAzY ideas? Anyways, finally they catch on to maybe the secret 2nd boyfriend being a cop, and blah blah so it goes. They sort it out and question him and it looks like maybe he will get away with it! But then he doesn't and the end. That whole last part was kinda rushed. Overall not bad, but not as good as other Tana French books I have read. "
"yeesh this woman can write an interrogation scene.

Overall I can understand that Tana French isn't the author for everyone. Her murder mysterious are slow burns, with lots of Irish-detective musings and introspections, heavy on the atmosphere of it all. There is not a lot of action - each book is a highly fleshed out series of character studies that will grip you - or not (you can see this in the reviews; no one really has the same favourite books). Sometimes you're left going ""wait was there some freaky supernatural folklore stuff going on there?"" and not all questions are answered. But man these are some of the best mysteries I've read in a while - I am a FAN.

Final series ranking:
1) The Likeness - 5 stars. Dark academia goodness.
2) The Secret Place - 4.5 stars. Boarding school kids are wacko. Love it.
3) Broken Harbour - 4 stars. Suburbia hell that actually gave me the creeps.
4) In the Woods/ The Trespasser - 3 stars. I needed more from both; both left me unsatisfied with their endings.
5) Faithful Place - 2 stars. Criminally boring."
"Caveat: I've only read In the Woods so I'm missing context for Conway's character, it seems. But anyway, she would be much more interesting if in her interior narration she ever experienced emotions besides anger and slight embarrassment for not being right all the time. There's a good amount of pages devoted to Conway explaining how stupid other people are. It makes the ending, when she reflects on her time with the squad, all the more annoying for its inconsistency with her character and the fact that 
even if only Roche fucked with her, others' silence makes the environment just as unnecessarily toxic. The other thing there's a lot of is characters recognizing others' slight facial tics in response to information. I don't think anyone's that expressive or able to read expressions, but whatever. The plot itself is interesting enough, but the things I mentioned made it hard to enjoy."
"This is the only Tana French book I've read and I don't think I liked enough to read more. The story started out interesting enough but it didn't take long before I didn't like any of the characters, except maybe Moran who was never really fully developed. To begin with, Antoinette, the main character doesn't really like anyone and since the story is told from her perspective, all of her squad-mates get a bad rap from the very beginning. She also doesn't like the victim, the accused, or really anyone else. In fact, all she really does is whine about how awful everyone else is. What a persecution complex!

The writing could have benefited from some tighter editing. The endless conversations that result in nothing are tedious and don't do much to move the story forward. Half of the events in the book have no impact on the outcome of the main story. Why are they even there?

I seem to be in the minority, but this style of book just doesn't hold my attention."
"I like this series, and I like the switch to a different narrator every time. These books hold my attention and they're good for an afternoon or two of escapism. I appreciated that in this installment, French gave us a narrator who (for once) doesn't seem to have any skeletons in her closet. A chip on her shoulder, sure, but she's honest.

I do get tired of the highly dysfunctional Murder Squad, though - can't they find any normal people to play detective in Dublin? I feel like half these people should never have passed their background investigations. Or their psych evals. The red herrings get a little over-used, too. Six books in, I pretty much know who didn't dunnit as soon as they're introduced, and this one has a crazily complicated plot as usual. The real surprise with the next book, if such a thing happens, will be if French can keep the twists down to just eight or nine."
"I had been so looking forward to reading this newest entry in this series - I absolutely love Tana French. But sadly I was a little disappointed in this one. There were seemingly endless interrogation scenes or scenes of detectives talking about interrogating a suspect. I think I even fell asleep during one... And I tried to like the main character but her insecurity just drove me insane and when she crapped all over her partner, I just lost it and there was no way to redeem her in my eyes. Which was a shame as the early scenes with them working together and seeming to ""get"" each other so well were wonderful. I think he was a saint to forgive her - I couldn't. Also the wrap-up was a little expected - no twists or interesting conclusion. Just kind of sad. As someone here said, Tana French's books are heads above everyone else so even if it's not her best (in my opinion), it's still pretty darn good!
"
"3.5 stars
I was in a bit of a reading slump. I find the best cure to be a thriller or a mystery to get me back in the groove. I have seen this cover around, so when it was available at the library, I downloaded it.

This book is told by Dublin Detective Antoinette Conway as her and her partner solve the murder of a 26 year old woman. What seems like an open-and-shut case, of course, isn't. The case and Conway's life is further compliacted by being the only woman and POC on the Dublin murder squad.

I thought this would be a nail biter, but it was a slow, slow burn of 451 pages. I considered not finishing it a few times, but I always have to know whodunit. It was unnecessarily long. The story was good, but I prefer a heartracing, fast-paced thriller. I will say the characters were well-developed, although the protagonist wasn't the most likeable as she drowned in self pity. I will give Tana French another try since I know she is well liked, but this book just didn't do it for me."
"3,5 Sterne

Und wieder arbeitet das Detective-Duo Antoinette Conway und Stephen Moran zusammen. Eine junge Frau wird in ihrem Haus ermordet aufgefunden, der Tisch ist für ein romantisches Abendessen gedeckt. Und die vermeintliche Unterstützung eines erfahrenen Kollegen aus der Mordkommission fühlt sich immer mehr wie eine Behinderung an. Stephen und Antoinette stoßen auf immer mehr Ungereimtheiten, und da hilft es auch nicht, dass Antoinette's toughe Art nicht bei allen Kollegen im Team gut ankommt...

Erneut ein solider Fall, wie gewohnt detailreich und mit hohem Dialoganteil. Und doch konnte er mich nicht vollständig überzeugen. Leider haben sich doch ein paar Längen eingeschlichen. Und mit Antoinette's Art kam ich zum Teil überhaupt nicht klar. Nichts gegen eine starke Frau, die sich in der Männerwelt behauptet, aber ihre Art und Weise ging auch mir leider manchmal auf die Nerven.

Nina Petri liest das ganze eher unaufgeregt..."
"This dragged on and on in a tedious, play-by-play sort of manner. Long slow, drawn-out descriptions of peoples' facial expressions, mouths, breathing during interviews, in conversations with other cops...and on and on.

Extreme overuse of ""f*ck"" and ""up the hole"" and ""Jaysus!"" We get it, the murder squad is a tough bunch, but also a very boring, unimaginative bunch.

The main character Antoinette is so bitter and volatile, so anti-social, carrying the chip on her shoulder like a trophy. It got old fast.

You find out who the murderer is way before the end but still have to read through all the repetitive interviews. And I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for the person in authority who knew who it was all along and kept quiet, and will go down with the ship, but I didn't care.

So basically, the plot was boring and the characters were no one I wanted to root for. I just couldn't wait for it to be over."
"Tana French is an excellent writer. There's always a point at which her plots - the details of the mystery - don't ring true for me. They're too clever by half; so clearly the product of plotting, instead of how actual people would actually think or act. I don't buy them. I think if she weren't writing detective fiction - with its convention of following clues, outlining them, and then explaining the mystery - that her stories might hold together better. The granular detail, which needs to be twisty and surprising, just ends up feeling a bit baroque to me. Except, I'm not sure she actually is writing detective fiction, or cares whether her plots are plausible or true to life. Instead, I get the feeling she picks an idea, and rotates it 360 degrees, playing it out in every thread and every variation over the course of a book. I found that effort a bit belaboured in this one - which made the reading feel a bit of slog. Still. "
"I'm a huge Tana French fan, which is a double-edged sword: it means I also may have had too-high expectations for this new release, so read this with a grain of salt. But this one felt like it was rushed to press. As a writer, I may read too closely, but this felt like it was not given the rich texture and nuance I expect from her books. The procedurals and the plot are all there, and the lead D has a distinctive voice, but it was without that magic that usually sucks me in to her writing. It was the sort of thing like, the lead D would say a suspect would be interviewed, but would sit in the same location while someone else went out to do it. It left the effect of a writer telling, not carrying you into the action. That's as critical as I'll ever get with her. She's still my favorite writer at the moment, and I'll push just as hard to want another new release as quick as it's out. "
"Antoinette Conway is the only member of the Dublin Murder squad, the homicide investigation unit of the Police department. She's assertive and forceful, which doesn't endear her to her squadmates. When she's handed a relatively easy open and shut case regarding a young woman's killing, the squad encourages her to make the easy arrest for the girl's new boyfriend. But as her investigation continues, she finds all is not as it seems.

This is a great novel about police procedure full of suspense and mystery. The best parts of the book are the interrogations, where you can almost feel the tension between the police and suspects. I listened to the audio version, which was voiced by an Irish cast, and lent to the realism of the novel.

I'll definitely be on the lookout for another Murder squad novel with Antoinette Conway."
"A reluctant three stars. I love the way Tana French's language sounds in my head, even if the story is weak. Or maybe I love my internal Irish accent.

Sadly, her books have diminished in quality since her truly excellent debut. The last one I can recommend is Faithful Place, which has her batting .500 at this point—amazing in baseball, not so much in literature.

One of French's strengths has always been developing sense of place. From rural villages to boarding schools to low-income inner city, Ireland has felt alive on the pages of her novels. I'd say 75% of The Trespasser takes place inside police headquarters and the majority of the story is told through interviews. With a mostly one-note lead character and little in the way of compelling mystery, the book is at times an endless slog but never a page-turner.

She does have a way with words, though."
"To be fair, this would be a 3.5 if I had this option (but not quite up to a 4).

I enjoyed this. I'd never read anything by Tana French before since I tend to avoid anything that has 'new york times bestseller' plastered all over the cover. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing, and I enjoyed the story. So much so I have gone back to read the first two in the series - it says it doesn't matter what order they're in since they're all based on different characters (and that, in itself, I like - i do love to find an 'old friend' in a book by the same author - (although nothing will ever make me as happy as discovering characters from In the Skin of a Lion also made an appearance in The English Patient - thank you, Michael Ondaatje) - anyway I have actually found that The Trespasser is the better book of the three."
"I liked, “In The Woods”, so I went and pulled all her books from the library. I love British/ Irish detective novels, and ITW had some juicy, atmospheric, Heathcliff on the moors, stonehegey, raised stone as sacrificial altar stuff that was done brilliantly. But it went on a bit too long with nothing much happening, and now that I’ve finished “The Trespasser”, it has that same thing in common. Lotsa writing without much action. Starting on “Faithful Place”; so we’ll see if Tana is capable of editing herself, had an edit gene splicing, or her publisher bought her one for Christmas. One can only hope. I admire attention to detail and realism as much as the next guy, but a lot of “The Trespasser” read about as dry as a police procedural booklet. It was truly good though, and I do recommend it, but I also recommend Ms French get an editor and use one for future endeavors!"
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad series. This book was not my favorite of the series. It can be difficult to see the world through Antoinette's eyes since she seems to have an epic chip on her shoulder and seems to be a bit paranoid. Don't mistake me, she's in a precarious position as a woman of color on the squad, but the fact that she's sees every action as something targeted against her can get hard to read. That being said that's a big part of who the character is and the internal struggles that she is working through - so it's a masterstroke of character building (even if it might not be enjoyable to read at first). That being said, I also felt like in this book, more so than its predecessors, the victim's death felt like a tragedy. She wasn't the youngest victim, but something about the way that French described this victim left me with a feeling of potential cut off early. "
"Another Tana French, another enjoyable mystery that doesn't quite satisfy. I liked being in the head of Antoinette, a side character in the previous book. She's struggling with harassment and lack of respect at work, and it's led to her being on the edge of exploding at her co-workers and losing her job. But she's also a damn good detective, and has a great rapport with her partner, Stephen Moran (the lead character from the previous book, who I also liked a whole lot). The case in this book, though...it just didn't do it for me. I found the inner workings of the department interesting, but anytime we were focused on the case details I felt the book losing steam. I will be very interested in seeing if French decides to continue this series. I'd like to see a more conclusive ending to the Dublin Murder Squad."
"Book of the Month: November 2016
PopSugar 2021 reading challenge #41

Have you ever started reading a novel, and everything is a decent start: Woman detective working with a bunch of jerks who give her a hard time, even though it is clear she's brilliant.... partner who we're trying to decide if he supports her... a crime that is making us ask a lot of questions... a kind of eerie setting... a really good audiobook narrator...

And then the book just seems to keep going, and going, and going but nothing is really happening? This is just how this book went for me. It had some spark at the beginning and then was just so, so, so slow... and so by the end I was just like, phew, glad we solved this. But I was really not thrilled and cannot say I'd rush to pick up another book by this author.

I'm definitely going against the grain with this rating. But, honesty."
"This final installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series was not my favorite, but was mostly an interesting read. It involved a complicated investigation, fraught with internal intrigue and plenty of red herrings. Two of the newest detectives on the squad are assigned to a case that looks at first glance like a ""routine domestic"" and are pressured by a senior detective to arrest the victim's girlfriend. As the two continue to investigate, they go continually back and forth between believing the boyfriend guilty and believing there must be some other reason why they're being pressured to close the case quickly. But none of the characters was particularly endearing, and the narrative went on and on for too long, especially with Det. Conway's endless self-recriminations. The satisfying ending did help to redeem the novel. 3-1/2 stars"
"Harder to listen to than read- tripped up on the Irish accent and had to keep going back.
Antoinette Conway is on the murder squad, a dreamed of job for her that turns out not to be as she hoped. She is harrassed by fellow squad members except for her partner, Stephen Moran, and given crappy cases. Her current one seems like a love relationship gone bad except a senior fellow cop is pushing her to arrrest the boyfriend, and Antoinette is not convinced he's the guilty one. The murdered Aislinn seems picture perfect in appearance but under that, there is something dark. And Antoinette has seen her before. Another case? There is someone stalking Antoinette, and Aislinn's best friend hints that she was in trouble, maybe another relationship?
Stephen's theory is that there was a gang involved. Maybe there are dirty cops? Accusing one of your own is a tricky business/"
"This is a novel with unexpected philosophical depth. In his remarkable “Homo Deus”, Yuval Noah Harari posits the conscious self as being created by the stories we tell ourselves; this novel draws heavily on conflicting stories that characters tell themselves and the world. The story that Tana French presents as “true” is not the most interesting among them, which is perhaps unfortunate for the reader but may be realistic in that the banality of evil is unlikely to live up to our imaginings.
Tana French's main character is a bully and a boor, but she gets the job done and has enough dimensions not to become a bore. Several of the minor characters are potentially more interesting.
If you harbour romantic illusions about Dublin, this novel will help you get rid of them."
"I have read several of Tana French's books and enjoyed them. This one was definitely a disappointment for me. It is a murder investigation in all its arduous detail led by a female detective that has been less than welcomed by her male peers on the murder squad. The protagonist, Antoinette Conway is less than likable. Trying to fit in, she's rough and vulgar as are her squad mates. A little too much of that for me. The book focuses on lots of retelling of what happened at the murder scene and the backstory of the victim, along with the backstory of Antoinette. It just wasn't an interesting case and the ending, that came out of nowhere, just didn't work for me. Most reviewers loved the book, it just wasn't for me."
"Most books start out fast and drag on to a predictable finish. This one started out at a snail’s pace but had an interesting quick paced finish. Had the editor been diligent, it may have been a four or five star book. As it was I was tired of Antionette Conway’s whining. The only woman in the Murder Squad room constantly being given the “shite” cases with lots of mean spirited teasing and tampering. We didn’t read about it a couple of times to set the stage, it was stage, story, back story etc., for 350 pages. There was a murder to solve in there somewhere and when our author finally got to the case it was interesting with some good twists. Too bad we had to read so much “shite” to find the story. "
"The (as of now) final book in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, The Trespasser is fairly engaging and interesting. The detectives are a repeat from those in The Secret Place, though with a different narrator. They make a great team and I was so pleased that, for once, their partnership does not (entirely) implode over the course of the book. Antoinette is a fascinating character and her narration felt very distinctive from French's other narrators. I did find some issue with the sexism she faces in the squad and how that storyline resolves. The mystery itself is quite intriguing and I liked that the murder victim became a vivid character on her own. I think this book is my third favorite of French's novels after The Likeness & Faithful Place."
"I read this for my book club and I have so many mixed feelings about it. I am sure I will have more after we discuss today, but I enjoyed it yet hard a time with it. I have difficulty with books where I virtually hate every character, and this is a book like that. But, as a friend said, that is more true to life, as virtually no human is perfect in every way. So in that regard I like what Tana French has done. I thought it was an interesting premise, though not my favorite. Definitely kept me guessing literally until the very end. I also did enjoy the ending, it ended not in a way I predicted at all but in a way that satisfied me. I think I would try more of her books, mostly because it just felt like it was a good book, but I am not jumping into reading them. "
"3.5 stars
Now I have read all 6 of Tana French's books, and, per usual, I find them about 50-100 pages too long. However, I do love the way she spins a good murder mystery. This wasn't my favorite of hers, but it certainly wasn't my least favorite. It was a pretty quick read and kept me interested. I couldn't guess who did it, but then again I never can so that isn't anything notable. I really didn't like the main character (and narrator) at ALL and kind of felt like she was mostly ridiculous and whiny, but without spoiling anything, it turns out the author was intentionally making her character like that, so I suppose I can't be too grouchy about it. The characters do curse, so be aware of that, but as far as mysteries go, this wasn't too scary for me, which I liked."
"Tana French is one of my new favorite authors. Funny, snarky and I love the relationship the two detectives have developed since The Secret Place. It's only human to be unsure if someone's got your back, and then to feel stupid for even questioning them. I know French's other novels have different detectives, so it'll be interesting to see how different those novels feel.

As far as The Trespasser goes, I liked how Aislinn Murray was portrayed as a ditzy, airhead. As ""Dream Date Barbie"" with her ""Working Girl Barbie Playhouse,"" but as the novel goes on, we start to see a different side to Aislinn. There are twist and turns, but in the end this was a great read.

I did wish French would have shown Conway telling off Roche though! That would have been great."
"I couldn’t put this book down - the thought process of our protagonist were too compelling. French weaves as much a psychological portrait of a strong but highly insecure female detective, afraid of making herself vulnerable in any way, as a murder investigation. The detective’s self-narrative and her relationships with her squad and her partner are the real pleasure, in fact, of this story, which falls a bit short in connecting the “whodunit” with the “whydunit” - that felt a bit overstretched and unrealistic. Throw in a long lost relative or two, and the murder story lost me a bit. The real question for me by the end: will our protagonist learn to trust just a little more in the universe - enough to keep her around for a future murder investigation? "
"This is not my favorite Tana French book, maybe my least favorite? Maybe it's The Likeness, not sure. In The Trespasser, Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran have to investigate a murder that looks like a domestic violence case. They know something else is probably going on because of the way their fellow detectives act, but they have to fight hard to figure out what's actually going on.

The problem with this book is that, as usual with French, the main protagonist is unlikeable, but in that case she was annoying as hell and I just wanted to slap her in the face. And since the crime itself was not really interesting, this was a loooooooong book covering a boring act, and it wasn't engrossing at all."
"I've heard great things about Tana French's books. This one was the first I'd read of hers. It was good. I liked hearing the voices in my head with their Irish accents. But I did find it a little slow, a little tedious. Although it's part of a series, I didn't feel like I missed anything by not reading the others which is good. It was hard to get a handle on who Antoinette really is (maybe the other books lend to that?), but I did like how it wrapped everything up, and I was disturbed by how things can be spun to look a certain way - whether it's from a murder detective's perspective, a suspect, a friend of the victim, the one who did it, the ones keeping it quiet. For that, I give full credit to the author for keeping the wheels spinning in so many different directions."
"The Dublin Murder Squad series is very good.Winner of the Irish Book Awards Crime Fiction Book of the Year.

Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before."
"Oh Tana, you beautifully eloquent wordswoman. When I read The Witch Elm I knew I had to keep her on my list, but this one fell a little flat for me.

Because of The Witch Elm I expected to be hit left and right with twists at the end, and this police procedural just wasn’t that. I love a cozy mystery, but at 450 pages I hoped for a sucker punch of surprise at the end and it kind of flatlined in the last 50. That’s a lot of pages to not give me twisties, Tana!

I love her writing and she sets scenes really well, but I couldn’t find a character to root for and the victim wasn’t interesting, either. I would put this in the “like” category but not in “must recommend”. Perhaps this is because I didn’t read it in order?"
"Actual Rating: 3.5/5 Stars

While I did enjoy this novel because Tana French is an excellent writer and storyteller, this was not one of my favorites in this series. I had trouble with the main characters Conway and her attitude. It was one of those moments where objectively I knew she had plenty of reason to be angry and the way she was, but it was just so frustrating sometimes especially where Steve was concerned because I just really enjoy him as a character so much from the previous two books. I also just, didn't love the investigation as a whole in this one. I thought it was a very odd book to choose to be the last in this series. It felt more like a middle-of-the-series kind of book. It didn't feel like it packed the same punch that the other books seemed to have. I did still enjoy myself though. It was interesting to see how the mystery played out because I really couldn't tell where it was going at times."
"Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran are assigned to a case involving a young woman named Aislinn Murray, whose body was found dead in her home after a punch to the face caused a fall and blow to the head. Antionette isn’t exactly popular in the detective unit and another detective assisting on the case is pushing her to charge Aislinn’s boyfriend, Rory. Conway and Moran don’t like the urgency being placed on wrapping up this case and have some alternative theories to investigate. The story is very heavy on crime procedures, chasing down every clue, fine points of interrogation, and building an irrefutable case. To make charges stick for the killer she suspects will require irrefutable proof.
"
"This is my second reading of Tana French. Her writing is wonderful in its plot detail and the in the arc of conversations. How did she do that - visibly move the plot along through many lengthy, nuanced oral exchanges with no attendant action?

However, the emptiness of the characters was depressing. The unmitigated anger, the cynicism, the loneliness, along with the stereotypical procedural manipulation of investigative subjects and a visceral contempt for professional colleagues, were all too much for me - especially as narrated by Hilda Fay in an unrelenting voice of paranoid rage.

I will try another Tana French book because her writing is amazing. I wonder if she's applied her skills to something more uplifting than police procedurals."
"Liked the story, did NOT like the characters.

There was a lot I liked about this book, and it probably would have gotten 4 stars from me if Antionette Conway wasn't such an insufferable asshole for like 98% of the story. I don't have to love a main character to love the book-- I couldn't stand Rob in Book 1 and even Cassie could be annoying in Book 2-- but Conway was so unlikable that it was tough to get through hundreds of pages inside her head. In fact, this book is full of unlikable characters, from Conway to Breslin to Crowley and so on. That said, the storyline was good and the suspense kept me reading. I didn't hate it, not at all, but give me Frank or Cassie or a book featuring Moran any day over these jerkoffs."
"This book explores the relationships and rivalries between murder detectives in Dublin. The characters are very interesting and totally believable. The combination of Conway's upbringing and character with the ""old boy"" network of the murder squad is explored at depth. The plot is riveting and keeps your interest up. although it is a little slow towards the end- Why do these books always end at 450 or 400 pages.

I could have done without the huge amount of Irish slang, which became distracting (e.g., gaff = a residence; gaffer = a boss) compared to earlier books. Also ""Me and Steve"" did not sound sound compatible with using 1st person words like ""maudlin"". Is this supposed to make Conway seem totally focused on herself?"
"I read through this book very quickly, and I am not sure why. The characters were, as always, fascinating, and the writing and plot kept me guessing as to who could be the perpetrator. I would say this was one of the less predictable endings among Tana French's book, but one of the more unsatisfying books in terms of the characters' backstory. Even the classic opening of Tana French's books where the narrating character recalls a relevant anecdote seemed just slightly out of place and unrelated to the story, characters, and events later in the book, unlike with other books. But maybe I missed the point. I missed the depth and the darkness and gloominess that I have so easily found in other books by French.
"
"Tana French is unequivocally a brilliant author. With just enough twists and turns to keep the reader engrossed, a solid plot, believable characters, and outstanding imagery, it would be easy to give this book a four or five star rating. My three star rating is based on personal preference. Had I not read Tana's book, THE SEARCHER, and become ""gobsmacked"" by her brilliance, I probably would not have picked up this particular book. Hard core ""cop"" scene and murder mystery is not typically my cup of tea. For those who love a murder mystery with plenty of raw language and ""who done it"" to keep the reader guessing, this book is sure to engage.

I love Tana's writing. I just wasn't crazy about the hard edge to this particular story."
"This book has lots of squad room politics, foul language and Irish slang. I've read four of French's older books and this one has a better story than the others. As with her other books, there are tedious conversations, the story moves slowly, there are no significant surprises, twists or turns and the ending is flat, even though the ending on this book is more satisfying than the other books.

French is very good at describing the atmosphere and the visual surroundings, but describing what her characters look like could be much better . . . it took three books to find out that Detective Steve Moran has red hair and narrow shoulders. I cannot really create a mental picture what Detective Antoinette Conway looks like.

This book might be most enjoyable for a female detective."
"My second book by this author. It was a good book but thought it was a bit long. But I will read more by Tana French.

Conway and Moran usually work the overnight shift but at the end of the night theirgaffer throws them a murder case. A young woman has been found dead in her house and the murder points to the needy boyfriend. Conway doesn’t have best relationship with the others in the murder squad so she is always waiting for something to be pulled on her. This seems to be behind her drive.

She feels she is being sandbagged into arresting the boyfriend by one of the experienced detectives, Breslin, but she’s relectuant to wrap it up too quick when she and Moran have doubts. In the back of her mind she knows there is more to this case."
"The first Tana French book I didn't like. I am sad about that.

1. The narrator was not interesting to me.
2. Her dad stopping by went nowhere. I didn't get the purpose of that.
3. No compelling characters at all, esp the narrator.
4. The victim's story was far-fetched - lacked credibility - and not interesting.
5. The writing at least was good, and the very last scene as well.

It took me forever to finish because it was boring, and the whole case was boring.

I didn't like Faithful Place all that much either, but it was very well-written with round characters and I do think the ending was beautiful and sad. I still gave it five stars. This was the only clunker in the series for me.


"
"I was looking forward to this one. I really like French's combination of police procedural and psychology. But the psychology was more of the sledgehammer variety, doubled up with both the victim and the lead detective sharing a lack of father.

Our central character for this Dublin Murder Squad tale is Antoinette - chippy, prickly, certain that everyone has it in for her, because of both her gender and her skin colour. That assumption grows into a certainty and has a hugely negative impact on her professional relationships and potential for remaining and progressing within the force.

Oh, a murder does gets solved, but the Squad is also left badly marked. Good ending."
"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I kind of want to give it 4 stars but I think that's just because I read it after Rosemary and Lolita...and quite frankly anything would have been good. And yes, I do know that not everyone thinks an intense crime novel is less unnerving than lobotomies and likeable pedophiles. Antionette was an interesting character. I liked her quite a bit. She had integrity and follow through and I liked the interactions with Steve. I thought the storyline was well done and I didn't see what was coming...which made it a good read. I like when I'm looking forward to reading in bed at night. Another excellent book by Ms. French. "
"Please keep in mind, that under the Goodreads rubric, three stars means ""liked it."" So it isn't a bad book. The interplay between Antoinette and her partner, Steve, are good, and there's even some question about their mutual loyalty at one point. Most of the other characters are well drawn also, with lots of interdepartmental intrigue in the cop shop to keep the reader guessing. The mystery is even pretty engaging. I enjoyed the Irish slang (which is new to me). The biggest problem is that the pace of the story bogs down quite a bit in the middle. By the end, when the mystery is solved, I didn't feel particularly gratified. Maybe it was just me ..."
"I find French's books to be pretty engaging when I'm reading them, but the stories and characters don't stay in my mind too long after I move on to my next read. In fact, halfway through this book I looked up the other books in the series to refresh my memory and couldn't believe I had read about these two main detectives before, Conway and Moran. I remembered bits of the book they were in, but nothing about them. I feel like this 6th in the series will have a similar impact, or lack of one. It's a good, fast-paced read, and I figured out the ending well before the detectives did, but I still was interested enough to race to the end. "
"Although I enjoyed this book, The Trespasser by Tana French, I liked the first two books in the series more, particularly #1 In the Woods and #2 The Likeness. Although the storyline was good and 'the blue line"" concept was believable, the credibility of the events and outcomes was a stretch for me. I didn't really care for the primary characters or the narrator of the audio book. Perhaps that influenced my enjoyment of the book. I will continue to read this series but hope that French will return to the more identifiable and believable characters of the first couple of books in this series. I give this book a rating of 3."
"As usual, I love her writing, her use of detail to create a scene. She is so skilled. But I have to say that this is not my favorite book of hers. It felt overlong and a bit boring in places. I found myself just wanting to get to the end. And not really caring. I couldn't connect to any of the characters. Antoinette, the protagonist, was more irritating than compelling. And the bad guy in the end we don't know too much about, so when it turns out he is the bad guy, it doesn't matter so much to the reader. Oh well. I'll still read her books, because even this one was entertaining at times. "
"I like the Tana French series a lot. The atmosphere she catches is awesome, she has a feeling for social issues and a wonderful writing. However, this one is my least favorite one. I did not like Antoinette. She was mean, bitchy for me, a person not very likeable. I very much had the feeling to read a kind of report as when Antoinette talked about the case in retrospective. It did not feel as it would happen right now but was long ago. I missed the writing through the book but it changed to what we know and love towards the end (might be due to German translation). I just wonder, who's going to appear in the next book or if we'll see more of Antoinette and Steve.
"
"I saw this book on a list, put in on reserve at the local library, and it showed up. I really had no idea what to expect having never read Tana French, but I quite enjoyed the book. It is a typical noir-ish police procedural. We learn the events from the first-person perspective of the protagonist. She's an outside in the murder unit with a chip on her shoulder. The story isn't particularly remarkable but the telling is. Another author would write a short story; French gives us a brick filled with the painful mental recountings of her hero. TBH -- my enjoyment may have been driven by schadenfreude. That said, I appreciate a new twist on hard boiled."
Tana French always does a great job creating an enjoyable mystery. The difference for me in how much I like the different books in the series seems to be how engaged I am by the lead detective for each particular story. In this one I just never really connected with Antoinette as a character. I felt like French was trying a bit to hard to show Antoinette and Aislin as two different sides of the same coin in each of their reactions to not having their fathers in their lives. The biases that Antoinette approached the case with as a result of that past and judgment of the way Aislin responded to her own situation became a bit tiresome after a while. 
"Le pongo un tres porque es Tana French, pero me ha decepcionado.
La acción es muy, muy escasa. Se limita a interrogatorios eternos que, la verdad, podrían haberse solucionado de forma más rápida. Y, sobre todo, la protagonista me es profundamente antipática. No coincido con esa idea tan extendida de que una mujer para tener éxito en un mundo de hombres tiene que ser grosera y maleducada. La protagonista lo es, ni ella misma sabe cómo la aguantan, pero continúa en su actitud de soy más macho que vosotros, chicos, y ser más macho consiste en insultar, ignorar los sentimientos de los demás y ridiculez a todo el que s ponga por delante.
French sabe hacerlo mejor. Me ha costado mucho acabarlo"
"Not my favorite Dublin Murder Squad book. It took a LONG time for anything to happen with the case, and Antoinette’s backstory wasn’t engaging enough to really make up for it. That being said, Tana French is a great author. I never wanted to DNF it. I just wanted something to happen, and I kept reading until something did.

I’m still looking forward to (well... hoping for) the next Dublin Murder Squad mystery. I haven’t heard anything about another one, but the way Tana French has it set up (doing this as a companion series instead of following the same character forever) I can’t imagine she doesn’t have more planned. I wonder who the next detective will be!"
"This would have been a good read without all the 'waffling' on. The entire book covers a week in the life of a detective trying to solve a murder case, the trials and tribulations working with a partner and teams within the Murder Squad. There is a of emotion going on in the head of the detective, Antoinette and we read every single thought. Basically, its too much, 'an overload of shite'. The reader finds themselves skipping paragraphs which are not necessary and don't add anything to the pleasure of reading this mystery novel. Whilst the storyline was good, the dialogue wasn't captivating and did not draw you in."
A bit of a tortured plot - seemed like a whole lot of words to tell this story. I liked the characters but it just felt overly complicated. What should have been an open and shut murder case goes down a rabbit hole when it comes to light that the victim had a whole other subplot going on. She was involved in getting revenge for an injustice done to her when she was a girl by a detective on the Murder squad. It is not clear till the end if the perpetrator is her boyfriend or this detective from the past. The two detectives working the case are torn when faced with the possibility of one of their own being involved and the subsequent cover-up.
"I'm a fan of two other books of hers but this one, though still a good read, I did not like as much. Perhaps it was the main character Antoinette that I just didn't like, my impression is that I was browbeaten into understanding that she was angry due to work harassment (understandable) and then paranoid about it - both feelings are completely authentic for those situations but I think reading it multiple times felt like the author thought we were not getting it. Perhaps in another book we revisit Antoinette and her partner Steve as together they made an adorable, likable team. As for the murder itself, I was unsatisfied with the primary motive, but definitely believe it could happen."
"It took a while to get going - possibly due to the fact that (as the detectives point out) the murder victim (and the murder itself) seem a bit, well, boring. To begin with, the scheming and backbiting within the murder squad appears to be the more interesting aspect of the story, but gradually, the case becomes more intriguing. The interview scenes were a definite highlight, love the way the detectives riff off each other to spin their webs and ensnare the interviewee, very Line of Duty! The final showdown between Conway and Moran on one side and McCann on the other, giving as good as he gets until 'the grenade' is lobbed in, is superb."
"Having seen Tana French books on the shelves a lot, I decided to try one. I enjoyed it for the most part. The murder mystery was good, though I felt the author kept going over the same ground quite a bit. But the conclusion was quite satisfying.

I can't say that I liked the lead character. She had a grating personality and there was no compromise in her at all. Though, she had a revelation near the end, which redeemed her a bit, I found that didn't make me like or sympathize with her.

But overall, I did like the book and wouldn't hesitate to pick up another one....just maybe with a different lead character."
Another winner from Tana French - French continues her story line following the Dublin Murder Squad (Garda) this time focusing on Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran. Both figure prominently but the story really belongs to Antoinette has she maneuvers her way through a male dominated squad room - dealing with harassment and pranks that threaten to derail her career. The story is compelling - the murder of a young woman in her flat. It looks like an easy case except Conway and Moran have a nagging suspicion that there is more to it than meets the eye. Could it possibly bring down one of their own? Will Conway leave the job after this case? A fast read and well worth it.
"I love Tana and I enjoy these books for the who-done-it aspect but... I really dislike the main character/narrator. I am not sure if we are supposed to find her insufferable, but I do. He constant poor me, chip on her shoulder bullshit makes me want to smack her. I get it, your a minority and that is tough -- I am a gay, Mexican catholic (former) and I grew up in Utah; I know what it is like. Trust. But the constant pissing and moaning is grating and I am not sure how much of it adds to the story. Sure, some of it does, but it is really heavy in this book. I probably would have given it a 4 if it weren't for that. "
"I haven't read all the Dublin Murder Squad books & by the looks of it, I have missed a few in between; however, it was easy enough to follow as a stand alone.

The 2 detectives in the Murder Squad, Antoinette and her partner Stephen have to solve a murder case involving Aislinn, a young woman who had been known by the police from another case. Antoinette is not well-liked by her peers & she doesn't know who to trust; however, she & Steve do make a great detective pair each not worrying who they will bring down as a result of their investigation.

I found it a bit slow starting, but near the end, I was determined to finish.

A good read!"
"I found The Trespasser to be an overly long book (the audio book was over 20 hours long) with too little action and too much detail. It seemed like the author spent half the book describing Detective Antoinette Conway's paranoia that the rest of the squad was out to get her and Detective Stephen Moran's obsession that Aislinn was murdered by a secret boyfriend who was a gang member. The last quarter of the book did finally pick up and get interested, which is why I'll round up to 3 stars instead of 2 stars, but overall this was not as good nor as interesting as Tana French's other books in the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"***2.75/5 stars***

This was insanely in-depth, and I found it to be pretty info-dumpy sometimes. I can't lie; I couldn't wait for this to be over. It's a great look into the police procedural, but it just dragged way too much for me.
I had a fair battle for the entire novel trying to figure out whether or not I liked the main character, and I can't say I really had an answer by the end. She was great in some aspects, but also really annoying and harsh in others.
I do appreciate the conversations we're having in class about this, though.

Overall, I didn't hate it, but it was definitely not my favorite."
"3.5 stars. I enjoyed the twists and turns of this one, and it definitely kept me interested and curious. However, I've been vacillating in my opinion of the narrator, Antoinette. She's a unique personality, her emotional journey is believable, yet one does want to see her get her head out of her ass sooner rather than later. Furthermore, and this is possibly just because we're seeing the other side of a partnership for the first time (when they're both still around), but I kept getting momentarily confused about who ""I"" was, which made me feel that Antoinette's voice could've been more distinguished from Stephen's. Also, if I hadn't read them back to back..."
"3.5 stars. Just not as good as In the Woods or The Likeness. Mystery isn’t really my genre so the fact that I finished the book still means it was good enough to get through. Tana French is very good at characters. That’s probably why I like her mysteries more than others, because it’s not strictly plot driven. I highly recommend this series if you like mysteries and even if you don’t. You don’t need to read them in order and you don’t need to read all of them. But if you can read them in order it will give them an added depth because some of the characters carry through. I myself have only read #1, 2 and now 6. And I understood #6 just fine. Enjoyable read. "
"My largest complaint was that it came to a point towards the end where every single loose end, every mystery or otherwise is brought together in a nice, neat bow and set in front of you. And then you still have about 50 pages or so to go. Up until that point I enjoyed it, but then it was just so neat and all I could think was, ""oh my gosh, we waited this whole time for one character to just clean up the whole story in a matter of minutes?!"" It's like when the villain explains their entire evil plan to the hero before killing them which gives the hero enough time to come up with some outlandish plan to overpower the villain and save the day. "
"The Trespasser is my first Tana French novel in the Dublin Murder Squad and I liked it more than expected. I think she is an amazing writer and the character development of protagonist Antoinette Conway was knife-edge sharp. The first few interviews dragged a bit for me, but by the end of the book I thoroughly enjoyed the explanation of the cat and mouse game inherent in getting witnesses and/or suspects to tell more than they want. My only problem with the book was, in fact, a foundational premise of the plot. No spoiler here, but Aislinn's revenge scenario just didn't seem plausible to me. "
"I'm not a fan of mysteries, but I liked French's The Secret Place, and I liked The Trespasser too. The narrator here is a wonderfully snarky, somewhat paranoid woman detective who feels rejected by her colleagues and always has her dukes up. Some of her sardonic observations were trenchantly funny, and in general I enjoyed her as a character. The plot line gets a bit byzantine -- that seems par for the course with this genre --and toward the end too much of the exposition is offered through dialogue, but still, I didn't come away thinking I'd wasted my time, which is my usual reaction to mysteries."
"Tana French's novel ""The Trespasser"" is basically a police procedural. A young woman is found murdered in her apartment and our narrator, Detective Conway and her partner Steve, are assigned to the case. Conway is pretty sick of of her entire department and feels they are trying to run her out the door as she tries to piece together what happens.

This isn't really my type of novel, but it was well rated, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't care for Detective Conway all that much (or the coincidences that help lead her to the conclusion of the case.) It may have just been that this isn't really a genre I particularly enjoy, rather than the novel itself though."
"3.25 stars

After 2 disappointing books in the series, I'm pleasantly surprised by this book.

Compared to the other books in the series, which are heavily character-driven, this book is more plot focused with a faster pace. This is how I like my mystery/thriller. I still wouldn't call it plot-driven. Just like all the other books in this series, it's very heavy on characterisation, which is done very well in this book imo. It's told from the perspective of Antoinette Conway, who is one of the protagonists in the previous book. Stephen Moran, the POV character from the previous book, is heavily featured as well. I must say, Conway makes a much more compelling and interesting POV character than Moran.

The mystery of this book is also much more engaging than the previous 2 books. The amount of details in the plot is satisfying so even if you guessed who the murderer is, you won't necessarily guess all the details.

Overall, a solid crime mystery. If you prefer your mystery/thriller more character-driven, you'll love this book. Even if you are, like me, more plot-focused, it's still worth a read."
"3.5*

I always enjoy Tana French's books, but I find that I rarely love them. They tend to go on for a while, and while I do appreciate a red herring, sometimes it just seems like it goes in the wrong direction for a long time. This book was decent in terms of moving quickly and not being too repetitive. I think the plot was good, not great, but solid. I enjoyed Antoinette a lot. I think I just tend to find French's female characters more interesting than her male ones. I also do appreciate that you can read this series out of order and still have it make sense without spoiling too much of other books."
"Nakonec to nebylo špatný, příběh byl pěkně zamotaný a detektivové jej rozbalovali pěkně po vrstvách.

Hrdina, vyšetřovatelka Antoinne, mě část textu štvala, neustále řešila sama sebe, s kým vychází, s kým ne, kdo ji co tropí a na mužském oddělení nechce, až přes své pocity skoro neviděla realitu. Taky nejsem moc fanoušek intuice.
---------------------------
Přijde mi strašně moc divné, že autorka píše detektivky ze současnéh Dublinu a okolí, ale nedrží se jedné sady postav, jednoho hrdiny či detektiva, pokaždé se seznamuju s někým jiným, kdo nedostane ani pořádné obrysy a zase zmizí. I proto její knihy významně nehltám. A taky jsou to většinou pěkně otravní kousci."
"Every now and then, I like a murder book. This was not up to the high standard Ms. French set for herself with the first two Dublin Murder Squad books, but it was fine. The story was slow-moving, a procedural that was methodical to a fault. It seemed obvious early on that 
it could be a cop but the story takes its time getting there. Antoinette Conway is a hard, mean, paranoid, unlikable person, so not the most fun to spend an entire book with, though there's hope for her by the end. Her partner, Steve Moran, seems better than she deserves. I wouldn't be inclined to read another book with Antoinette in the lead."
"Nothing really wrong with the book.
It's not really a book that I would recommend someone HAS to read, and it's not a book I'd reread. It's just a story, with enough of an interest to keep me turning the pages. I'd say it's one of those books you can easily put down when your attention is needed elsewhere in your life. It's not one that will keep you awake at night trying to finish it or a book that you begrudgingly have to pause in order focus your attention on your real life. It's just a story.

There's a lot of cursing - would rate it R. But if you're looking for a book that's interesting enough, but not a time stealer, this would do."
"I was entertained. Of all of the books in the Dublin Murder Squad series, though, this was no my favorite.

Without spoiling it, I just want to say that the element of the main character’s personality I found aggravating turned out to be a necessary event of the plot. So, there’s that. But, that didn’t mean I didn’t struggle to empathize or “cheer” for her along the way. That there were other characters even MORE unlikeable was her saving grace through the bulk of the story.

The quality of the storyline was good. Not great. But, I read the whole book and I do very much quit on a book if it’s garbage.

So, like, read it, I guess? But, if given a choice, read others in this series.
"
"It was good. Well written etc. Did feel as though it took me forever to get through it
and thats with some skimming. The office politics persecution went on and on holy cow
no wonder I suck at office politics, I could never imagine all that even when I did feel
like I was an outsider or being set up. Its a long book and a lot of it is the endless
inner machinations and thoughts. A bit too much for me.

And I felt like they should have stopped the story they set up just before the end.
That was going to set the shite to hit the fan totally needlessly."
"I love love love Tana French but this one was a disappointment for me. I feel like I should take the blame for the feel of this one feeling way too long. Her other books whisked me away immediately and swept me away all the way to the end where by the last page I felt like I was left wanting more and it all ended too soon, this one dragged on for about 200 pages too long. I want to blame my headspace, but I really feel like this one just dragged itself out just a wee bit much. I still love her though and will grab her next release for sure."
"I have read a number of books by this author and thoroughly enjoyed and anticipated the next page(s) through the end. This one dragged through the middle with a lot of self-absorption by the main detective but in retrospect, it is probably a lot more realistic that a murder case takes weeks of back and forth to resolve. In the end, I did not want to stop reading. So the star rating does not really do justice to the intensity of the story. I recommend this book and author to anybody who likes a good murder mystery with twists."
"I'd like to give this more stars based on the simple fact that it's such an addictive read that it had me finish 470 pages in three days. But the Conway character is characterized as so tough that she's unbelievable. There's steel mentality and then there's bravado - the bravado is written in her speech and her thoughts which makes her character over the top. The plot was interesting but Conway's inner monologue had me rolling my eyes at her rolling her eyes. She's tough. We get it. Settle her down a notch and give her some depth, please."
"This book took me F-o-r-e-v-e-r to finish. I LOVE Tana French, and have read all of the other Dublin Murder Squad books. I loved all of them. Tana French came recommended to me by a man working at BookHampton on the North Fork of Long Island and I loved her ever since. I had finished all of Gillian Flynn's books, and was told Tana French was a great author of Flynn's expertise and I agreed- until
This book.
It was not a page turner like the others. It was slow and boring. The last 100 pages were interesting, but it took me awhile to get to those back 100!!!!"
"This is a 3 star Tana French read, but would be a 5 star if someone else had written it. French is definitely one of my favorite authors of this genre. Of the six books in this series, I liked this one the least. It dragged a bit too much and I didn't feel like the characters were as developed. It is ok that I didn't connect with either Conway or Moran but often I felt like I didn't understand some of their behaviors. Still a great read, just not the usual amazing Tana French. I'm ready for another one!"
"I enjoyed a lot of things in this novel. Unfortunately, there was also a lot that I strongly disliked, which was primarily the incredibly SLOW first half. Lots of character development, as per usual with Tana French's novels, but filled with a story line that just kept repeating and going no where until about halfway in. Then we finally get to the good parts, and the wrap up as quicker than I could blink. I loved Antoinette, she was probably my favorite detective protagonist in the series so far. 3 stars. "
"Antoinette Conway of the Dublin Murder Squad attempts to solve the murder of a young woman found dead in her home, without much help from a squadroom full of male detectives not happy with a woman of color in her position. A more straightforward police procedural than French’s early books, but the well-paced and engrossing writing style stays in character. Unfortunately, the story gets dull before the case goes cold and some long sections toward the end could have been summed up with sentences like, “The interrogation confirmed what we knew.”"
"Too, too long a tour for me with this paranoid and angry lady. I'll admit it held my attention. However, writing this several months later, I'm wishing I'd devoted that many hours of reading to something more substantial. I guess that's more a declaration of how I want to spend my time, not a criticism of the book. I read it because it was a my book club's choice. I've been a devotee of mysteries in the past, so I understand the delight; I guess my devotion is waning. It's got some intriguing psychological twists in it that make it a little different."
"Well, to be honest I thought it was just fair to middlin'. Not as good as some of her books, and better than a couple. I felt like every character had to have a go-round with the same set of facts, changing this, moving that, testing something else, supposing this happened, getting a different perpetrator, and starting over again with a new character and a new set of suppositions. It was just too much! Yes, I stuck with it to the end, but frankly by the end I didn't much care anymore.

Like the old saying, ""You can't win 'em all.""

"
"I can see why some people think this book is good, but would not recommend it to friends or just simply feel disappointed. I thought at first this is thrilling and exciting read, as it is in thriller genre. however, I feel more like a literary read when I am finished. the writing is good. author did a good job on portrait the main character, and make you feel that she is just some one among us. things been said, if you are looking for gut wrenching, stimulating, electrifying thriller, this is not the one. "
"Although I enjoyed this story, I have to admit that I didn't feel as engaged with it as I have done with each of the previous Tana French novels I have read. In fact I found that the first half felt far too drawn out at times, not at all like the author's usual taut writing style, and I think that some judicious editing would have improved the balance of the book. However, the second half did redeem the book for me and, as always, I enjoyed the fact that this is an author who knows how to create strong, credible female characters and whose dialogue is so convincing.


"
It usually does not take me a month to read a mystery but I really struggled with this one. Tana French's Murder Squad series has a different protagonist in each book. All the Murder Squad detectives have personal issues but I found the protagonist in this one annoying. Antoinette is a female cop with a chip on her shoulder and some daddy issues. My annoyance with the protagonist had me thinking if I was in any way biased due to her gender. I concluded based on my love of books with female detectives that Antoinette just was not my cup of tea. 
"An enjoyable murder mystery, about 100 pages too long, which could do with some trimming. The Dublin dialogue is snappy, as is the sense of Detective Antoinette Conway's paranoia (one of her coworkers peed into her work locker--but who? Are they all united in tormenting her?). This is not a very collegial Murder Squad, at least towards the lone woman detective. In addition to solving a murder with her partner Moran, she has to battle wits with the very slick Detective Breslin, who is pushing her toward the obvious conclusion... but why? "
"I just didn't buy the ultimate premise for the murder, which drags down the rating for me. I also didn't love how the characters each thought-out-loud for pages upon pages about how the murder could have happened. Once or twice would have been fine, but it seemed like this hypothetical pondering made up so much of the book that there wasn't enough actual action.

I still love Tana French and her writing, and I love the Dublin Murder Squad books, so I'll keep reading, but this one was a bit of a miss for me."
"Tana French has done it again. I love the ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series, and even though this installment took a little while to get on my good side, it managed to do so in the end.

It seems like an easy case. A murdered woman, a suspect with some holes in his alibi, a couple of detectives who are always given the easy relationship crime cases because everyone in the squad hates them. It is only after a good 200 pages that the first cracks appear and the bigger picture begins to emerge. And that is what I love about Tana French's novels. They are slow and subtle, but carry a big punch. And this is a novel about stories much more than about the crime. The crime is secondary to the human element of the book. The stories we tell ourselves to explain the world around us, to make ourselves seem more important, to make our life more exciting. But sometimes, those are simply not true. And when you are forced to realize the truth rather than your own version of your life (however tragic, heroic or exciting you painted it), that is painful. And this book captured that beautifully, besides writing a great crime story with amazingly portrayed characters.

One star off because that conclusion came a little late and too suddenly. I would have liked some doubts and small steps in the right direction a little earlier. Another star off for the protagonist. I love strong women, and Tana French has written them well before, but this was not one of them. Instead of being strong and confident, she was just negative. Everything was bad, everyone against her, everything a lie, nothing positive. But no proper reason for her overbearing pessimistic attitude was ever given. And her opinion of anxiety as ""crazy"", ""stupid"" and ""unrealistic"" was the icing on the cake for me not at all liking her. At the end, that had improved towards a neutral opinion, but she will not be my favorite character from the series, and neither will this be my favorite installment."
"3 and one half stars.BECAUSE she is an excellent writer.This woman Antoinette Conway is BLOODY FABULOUS.So MAD-So ANGRY.
I love her.
Problem is this book is so damn dense.So thick.I'm sorry to say this but at times it really did feel like Required Reading.SO MANY WORDS.
No I don't know the solution.Maybe put in some comic relief or some shmaltz to give us a little break.
I'll say it again. Tana French is a hell of a good writer and Conway is a bloody masterpiece.
But my head is bursting with all this information-and it hurts.
JM"
"I’ve found Tana French to be languorous in her storytelling, slowly, ponderously marching toward the denouement. (I.e. The Witch Elm.)

In this case, (Dublin Murder Squad #6) the careful procedural steps and missteps are necessary. Also, the lead detective does at the end gain some insights into how her own beliefs and prejudices have served her in ill stead.

It is a different character whose hubris leads to a horrific mistake.

My local library does not have all of the Dublin Murder Squad volumes but so far two out of three I’ve read have been decent."
"This murder mystery wasn't as engaging as the other stories Tana French has written. Sometimes, the threads of speculation were lost on me and I'm not sure if that was my short attention span or trite distractions. I felt the murder scene and evidence were too bland and always open to interpretation. In the end, the right confession and not detective work would solve the crime. Regardless, it was a comfort while I endured a horrible week-long cold and I will read another one of her Dublin murder squad mysteries in the future. "
"This is the first Dublin Murder Squad book I read and I don't believe that starting with book 6 of the series really made a difference. It is a decent mystery and the lead character, Antoinette Conway, is at the same time sympathetic and irritating. But the biggest problem for me, in the audio version at least, was the dialogue of the characters. The brogue was so thick that I had a difficult time understanding it. So difficult that I switched to the print version half way through. And still had problems with some of the colloquialisms."
"3 1/2 stars. I love this series of books and love this author. The Trespasser wasn’t my favorite, however. I’m not sure if I just miss the characters from the prior books (especially Frank Mackey), but this one seemed to drag on a bit for me. Still, I will always read Tana French. Spoiler: I thought a better ending would have been for Rory and Lucy to have been the kids (or other family) from Aislinn’s father’s new wife and that they jointly bumped off Aislinn in order to stop her from claiming an inheritance she would have otherwise been entitled to. "
"This was my first Tana French read. I really enjoyed Detective Conway's badassness and attitude, though I did tire of her paranoia once she tried to throw her partner out with the rest of the 'lads.'
That being said, I did like French's take on the unreliable narrator overall.

I thought the mystery portion of the book was lacking, it was fairly easy to connect the dots, and the mystery murder of a 'girl' I didn't know or care about (neither did Conway) didn't propel me to turn pages.

I liked the parallel of the missing/out of the picture dads in the storyline, though our protagonist's line resolved rather quickly and early in the story.

"
I found this a good read but was expecting more after hearing discussion about this author on the NYT Book Review. One of her other titles was being discussed specifically but I'd heard positive talk about her prose before and this was on the shelf at the local library. I think I'll go back to read the first one or two....that may be better than starting with #6. (the one recently reviewed was Witch Elm.) Properly suspenseful ie. it was not obvious who was guilty half way through. The relationship between the two main characters has potential as people I'd be interested in getting to know.
"There have been better mystery books. Maybe Tana French just isn't my cup of tea. I figured out most of the ending by midway through the book. The mystery wasn't interesting. The wild guesses were frustrating as they were clear red herrings. The main character's growth was welcome, but the first 3/4 of the novel she was a walking persecution complex. The dad aspect felt unnecessary, and only there to conveniently move to a conversation that had no bearing on the conclusion.

The writing was fine. The book was fine. It didn't do anything particularly unique or noteworthy."
"I love a good crime novel and this did not disappoint. It was not as good as the Cormoran Strike books but this definitely tickles the crime lovers fancy. The rage that Tana French exhibits in Antoinette’s character is something else. I was walking on egg shells just reading it. But I was lost a bit on her suspicion and callousness. It was a bit much. The overall storyline is fantastic although I felt that were too many routes to get to the point. The gang suspicion and out to get me attitude took up a lot of time. Honestly, Antoinette’s parter, Steve, is the shining star in this book! "
"Although parts of this book are great and very tense, I feel some scenes are drawn out too long. As a reader you keep waiting for the plot to move forward or even twist but I feel that doesn’t really happen. Book is almost predictable and then ant climactic. Still absolutely love the six-part series and I hope French writes more of them, but this was probably my least favorite of her books. Not as many characters you really like and uses two of main characters used in the fifth book, The Secret Place, which was great. "
"If you like interrogation techniques and descriptions how they are conducted, this is a book for you.
It’s about the procedures how to solve a crime, the discussions and theories what happened.
It’s not a fast paced book.
Really non of French’s book are.
But still they are somehow gripping and compelling. Although I did not like any of the characters, besides Steve Moran, this book was captivating.
The story slowed down from one third in, only to take up momentum towards the end.
The conclusion was somewhat satisfactory."
"Overall I would say this book was good but it was quite all over the place. It really delved into the relationships and less on the crime. Also the lengthy conversations between people went on a bit and were only kept afloat by some of the banter. The ending is acceptable despite the long interviews to get to that point. It built up with one of the detectives where you thought, a ha! But then he made his case that things could have happened differently so it was a temporary let down and you thought he was going to get away with it. "
"Overall, The Trespasser was disappointing. Antoinette Conway is not a fun or intriguing or exciting character. Her personal tragedies are predictable and somewhat inane. Her character growth is anticlimactic. Plus, the case in this one was also ho-hum and predictable. Throughout the book, I found myself thinking back to the earlier books in the series and reminiscing on the rich characterization and lyrical descriptions of setting. This one just doesn't hold up. That makes it easier to let go of the series, but it makes me sad it didn't get a more affecting end."
"Like most of the other Tana French books I've read, a family situation sits at the heart of the surrounding mystery and detective work. In this case, it's a daughter's longing for information about a missing father. But what this leads to is a plot setting off the story that struck me as strained and unbelievable. So despite one particularly good interrogation scene of a murder suspect and a feisty female detective as narrator (just one of the characters here who may fit the trespasser descriptor, deservedly or not), my feelings about the book are lukewarm. "
"I've loved all her other books, even though the plots are often more than a stretch, but this book was simply tedious. I just didn't really like the main character, too bitter, which meant that during the sometimes long stretches of time when the plot wasn't moving forward, I felt sort of trapped with her. So I did what I almost never do - I skimmed through some sections until the plot picked up, or there were at least some other characters involved. And, in the end, there wasn't all that much of a twist. "
"There were sections of this that were entertaining but there was far too much dialogue. The novel is about partners Antoinette and Stephen who are handed a case that appears easy enough to solve - a lover's tiff gone wrong. The story takes place in Dublin. However, except for the Irish slang of the characters, it could have taken place anywhere. There's no Irish flavor or atmosphere otherwise. The story contains little action. The book's 449 pages are nearly all witness and suspect interviews spanning only the 4 days it takes to solve the case. "
"This wasn’t a bad read, but it could have ended a lot sooner. The story kept going in the same circles. Antoinette worked in a tough environment. I understood that; guy cops who didn’t want a woman in their circle. But it was repeated and repeated and repeated. She and her partner Steve took on a tough case, and the powers that be didn’t want them to solve the murder they were assigned to. What I really enjoyed was the narrator of the audiobook version I listened to while walking. I was more focused on her Irish accent then the actual story. "
"3.5 stars rounded down. This book had many of the things I love about a Tana French/Dublin Murder Squad story. I enjoyed the plot surrounding solving the mystery. I was pleasantly confused about who committed the murder and why until close to the end. My main problem with the book was the lead detective on the case. I have no patience for whining, everyone's out to get me, why can't you just understand and give me a break, women. And there was a lot of that in this book.

The ending redeemed the story for me, but not enough for me to round up instead of down."
"3.5 stars.

Detectives Conway and Moran are now officially partners on the murder squad. As they are finishing up a night shift a new case comes in: an anonymous caller has reported that a 20-something woman is severely injured in her home. It turns out that the victim was dead and although the obvious suspect is her new boyfriend, something isn't quite adding up.

This whole series is enjoyable and always keeps me guessing. I hope there will be more! My only complaint about this series is the ample use of the F-word."
"Hmm unfortunately I didn't love this book. The main story was good but there was so much fluff around it, this book was unnecessarily long. The only reason I finished it is because I really wanted to learn what was the conclusion of the case, and then the end was too long too.
I also disliked the main character so much, her tough girl act and everyone-is-out-to-get-her story got old very quickly. I wanted to root for her at the beginning, I wanted her to be a bad ass and put all those guys in their place but then it felt like she was fighting shadows."
"This was my least favorite of Ms. French's books, because I pretty much figured out the culprit by chapter 4 and Conway was so insufferably whiney. I did read the last chapter to make sure I wasn't mistaken about the murderer. Tana French usually steers me in one direction and then leads me through a corn maze. This time, I'd pretty much hit the nail on the head. I briefly (about 20min) deliberated whether to stop or not. However, Tana French writes so beautifully and creates such lovely characters, I had to find out what she was going to do with these. However, I am well satisfied with the novel as a whole, and I totally recommend reading the book start to finish."
"I have mixed feelings about this mystery novel. After the first 200 pages, I was so tired of the main character, who is extremely angry all of the time (mostly justifiably) that I almost gave up and dropped it. Then after a plot change, I became more interested and read the book more quickly. However, by the end, I was really ready to stop reading again. I think the problem was the obsessive characters as well as the style of the writing was eventually wearing me down. I will probably read this author again, but not for a while. I need a good long break."
"I did really enjoy this one. It was smart and extremely well written. However, it was so needlessly long. At 450+ pages, it was a slow build and lost some steam midway, though it really picked up the last 100 pages. One major problem was the very long scenes and interrogations. It was easy to lose interest in a chapter after dozens of pages of dialogue from the same conversation. Nonetheless, the twists were good. If I could give half stars, I'd rate this 3.5, and I think I would give other Tana French books a try."
"I usually enjoy the Murder Squad books much more than this one. The mystery and the crime were entertaining enough, though it was transparent quite early on who the real suspect was. They drug that out far too long. My main problem was Detective Conway and her negative attitude. She was just so incredibly unpleasant throughout the entire book! She had many good reasons to be angry and irritated, but the depth of her hostility and her vulgar speech made her so unlikeable! I hung around just bc I wanted to see if there was a further surprise at the end, but there wasn’t. "
"I gave this book 3 stars, but it was more like a 2.5 to me. It started off good, with an interesting murder mystery. The the bulk of the book dragged on and was super repetitive, with continuously mentioning the same theory the detectives had about the case. I couldn’t wait to be done reading it. The reveal of “the twist” was very anti-climatic in my opinion. I also kept getting confused with the number of detectives and all their different names. I had to just focus on the key characters and keep moving on. Overall would not recommend. A disappointing read for me."
"I have read many Tana French books. This was the least enjoyable one, for me.
I found it choppy. The book had some twists and turns that were difficult to follow. It took me a long time to understand the gang and the crooked cop tangents.
I did not particularly like any of the characters. I don't have to like all the characters in a book, but I do need to have some feeling for at least one of the characters.
I do like the theme of everyone has a story. The book used that theme throughout. I wish it had been less choppy.
"
"I found this a struggle to read, like wading through treacle. Having said this, the writing was so detailed and inciteful of the police procedure and the thought processes of the main character. The whole book only spanned a couple of days, such was the minutiae of the prose.
I didn't realise this was one of a series and hadn't read any of the previous books, I don't know if I had, that this would have made me appreciate this more. It isn't necessary to read the others as this is a stand alone story."
"A slow go

I didn't like this Tana French novel anywhere near as much as her earlier work. The story sets up quickly, but bogs down in the second act to the point where I was tempted to abandon the book without finishing it. But just as I was about to give up, it finally picked up pace and lured me back to stick with it to the end. I do like Frenchs writing style and enjoy the Irish voices, but someone should have done some deep cutting in the midsection of this book."
"I do like TF (Murder detective Antoinette Conway) but aspects of this Dublin cop crime thriller were too unbelievable...even for the likes of me. The title has me puzzled and that is important to me. Should have engaged with fellow readers who are smarter than I and let them explain it to me. Shouldn't be that difficult. I will try another TF novel. Hope the next one is as good as ""In the woods."""
"This book is too loquacious, using fluffy and non-descriptive descriptors to talk about very simple feelings. There's also a ton of redundancy in language and actions, making the book longer than it should be. There are some bright spots, entertaining and fun to read. I liked the peek into detectives' worlds and their jobs. But the silly language and the main character's unwillingness to get out of her own head ruined it for me. "
"Number 6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Loved them all. Lots of plot twists and turns, and lots of behind the scenes character development. Definitely relatable themes - love, loss and abandonment, gender discrimination in traditionally male roles, well- meaning authority figures withholding information and the effect that decision has on the lives of others. Lots of colloquial Irish expressions keep a reader focused on a great story. Tana French is a gifted writer. "
"If you like standard murder mystery fiction, this is a good pick. Easy read, no big surprises. I've only read one other book by author, though this is the 6th in a ""series"" you don't need to read them in order. Seems the protagonist is different in each of the books - what loosely ties them together is that they are members of the Dublin Murder Squad (and, who doesn't want to read a good story set in Dublin?)."
"I really enjoyed Faithful Place, and I really wanted to enjoy this book, but none of the elements I liked in Faithful Place are here.

Way too much time is spent on the idea that Detectives are magic people who can tell what's going on inside a person's head by how they move their eyebrow and every interrogation technique is psychological trick because all people think, move and react exactly the same. The premise of the mystery was too thin, built on nothing much."
"En regardant le bandeau ""grand prix du roman policier irlandais"" j'en attendais beaucoup pour mon premier Tana French.
Peut-être trop ?
L'histoire est sympathique, les personnages attachants. J'ai parfois eu un peu de mal avec la paranoïa de l'héroïne l'inspecteur Antoinette Conway. Est-ce vrai ou non ? Que peut-il lui arriver.
Je trouve que l'histoire est intéressante mais plus de 500 pages pour évoquer cette théorie c'est probablement trop.
Verdict sur l'auteure au prochain roman."
"I want to like the DMS books more than I do. Despite all the tangled threads she weaves, figuring out the whodunit in French's books is still accomplished before I'm halfway through the book. Maybe that's by design, but why would an author want readers to spend the rest of their reading experience wondering WHY the detectives haven't figured it out yet?

I will say the pairing of Conway and Moran is my favorite, and I hope she sticks with them a while."
"The detective needs to get some medical help to deal with her anxiety, depression and paranoia. Or at least get more sleep and some food. I almost didn't finish after listening for the third time how the streets were closing in on her and the trees were trying to grab at her in the looming darkness and EVERYONE was against her from the time she was a child. But I wanted to see if my guess was right on how the girl died so I continued on. Way too long of a book for a simple whodunit."
"This book really deserves 3.5*'s. It was very well written mystery, with a great character study of the lead detective. It is also a look into the police work of Dublin's Murder Squad, how they operate and the inside goings on....to me some of the most fascinating parts were who the lead detective and her partner worked the case, their thought process and how they got to finally figure i out..... "
"I have found a new author to follow! This was a really good read and I look forward to more Tana French novels. It also spoke to me regarding what love can do to you (a serious ring of truth for me), ""It means someone else has hold of your whole life. At any second,[]they could decide to change it into something else. You might never even know why. And you might never get it back, your life. They can just walk out and take it with them."""
"Really struggled through this one, for some reason. Tana French is a hell of a writer -- I especially loved the descriptions of witness interviews -- but the story seemed so plodding and slow, I found myself not looking forward to picking the book up. I was more relieved than pleased to get to the end. All in all, it didn't really live up to my expectations, given the raves about this particular author. Maybe I'm just not that keen on murder mysteries. "
"Disappointing! I enjoyed French's The Likeness so much, I talked about the plot with random friends. The Trespasser... bleh. Slow start, and once it picked up, I found the motivations behind the main plot that led to the murder to be hard to believe. I appreciate the writing, and I was so intimidated by one of the characters that French could have used him anyway she chose in the end. She didn't much, as it turns out. A miss, I believe."
Got really annoyed with the lead character about half way through the book. Seemed like such a whiny drama queen who just sucked all the abuse from her coworkers up. Yes there are terrible work places and coworkers. Look at the current Me2. She did not seem able to think beyond revenge like punching people and possibly changing jobs. I guess we all have low pints like that. The end of the book made up for it.
"I have read a few of Tana French's other novels and have always enjoyed them. This one however I found quite different. I felt the story was somewhat slow and drawn-out with considerable detailed police procedurals and long witness and suspect interviews. Also, some of the unfamiliar slang language takes a bit of getting used to. Although not my favourite of her novels it was an interesting read ... almost instructional in how to be a good thorough investigator. "
"Loved the style of writing, loved the characters and their hilarious jibes at each other ... I just felt the plot was a bit weak and lacking substance. This is why (I think) it took me so long to finish. Instead of true detective work there was a lot of made up scenarios based on no evidence. The big shocker on the cover of Conway recognising the victim - very loose thread! All in all I think I just picked up the wrong novel but I would definitely read another to prove myself wrong."
"Cop murder mystery set in Dublin. It took me a couple chapters to get into the swing of the lingo and the back and forth between dialogue and commentary, but once I got into it, things were good. I glanced through the blurbs on the rest of the series. Interesting concept to have them all based on the Murder Squad, but different characters and different times. I may go back and read the book prior to this one, which actually did have the same characters."
"After reading Faithful Place, I moved quickly onto The Trespasser. Big mistake.
I loved the main character in Faithful Place (Frank Mackey) but I could scarcely tolerant the Trespasser's female detective Antoinette Conway - Her whiney, poor me demeanour made me want to throw the book against the wall several times! I also have Tana French's ""In the woods"" on my bookshelf - I might wait a bit on that one."
"Oh look, I finally finished a book!

All in all, I liked this book but it took a while for me to get into it. I don't really like Antoinette, so following her head space for the book was a little much. BUT, she had a revelation about herself at the end that was necessary (thank goodness), and I did not see that ending coming (it wrapped up very well), so overall it was a great addition to the Murder Squad series!"
"Skill 4, Enjoyment 3. This is my second Tana French novel and it’s as dark and sometimes depressing as the first, In The Woods. I can’t say it’s not well written—it is, and it manages to do a few things not often tried in the murder procedural genre—but it is hard for me to get through a book that is so pessimistic. French doesn’t give you what you want, and I admire that, but I also, you know, don’t like it. Listening to this on audiobook with an Irish narrator really helped the scene-setting, and she gave each character a distinct voice and accent."
"Jamaican me crazy

It's no Rob and Cassie, who I still miss terribly, but get thru the first half and it has you. Not as great as her first 2 or as good as her third, but not as bad as those since. I didn't even hate the ending! (Which with Tana I thought was a given...) Still desperately wondering what happened to Rob's childhood friends (or Rob, for that matter,) and thoroughly hating that Daniel died.
"
"For sure, not a quickly paced, action packed detective story, so if that’s what a reader is looking for, this book might be disappointing, but... If you love crisp dialogue sprinkled with Irish vocabulary and phrases, interesting characters, complicated relationships, a few realistic twists, and a satisfying conclusion, then this book is for you. The Trespasser isn’t my favorite Tana French novel, but any Tana French novel is well worth reading. "
"I'm not going to recap the story, other people have done that. Once again, Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran work together to solve a murder. Conway leads the way with on the murder investigation with Moran in tow. Most of the story takes place in the Murder Squad room, which I found mundane. The story was dragged on and on. I stuck with it because I kept hoping it would get more engaging and during the last few chapters the story picked up and the culprit is identified. "
"I read In the Woods years ago, when it first came out, and I loved it. Then I read the next book Ms. French wrote, and I liked it but not as much as her first novel. Fast forward many years - I decided to pick up The Trespasser. I'm lukewarm on it. I didn't like the main character, who just wasn't very ... well, likable. Nor were the others. And there was very little action in the story. I like character-driven stories, but I need more than just a lot of dialog and internal narrative. "
"The reason I give this book such a rating has solely to do with my complete and utter dislike of the main character. I found her loathsome (and I normally love strong, ballsy lead heroines). The story was great, the writing was great, but I truly hated the lead. If it had been written from any other character’s POV, it would have gotten a perfect 💯 from me. But I’ll be glad to completely forget this character and the time I wasted with her as soon as I can. "
"Good solid mystery by Tana French but three stars simply because it doesn’t compare with her other books, particularly the first three.
I know I’m in the minority here and, in part, it may be because I listened to the audio version. The thick Dublin accents on most of the characters were often hard to decipher, causing many replays. The book was overly long for the plot and just didn’t have suspense I expected from Ms. French’s books."
This is my 2nd Tana French book this summer. There are good page turning moments and also a lot of eh moments. I’m very much wondering how much the words gaff and gaffer were used. It was distracting. Twists and turns abound and it was entertaining enough. A murder detective doesn’t know who she can trust and thinks the whole crew is out to get her while she tries to solve a murder. Ending isn’t that surprising.
"The first half of this book was tedious, but since it is Tana French, I read on. I understood that a murder case with few clues doesn't make for great fiction, and that was the point. Once things got interesting, they got really interesting and I devoured the second half of the book. I would give it 3 1/2 stars. I just didn't love it or become so fully engrossed in the story and, in particular, the place as I have with her other novels. "
"""What'd you talk about?"" ""Books, mostly. Aislinn was leafing through a collection of George MacDonald fairy tales; I loved that book when I was little, so I told her that, and she said she loved it too - we'd even had the same edition.""

This was the most redeeming moment in this novel full of characters that I couldn't stand. This one is dark and disturbing but then a decent murder mystery should be, especially from the pen of Tana French. Well written as usual!"
"Tana French is an outstanding writer. She writes as if she had been a detective before and knows the ins and outs of an investigation and the locker room mentality of the squad room. Her bio, though, bio says she was an actress. The pacing and the characters are striking and unique how the supporting characters of each book become the main characters in the next in this Dublin Murder Squad series!"
"Honestly, I did not enjoy this as much as the previous one ""The secret place."" While I appreciate the seemingly realistic pace of a murder investigation (the interviews, the witness statements, paperwork, the what ifs etc), I still think the pace of this book is way too slow. And the mystery itself...isn't my favorite. The morality of the Dublin Murder squad is questionable in this book, and a few things still don't add up in my head (the cooker! why the cooker?!)"
"This was a very long and wordy book about the murder of Aislinn Murray. Antoinette and her partner, Steve, are D's in the police department. The book was written in an Irish dialect and it was sometimes hard to understand what was being said. Antoinette is an angry woman and holds a lot of grudges against her detective squad. She felt everyone was out to get her and sabotage her investigation."
"I love Tana French. But this one didn’t work for me. The story was drawn out and kind of boring. And so much of the plot felt unbelievable - the things the detectives believed, the things the victim did, and the murderer. All of it. And the main character wasn’t very likeable. I get why she’s like that, but it was still a problem.

I’ll just hope for better next time, because I usually really like her novels."
"3.5, teetering on a 3. I liked how this kept a hold of me, never truly gripping but keeping me a steady level of interested the whole time. The what-ifs and counter-theories the detectives were coming up with always felt far-fetched, though. Conway was an interesting character, written well, but left me a little frustrated as her lack of empathy felt like a convenient way to leave her closed-off to other perspectives."
"I'd say The Faithful Place and The Likeness are two of my favorite Tana French novels, but this one is very good. Best read after The Secret Place, as two of the detectives (Antoinette Conway and Steven Moran) reappear in this mystery. In The Trespasser, what looks like a run-of-the-mill murder soon escalates into something very, very different. When are there going to be movies made of the Murder Squad books?!!"
This is my first Tana French book. I was looking forward to it as I have heard her compared to Ruth Ware and love Ware's writing. I enjoyed the ending of this story but overall the book was way too long. It felt like it took forever for the story to really start and it could have been 100 pages shorter and told the same story. I was disappointed as I don't know if I'll read more by this author and was hoping to love this book and have a new go to author. 
"This is a tough book for me to rate. I got a bit tired of it after the first 200 pages. It seemed tedious. At that point, it caught my interest and I became completely immersed in the plot. I read the rest of the book in one sitting and thought the ending was brilliant. All I can say is, that for me, in the end, the long journey was worth the patience it took me to get there. Tana French is an amazing writer! I’ll be looking for another of her books right away. "
"I’m not much into detective stories but I enjoyed listening to it because of the Irish accents. There were a few times I was stumped so it wasn’t as predictable as I thought it would be. I didn’t realize it was not the first book in the series until after I started, but it wasn’t confusing for me. The main character was in a constant state of paranoia so this made the tension in the book feel more intense. "
"A fun mystery, recommended by the book club although actually they intended to recommend The Searcher. I enjoyed it, and would be interested in reading some of the earlier books in the series, but did feel a little weird about the recommendation because it's a fairly standard mystery. An enjoyable one, with some interesting twisty elements but something I could absolutely see written by JD Robb or another author. The intent to recommend The Searcher resolved the biggest mystery for me.
"
"I can’t get enough of the Dublin Murder Squad series, and I especially like Detective Conway’s take-no-prisoners attitude this time around. This murder had a few twists and turns alright, and various theories as to whodunnit and why. French’s ear for dialogue and dialect is perfect, her characters are strong and well rounded and the pace is as quick as a real life Murder investigation. Overall, a grand tale and as satisfactory an ending as we could hope for."
"I want to rate this book more highly, because once the story got going, it was a good story. My 3-star is based on how slowly the book started - it took way to long to tell us how the main character felt she was the outsider. I felt like, yup - we get it - let's move on. But the back 2/3 of the story was great, well put together, and definitely had me not wanting to put it down. I'll read other Tana French books for sure. And my advice on this one is to stay with it."
"Too predictable for the time it takes to read this tomb. For how detailed Tana French's writing is, the characters were disappointingly one dimensional. To be fair, this is book 6 in a series so I may have missed long-term character development. I did enjoy getting in the head of a detective and understanding her thought process. If you like Law and Order and Sherlock this book is a great listen, but I would not put the effort into reading it."
"I really wanted to like the book, but I found it to be rather tedious and slow moving. The first person narrator frequently covers the same ground. Typically when I read a murder mystery, I get caught up in the action and cruise through it. With this one, I often asked myself where the editor was, i.e. it would have been a better book at 250 or 300 pages rather than 464.. I also found the motivations of the victim to be unconvincing. "
"While I do love a good detective story, I found this one to be a bit long-winded. I thought some elements of the story were drawn out unnecessarily while other elements weren't fleshed out enough. I also found the relationship between Conway and the other men in her squad to be a bit unrealistic or far-fetched. I was hoping for more suspense and intrigue, but the story was more of a tried-and-true police procedural, which if it was the goal, it was nailed right on the head. "
"I'm giving this one 3 though its probably closer to 4 on my ease in returning to it. I really like Antoinette. Tana French is an extremely reliable writer. I feel like I'm an extended vacation in Ireland when I read her books. I think I've read all of them? Though being middle aged I can't really remember who the other members of the Dublin Murder Squad are. It would be fun to one day reread them in order. LOL, middle age. "
"Well written, and a good story. I found myself trying to read while doing dishes, folding laundry, etc by the climax of the book. But. I really really had trouble liking the main character. I wanted to smack her upside the head. Thankfully by the end she managed to whittle down the size of the chip on her shoulder, but only just. It made me wonder if every detective was suspicious of everyone, all the time, including their colleagues, partners, and friends. What a depressing notion. "
Ah the final book in the Dublin murder squad series. By the end of these (6) books I think I have had enough of the squad. The stories were great with some interesting revelations but in the end i grew tired of the antics and inter-squad feuding. I found the books got weaker as they went along as well. I would have love to see certain characters return and finish some business that was left unfinished but I guess that will never happen.
"3 stars only because she salvages it in the last 100 pages or so. The rest of the book is uneventful at best, and exhausting at worst. The repetitive plot point of “they all hate me, they’re out to get me” gets very tiring after a point. It’s still the same old Tana so I didn’t hate it but I was just bored and skipping whole paragraphs in the last 25% of the book.

Ends well though so this is that rare occasion where I’m glad I stuck it through."
"Not my favorite book in this series but still solid. After reading the entire series I have to say overall I like this author. I'm going to check out her other ones that not part of this series as well. This one was just ok. The lead female character with the daddy stuff felt kind of weak to me but overall it was well written and kept me turning those pages. I think my favorite in this series was ""The Secret Place"" followed by the Likeness."
I really have enjoyed reading this author but this particular novel was extremely difficult to get into. I was bored with all of the angst of the main character. I kept putting it down and reading other things. The intricacies of the squad room dynamics weren’t interesting to me. I stuck with it as I tend to do. Glad it picked up in the last third of the novel. Decent finish. But it took me forever!!!!
"This one was not my favorite of the series. I was frustrated with Antoinette even as I am understood why she’d feel the way she did. The chip on her shoulder is made of lead, and her lack of empathy for anyone was grating. I was frustrated that the D’s kept focusing on why the Vic’s BFF would tell her to “be safe!” when going on a date. Of COURSE that’s what you say! Anyway. I’m bummed the series is over but looking forward to her we release. "
"I think this is my second book by Tana and I liked it much better than the first. Solid, interesting plot, lovely writing and descriptions, she’s a great writer and I enjoyed it.

HOWEVER. It loses a couple stars for the awful Antoinette. The MC was so extremely unlikeable, paranoid, annoying, and… kind of bad at her job? All while bragging about how bad ass she is. Pass on her, her partner saved this book for me. I get wanting to have an edgy flawed MC, but for me she was just mean and whiny."
Too much time of this novel was wasted on a plot line or a line of investigation that was illogical even to the reader. I liked where this novel ended up but I think a good third of this novel should have been refocused on investigating the true culprit rather than phony gangs. The partnership between Antoinette and Steven was strong and entertaining to read. I struggled to connect with Antoinette but she does grow and I really did appreciate the journey that she went on. 
"Not Tana French’s best, but a well written story overall. Antoinette is like an overgrown teenager who needs a piece of perspective that it’s not all about her: I wanted to shout at her to get out of her own way so many times (at times- her bad attitude made it almost impossible to keep going), and Aislinn and Lucy’s friendship was lovely. A predictable twist overall, but still a fun summer read! "
"Though not as strong as the first four books of the Dublin Murder Squad series, I still enjoyed this one. These books can be read as standalone, so had I just picked this up as my first Tana French novel, I’d have probably rated it higher. Tana French knows what she’s doing. Detective Conway carries this story through, I loved her character and thought she was one of the stronger detective POVs of the 6 books. I’m sad to finish this series, and wish there were more.
"
"A big fan of Tana French Dublin Murder Mystery series. This one did not disappoint and held my interest. It was fun that the two main characters had been in previous books in the series as well.
I have read all 6 of this series. For me, the first one - The Likeness - was the best. But they are all easy to read and hard to put down."
"This is a solid addition to the Tana French Dublin Murder Squad series. Not my favorite of the set, but Detective Conway is one of funnest to read. The Trespasser is more about the politics of a homicide squad, and how gender factors in. French is the best fictional crime writer out there, and The Trespasser doesn't disappoint, it's just not as exciting as some of her others."
"This one was better than her last one, though that's not really a huge compliment. But still not nearly as good as her first few. It started off interesting but lulled really badly in the middle, and so many of the tangents the detectives went off on were just too stupid to be believable. The result was that I felt annoyed for large chunks of time while reading."
"2.8. The last quarter of this book saved it. Definately not one of French's stronger works, which is disappointing. Out of all six of her books, the only ones I haven't really enjoyed all the way through are Broken Harbor and this one. The first 2/3 of the book felt sooooo slooooooow. Lots of police procedure and heavy on the interpersonal dynamics of the murder squad. "
"It's funny: as I was reading, I kept wondering whether I liked 'The Trespasser' or not. I kept wondering what the title meant. I kept wondering if I liked Conway, or Moran, and if I cared about Aislinn. And I kept reading. I guess my final decision is that mysteries by French, even when they are flawed or just not my favorite, are still absorbing and entertaining enough to keep reading."
"This was a very gripping read - I stayed up too late finishing this, which I don't do often! Loved the language and characters in the book. I could feel the main character's frustration as she circled around and around the dead-end leads and theories - but too much frustration, it made the book drag in the middle and just wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been with a bit more editing."
"So surprised this book appears on several ""best of"" lists for 2016. I read it all and found it interesting but wasn't terribly surprised and had to sog my way through too much long,, information giving dialogue. The narrator annoyed me with her everyone's against me attitude. This won't send me off looking for another Tana French novel."
"Listened. Well-read but overly long. This one is about Antoinette Conway in her early days with the murder squad. She and her partner Steve Moran investigate the murder/manslaughter of Aislinn Murray, and Conway is constantly thinking that the members of her squad are out to get her. Maybe they are, maybe not. Too much angst for me, but a good story well told nonetheless."
"All reading is subjective. It depends on one's mood and everything else going on at the time. I listened to this book during a bout of cabin fever. Snowpocalypse happened and many of us stayed inside for a few days. I have been a Tana French fan, but the last two books seemed over-wrought. It might be time to move on to something else."
"Listened to this as an audiobook. Very good reader, but it took a while for these ears to be completely familiar with the accent.

The story and outcome turn out to be much less confusing that the stories that are told by narrator and her colleagues. I enjoyed it, but as police procedurals go, this one is quite different."
"Meh. A little too long and overwritten. Detective Conway and her partner get a murder case that seems like a slam dunk. However, they dig a little deeper much to the chagrin of a few fellow detectives who appear tied to the case somehow. Most of the characters were assholes and it took too long to read. "
"Listened. I think audio 1st person must sometimes make it tough for a narrator to distinguish between inner monologue and dialogue. This was mostly well, if not perfectly, done here. Just misses an extra star due to a bit of a bloated middle that caused some toe-tapping - one too many twists spun there I think. "
"Well, I used to love Tana French. Her mysteries involving the Dublin Murder Squad were fascinating psychological thrillers--and so well written: Some of her descriptions took my breath away. (See: In The Woods; The Likeness; Faithful Place)

My breath, alas, stayed with me for this one. It wasn't the murder--that was interesting. It wasn't the wrap-up or take down, or lack of clues. All of which were pretty good. It was the main character, Detective Antoinette Conroy was so, well, unlikeable is putting it mildly. She has a nasty opinion of everyone; believes she's being discriminated as the only woman in the all-male murder squad. Whether we're privy to her thoughts, or reading dialogue; she's rude and despicable ALL THE TIME.

I found her so unlikeable, it really ruined what would've been a pretty good yarn. Oh, it was also verrrry long, way too detailed. A lot of pages of Antoinette being miserable before anything actually happens. I was disappointed."
"This book was okay. It was more about the squad dynamics and the characters' responses to various things and events than the mystery. The mystery itself was interesting but the ending was a bit anti-climactic. Great writing as always, and I hope there are plenty more books from French to come in the future- it's always fun to see which character she chooses to highlight next. "
"I really do like French's writing and, while I enjoyed the novel (and, to be honest, I listened to this one on Audible), it was WAY too long and could have benefitted from a good editor. Also, I found Antoinette to be WAY over the top in paranoia and the chip on her shoulder was the size of a redwood. I appreciate a bit of subtlety.

A compelling mystery with lots of twists and turns, though."
"I listened to this on audio and while the Irish accents were delightful I can't help feeling like I would have preferred reading this one in print. It got TEDIOUS and OFTEN. I feel like I would have skimmed a good portion of this puppy to get to the good stuff, which like everyone noted, consisted of the interviews. Genuinely fascinating. Otherwise, meh. "
"I've really enjoyed French's previous Dublin mysteries--well plotted, with interesting psychological complexity and sharp observations about class politics. But this book felt tired--I saw the twist coming a mile away, and there were just way too many unbelievable coincidences that drove the plot. I'm hoping her next book returns her to her usual fine form."
"I love Tana French. If she wrote a menu I would read it. All that being said, this book was not my favorite. Back with the Dublin Murder Squad, but again a switch in POV from the previous book, I had a difficult time with the female cop this time. She made decisions that were so self destructive I found them hard to believe. If you have to skip any in the series, this is the one."
"Not my favorite Tana French by any means. The case wasn't that compelling to me and I just couldn't relate to Antoinette, who had such a giant chip on her shoulder I found her very unlikeable. Got more interesting the last 100 pages or so, but definitely wasn't the page turner her first few novels were."
"I would have enjoyed this book more if I could have handled Antoinette better, I just got tired of her personality after a while - I thought it got a little over the top after a while, constantly hammering to us how tough/not GAF she was. This didn't measure up to other Tana French reads for me, although I found the mystery entertaining enough.



"
"Stick with it!

I almost quit with 200 pages left. It was moving so slow, and the main character's ""the world is against me"" attitude was driving me nuts. I had also already figured out who did it...but I stuck with it, and it really wrapped up nicely. I think it could have been much shorter, but I thought the ending tied it all together really well."
"Muh... This book was way too long. There are chapters of nothing but talking and the main character's introspection. I felt a lot of it was repetitive and the thoughts going through the mind of Antoinette were being forced down my throat. The mystery is interesting, but gawd it takes a very long time with too much talking to solve the murder."
"3.5 stars. I enjoyed it and I was hooked for the last quarter, but I really didn't like it as much as her other books. It was a little slow for me, and for a while I felt tired of the squad drama. But I'm happy with the ending and overall it was a good read! I really hope she writes more books with Antoinnette Conway."
"I have mixed feelings about it. It's a little hit-you-over-the-head with the themes, and frankly no one does detective genre better than Kate Atkinson. So everything else disappoints, but I read it through. And it does give you a good sense of how horrible it is to be the only woman in a workplace without a lot of hyperbole, for those who have never experienced it."
After reading the reviews I discover that Garda Conway was introduced in a previous book which I have not read. Perhaps reading the earlier book which would cover why she was so disgruntled with The Murder Squad would have made her attitude easier to understand. I didn't really warm to her but it was quite a good story with some solid detective work in there.
"I love her writing, but I didn’t enjoy this book nearly as much as her others. I wasn’t interested in the main character as much as I thought I would be. This was more about her than about the mystery. I’ll keep reading her books, but I think I might reread the first few to remember why I like her books usually."
"The plot of this book was not entirely good. It wasn’t very exciting or thrilling like I was expecting. However, it was so well written that I decided to keep reading to the end. The author has a real talent for descriptions, I could picture everything vividly but it wasn’t too much that it became boring. I will definitely try another of her books. "
"3.5 stars for a decent plot and the police procedural aspects of the story, but Tana French has once again written an unpleasant, unlikeable protagonist who made it difficult for the reader to care about her and her incessant complaints about the treatment dealt to her by her male colleagues on the Dublin Murder Squad. Her persecution complex, while maybe justified, was tiresome. "
"Not as good as her previous books. Too much spent on the main character's self analyzing and doubts you lose the thread of the criminal plot. Or if her mind games are the central plot, you lose track of the other. 450 pages and I was tired of it by 300, and then only because I kept hoping it would get better based on the earlier books."
"Slow burning police procedural with an ""it's all about me"" lead D with a persecution complex (some validity as she is harassed) Lost a star for the language. Excellent interrogation scenes. Shame she totally dismissed her Dad as I'd have liked a bit more of his back story even if irrelevant to the murder case"
"Not my typical genre, so I don't know if this is always the case, but this was loaded with clichés. Tough female detective getting the shaft, but solves it in the end, yada yada. I don't think I'm particularly clever about mysteries either, and I had this one solved a quarter of the way through. Interesting story though, I didn't dislike it, but it really took a while to get through."
This book was very well written and carried a lot of interesting themes such as self delusion and paranoia. I admittedly found it a bit slow and the main character pushed my buttons sometimes because she is paranoid and also rather judgmental. I did really like her friendship with Steeve and appreciated the growth she showed by the end of the book. I also found the ending very satisfying. 
this detective room mystery is a Slow Burn if you're like me you'll get mad at the protagonist for just being so darn angry and uptight with everyone to the point where it's annoying to be in her head after about 20% of the book though it starts really becoming page-turner and the ending is very satisfying this is the sixth in a series I haven't read the other ones but I'll go back and catch up.
"The ending of this book was definitely better than the beginning. I really wasn’t a fan of Antoinette from the start. She was a complete jerk with a chip on her shoulder, treated everyone like they were the enemy, and would get mad when the rest of the ‘squad’ treated her like an outcast. I get it that they were horrible to get, "
"Enjoyed the progression of the protagonist’s character, but found it very slow. There was a lot of time wasted on rehashing the perceived hostility of the protagonist’s work environment. The premise requires a fair amount of willful suspension of disbelief to swallow. The ending does pay off, however."
"Not my favorite Tana French, I liked Moran all right, but I thought Conway was a bit too rough & tough. But it's always great to get back in the squad.
And what I appreciate is that it's really about the investigation and the dead ends, and not about the gory details of the murder & the vic.


And the ending with the gaffer is very classy. I loved it."
"I loved the first 4 books in this series, but the last two have been disappointing. I still like French's writing style, and I really liked the main character, Antoinette Conway. I thought the author did a good job with exploring the difficulties women in law enforcement face, but the plot itself just left me cold. Hopefully, her next book will be as good as her earlier ones. "
"A great police thriller. Perhaps a bit mor predictable than I would have thought, but surely compelling. There was psychological insight and character introspection. I enjoyed the reality check on police work. Language got to me, though I’m sure it was accurate for the setting. I guess I needed this genre for a minute. "
"Tana French is a wordy author. She has devised a clever plot, but it takes her 450 pages to get the solution, I think because she is so busy with an interior monologue detective Antoinette Conway carries on, comparing her youth and treatment in the police force to the life of the murder victim, as it unfolds. I wanted to quit, but couldn't. I like to know the end. "
"Essentially a police procedural with very little action. Almost all dialog and ""thought experiments"" about the suspects motivations. Very cerebral. I enjoyed seeing the protagonist's misperceptions and self-realizations.
Was confused by some of the Irish slang. E.g., gaff = house but gaffer = supervisor?
"
"I'm in love with Tana French's pen: I love the way she uses language, her descriptions ... a master storyteller at work.
Maybe it is because I'm reading this in a heatwave that's been on for weeks, but I find the book to be too long. Great lengths, character development ... I love it, but these lengths were too eh ... lenghty."
"I really only liked the second half of this book after Conway drops at least some of her pissy attitude and starts getting along with her partner, Moran. And the book dragged a bit with all the “he did it this way” and “what if” scenarios.
I could guess who did the deed before the characters got there. The only surprise was how the gaffer handled it."
"This is a chilly book, beyond the characters constantly putting on their coats. The lead detective knows her squad hates her and so she spends most of her narration hating them right back. The weather, the workplace dynamics, and a murder victim make for a menacing story, dumped down the collar of your coat. "
"I thought the characters were interesting, but the plot was a bit weak because I didn’t think anyone would actually plot to destroy someone’s life in this particular way. Also the book could have been much shorter. The suspect interviews I just skimmed with no loss of understanding. Lots of detailed, unnecessary fill in this book."
"Wonderful writing. Never stopped turning the pages, until one plot twist about 60% in that was way too convenient for a case of missing dad. Don't have time for a full review--and the spoilers that come with it. The book lost its pace for me after that. Will try another Tana French (In the Woods, probably) just based on the clever writing. Hope the plot is better. "
"Not as good as the last installment (""The Secret Place""--one of my favorites) but really well done and I liked the shift in character perspective from Moran to Conway and the different angle it gave their partnership.

I did see the ending coming but it took awhile and I didn't foresee exactly how it'd play out. All in all a decent mystery for a rainy weekend."
"Huh. This *was* shaping up to be my favourite narrator of the series, even though the case story is prolly the weakest of the lot and didn’t really draw me in - Antoinette was fantastic. About halfway through, the case picks up and she starts to unravel and my interest waned. Still a great wrap up but my heart wasn’t really in it."
I really like this author and this book was a good one but...the underlining premise behind the cause of the crime was a little thin. Makes sense I hope. I still recommend it but there will be some ‘really’ moments as you read it or at least there were for me. Still looking forward to Tana French’s next one!
"Okay mystery. Liked the role of the squad and internal stories but meh, I feel like I got the ghost of what she was trying to do/say about how our internal narratives color everything but it was at the disservice of a cooler mystery case. Like once she had the chat with the friend? After that was just a long referendum on ~thoughts~. Cool idea, just okay execution. "
I’m so torn on this one...I definitely want to read more by French because I did *mostly* enjoy the reading experience of this but...there’s something holding me back from rating it higher. I will say it was fun? Weird? Off putting? To read from the perspective of a character that would probably hate you in real life lol. 
"This is the second Tana French book that I've read and I was really hoping to like it more than I did. I struggled with liking the characters (except for the wonderful Irish accents), which made it hard for me to care for the story. The plot was interesting, although I felt it was much too drawn out. Overall, it was alright, but I'm not sure if I'll be picking up another Tana French book in the near future. "
"Phew! This was a long one! Had I read the book instead of listening on CD, I don't think I would have made it through. The narrators voice and slight changes for each character definitely kept me going when I would have otherwise given up. In the end it was a satisfying story but the long winded twists and turns were a bit much, could have been a tighter story. "
"I didn’t understand what I was getting into when I picked up #6 of a series. Needless to say, I have not read the first five in the series and I have no plan to either. I finished it with a sigh... finally done. I got the first clue way in the beginning and had to wait (in the interrogation room) for another 300 pages until the crime experts wrapped it up. Disappointing."
"This is the first work I’ve read by this author and it’s set in Dublin, which made it very interesting right off. The mystery itself was pretty good, but the protagonist was both very likeable and very unlikeable. She stumbled and flailed about and then suddenly everything came together at the end, which was fine, but not entirely satisfactory."
"Tana French uses a lot of words to get to the point, but I keep coming back for more...

Three stars seems like too many, but two stars isn't enough. In summary: Somebody did a bad thing. The detectives figured out who-dunnit (about time because I was able to figure it out five chapters ago). They confront the bad guy. The end.

And I was left wondering, ""And then what???"""
"I'm not sure if the length of this book was intentional to play out how they were dragging out the case or not, but it certainly did emphasize it. Interesting storyline, which led you through the brotherhood of blue loyalty and the conflict and consequences of both adhering to it and not adhering to it."
"First, I want to say that I love Tana French but this book just did not grab me. I'm not really sure why but it just seemed that it was slow. In the books defense, I was reading it in a bad state of mind. We were moving from one house to another and I was pretty exhausted.

Certainly doesn't discourage me from French; she is awesome."
"I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get behind it because I didn't like the main character. I really enjoyed the exposition and the description, but I need to like the people, too. Instead, I found myself increasingly frustrated throughout the book. I finished it because it was for a Book Club. Not sure I would have, otherwise. "
"I did like this book, though I am not sure I would have liked it quite as much had I not listened to the audio version. The narrator was very good, but the book seemed a little overly long to me. I guess I had a basic problem believing part of the premise and that made the big revelation hard to buy into."
"This book wasn’t as strong as the other books in the Dublin Murder Squad for me. A girl is found murdered and Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran work out what really happened to the girl. Detective Conway works hard against the chauvinism in her squad, police corruption and her own past to discover the fate of the murdered girl. "
"I read an early Tana French crime novel over 10 years ago for a book club and liked it very much. Normally mysteries are not my thing, not sure why, though this is a very good one. I enjoyed the Irish slang/dialogue and inner thoughts of the protagonist. I just find a lot of the events in most mysteries (this one not excepted) improbable and some of the scenes went on too long."
"If this book started 250 pages or so in, I would give it 4 stars. Why did Ms. French take so damn long to get going on this one? The last one I complained about character development, and while Conway has more of a voice here, nothing really happens in this investigation till like page 300! The last 150 pages are well done, but come on now. Funny thing is, I’m still planning to read the next."
"Unfortunately, I can't recommend the book because, in my opinion, the Irish way of speaking and the unfamiliar expressions did not make it enjoyable for me. I also found the story to drag on too much, especially the interviews of the suspects. But I realize others may have a different point of view."
"The story was decent but the characters were difficult to warm to at times. The female lead was complex, paranoid, and almost unlikeable in many ways. It is hard to believe that the anti-female detective incidents perpetuated by her male colleagues would be tolerated in a murder squad anywhere in the world. "
"I've read a lot of Tana French books and I think this was my least favorite to date. As always with French, the characters were really well fleshed out, but I found the plot to move extremely slow and more often that not found myself stuck in the inner monologue of the narrator and was bored. If you enjoy reading Tana French's writing in general, this is true to form, but not very exciting."
"I am a huge Tana French fan---but I was a not fan of this story. Very predictable and I knew what was happening in the middle of the book, just waiting for the ending. It is was an interesting side plot with the lead character's father that was not explored more which was disappointing. The writing, atmosphere was as great as usual but the story was not one of my favorites. "
"3.5 stars, probably in the lower/middle of my ranking of the books in this series. Still good but soooo sloooow and just not as engaging a mystery or main character as some of the others. The main detective was just so hard to get a read on and pretty unlikeable, which isn't a problem per se but she was so non-self-reflective that it was hard to get into her mindset at all."
This book will keep you guessing throughout the book. Ainslinn Murray is found murdered in her apartment. She has met a new love interest. Did he do it? Her friend says she had a secret lover. Who could that be? It is up to Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran to figure out this twisted mystery. You won't believe what's coming.
"Was a bit disappointed with this one. It offered a harsh inside view of the Dublin Murder Squad. Unfortunately there was very little to enjoy about the view and really only one truly likeable character--Steve. The victim was intriguing, but the mystery wasn't very puzzling despite the plentiful red herrings littered about.
However, the final few chapters packed a satisfying emotional punch."
"I really like Tana French's writing and this was a good story but there was so much swearing in it. I felt that was way over done. This was an audio book, so maybe that made it seem like there was more swearing than in her other books that I have read. The storyline was good and the lady who read the book did a good job."
I liked this one better than In the Woods but it may have been the age of the victim in In the Woods that made it a more difficult read for me to like. I do think there could be some editing as I am not sure much story would be lost in a 100 less pages. I was interested in the ending but it got tedious getting to it. 
"I listened to this on audiobook, and that might have influenced the lower score, because I have liked Tana's other books and had higher expectations for this. But it just wasn't that thrilling - I think I like my murder mysteries a little more grizzly than this -- otherwise, why bother, plus it helps keep alert on those long drives. I did very much enjoy listening to the accents!"
"I wonder why cops and everyone else (?) have such distain for mild mannered men, men who are not aggressive. In this book the police talk about their prime suspect as if he’s less than a man. He seems to me to be a kind, caring man. They all seem to want him to “man up”. I hate that shit.
The world is run by aggressive, power hungry men and look where we are. Ruining everything.
I got a kick out of all the Irish/British terms-gob, slangers, bollox, quigley, kip, lads, gaffers, gaff, etc."
"Finalmente acabei de ler este livro ! A história em si é boa, mas não eram necessárias 500 páginas para isto. Achei a leitura muito chata e cansativa, com capítulos muito longos. Demorei bastanta tempo a acabar o livro pois não conseguia ler mais de 10 páginas sem ficar aborrecida. Eu entendo que há pessoas que adoraram este livro, mas infelizmente não consegui apreciá-lo."
3 1/2. How was I to know that this was book 6 in a series? It was still really good. I was kept guessing until the end. A lot of history was missed due to being book 6 and I having not read the previous books. They were not required to enjoy this book. (read by an Irish reader). Mystery of a murder/death.
"Tana French and I seem to have a challenging relationship. I have read several of her books and I am constantly frustrated by her wild narrative tangents which are included in the guise of character development rather than red herring but, in truth, serve only as filler... you'd think she was paid by the page!"
"I didn't realize when I started reading this book that it was the sixth in a series, but it didn't matter. The story focuses on a female detective in the Dublin murder squad who hasn't yet had the opportunity to work on a 'good' case. In this situation, the murder of a young woman turns out to be much more complicated that originally thought. "
"Overall the story and writing was good, but it took too long to get to the end...there is a lot of fluff and excess that doesn't seem necessary. I also wasn't a huge fan of the main character, and was hoping for some reasoning for her behavior at the end but it never came, so I was left disappointed there. "
"Tana French is one of my all-time favorite authors, and while I have loved almost every single one of her novels, this one was just so-so, in my opinion. To much of it was spent really focused on the individual detective as opposed to the crime and solving it, and about halfway through it got kind of blah, then picked back up again near the end. "
"Can’t go far wrong with Tana French. Her books always start slow... but once they pick up I can never put them down! Like most of the others, this one had a very satisfactory ending. French does a great job of weaving themes and planting red herrings. Pure enjoyment!

Note: I always listen to her books on Audible because I love the Irish accents!"
"Couldn't really like the protagonist; felt like she kept flip-flopping from an unreliable narrator to someone truly persecuted. May have been the author's intent: part of the suspense of the story, but keeps you ""on the outside"" about her. Willing to go back and read the previous Murder Squad books (French really can write well!), but hoping I can care more about the protagonists in them."
"This is my first Tana French novel and I am looking forward to read some more of her work. The story isn’t as exciting as other murder mystery however, there was a nice flow to the story that made me find a time to finish the book. Unlike other books, it wasn’t a chore to read the whole thing. Rare books that doesn’t have to be overly dramatic to be interesting. "
"This is a book that the librarian recommended to me. It was solid, but a little slow in parts which is why I only gave it 3 stars. It was also a little too long. Finally started picking up at about 2/3 of the way though. I am glad I finished it. I would probably read another book by this author and also in this series if it's not as long. "
"Truly great one-liners that I wrote down. ""Not the brightest pixie in the forest."" being among the best. This main character survives their own inclination not to assume positive intent in combination with her crew, members of whom give them very good reason to follow that inclination. A survivor's story. "
"At the halfway point I was really hating this one, on the grounds that it required a lot more suspension of disbelief than I was willing to give. 
(""missingmymissingdaddy""?!) But I'm glad I stuck with it because the last half turns nuanced and deeply satisfying.

One fringe benefit is tons of Dublin slang."
"This would be a better story if the first half of the book didn’t try so hard to convince the reader that Antoinette was a bad ass detective. It���s almost like the character doesn’t believe it and has to keep convincing herself. Also, the f word could have been used less. All in all, a good story though."
I enjoyed this read - a little long. It’s a little uncomfortable to read a book with a brown woman as the main character when she’s written by a white woman. I felt it was a little put on and odd at times when it was brought up in the book. I felt a little disappointed in the ending or maybe just the way “coppers” politics work. 
"Too long, too detailed. I didn’t care for it. Lots of unanswered questions for me. Was she biracial? Was the man at the top of the road her father? The one Steve brings into house. Was he the trespasser? That was not clear. The interrogations were well done and seemed real. She wrote that well I thought. Not sure I’d read another. "
"It was ok. Parts of the book were suspenseful. But I really wasn't into all the emotional baggage that Conway carried with her. I preferred The Secret Place where the point of view was from Steve. With that said, the entire series was very well written. I loved getting into the heads of different detectives with each book. I hope there will be more books in the series."
"My 1st Tana French book & didn’t realize it was the 6th in a series til I was well into it.
Actually more if a 3.5 & probably a 4.0 if I’d read the others first! I was a little lost at one point but otherwise was able to follow easily.
Will be reading more of her for sure, great character development!"
"This was my first Tana French read and although the story was quite good I’d say the editing was quite bad. This was a 450 page story that should have been 300 pages. Also, the chapters were about 60 pages each…..way too long for my liking.
I’m wondering if this is typical for her books? Should I try another? Probably not for a while."
"Nearly finished,but so far I am sorry to say did not work for me, as any thriller-murder myster. Main character way too over the top hard ""arse"" Irish detective, made for distraction from already not-so-original storyline. I felt like I was reading a rewrite of the best cliches of so many tv detective shows."
"To be honest, I found it a little hard to sympathize with the main character, Detective Conway. A little of the writing felt contrived or cliche. Like ""the lady cop has to be offensive to be taken seriously."" By the end I didn't care whodunnit. I've really enjoyed reading these Dublin murder series books but this one didn't grip me as much as previous."
Overall a good story where justice is served. The relationship between the two young detectives develops as the case evolves and the author does a good job of conveying the atmosphere and character of the Murder Squad. I found the author’s style to be very detailed which I felt sometimes bogged down the progression of the plot. 
"Still one of my favourite book series, even if the last three were nowhere near as strong as the first three.

Trespasser falls somewhere in the middle for me. Wasn't overly keen on the narrator this time, but French's gripping plot and fast-paced, addictive dialogue kept me hooked until the very end."
"Don’t get me wrong the book was okay and there were some fascinating bits, but it has taken me two months to complete.

It’s not as entertaining as I thought and Conway was simply an irritating character, abrasive and too masculine for a woman.

The the rest of the cast were also pretty slimey in a narrative triumph.

All in all an okay 2.75⭐️ book."
"The problem with Tana French is she writes intelligently, but she goes on and on and on, and her lead characters are so unpleasant - and that is the cops, not the killers - that one starts getting irritated and impatient. Will this sentence ever end? Will Tana ever cut to the chase? Why is Antoinette such a nasty bitch? When oh when will this book come to a conclusion? Wah."
"Have to preface this by saying I am a big fan of Tana French but this book was not my favourite, quite possibly the weakest of her books I have read.

I guessed the ending as I found it was hinted at/revealed too early so the ending felt like a letdown.

Still very well written and I really enjoy the characters of Moran & Conway"
"Conway has to be one of my least favorite characters. I give this 3 stars because you spend so much time in her head. She is suspicious of everyone, has a giant chip on her shoulder and is unpleasant in most interactions. How could she even be a competent detective with that attitude front and center all the time?"
A good read but not my favorite Tana French. The narrator is pretty frustrating and irritating. The story isn't particularly surprising. But the way she unravels it and resolves it is nuanced and impressive as a study of human nature. There is too much time in the middle of the story where they aren't getting anywhere and I felt like it needed a little more plot.
The more books of French’s I read the less I like them.I’ve read-read books one through five and this author can’t ever finish an ending properly. I have read hundreds of murder mysteries (I’m 80 yrs old) she just doesn’t finish them to my liking. Especially the rip-off of book one. This one was too long.
"I was very disappointed with this book. I have enjoyed all Tana French's books, but this was very difficult to get through. There was so much conversation to follow, and it took forever for something to actually happen."
"I would say 3.5? Definitely enjoyed reading + liked Conway's perspective (anybody else envision her as the Rosa Diaz character from Brooklyn Nine-Nine? That's who I was seeing the whole time).

It's just hard to compete with The Likeness and The Secret Place.

"
"I liked this book just fine, but boy, was it over-long. 450 pages? Let's move it along a little! Having said that, I did appreciate how a twist towards the end forces our heroine to look back at what occurred and see it in an entirely new light (shades of Lymond in The Disorderly Knights).
"
"Good read. Great characters. The story didn't develop as much as I wanted it to between partners, and the ""dad"" showing up seemed gratutitous. There were also times when I felt like the author was trying too hard to be clever with the main character's ""feelings"". Would recommend."
"Very well written, but I just couldn't enjoy the lead detective. Tana French excels in conveying much by her descriptions of the atmosphere around the crime and this book was no exception in that regard. "
"Having thoroughly enjoyed both In the Woods and Broken Harbour, I was looking forward to this new Tana French book. I was rather disappointed, however, as I felt the story needed more editing. The characters were well drawn and engaging but it could have been around 100 pages shorter."
"2.5 starsBased on others' rave reviews, I'd like to give another book in this series a try one of these days. This one was pretty tedious for me. I did not particularly like Antoinette, the narrator, and the murder investigation just dragged on and on with way more telling than showing. Also, didn't anyone else find it completely implausible that McCann had no inkling that Aislynn was the daughter of the woman with whom he was obsessed a decade earlier? Pretty disappointed in this, based on its inclusion on so many ""best of 2016"" lists. Maybe mysteries just aren't my genre. "
"OK Read

Have read all of Tana French's novels and was eager to dive into this one. But it just wasn't the page-Turner that I expected. Plus I kept wanting to call the protagonist ""Toni"" rather than ""Antoinette"". Her name was too precious for her attitude."
"Good read.

I liked the story (see above synopsis), but it was a bit overlong. Too much complaining and paranoia on the part of D Conway, our heroine.

Overall, though, it kept me turning those pages."
It's good. If you're a fan of the series it's a must-read. Same plot twists - same plot resolution and then way more story than you expect. Some doors opened and just left ajar. Not as good as the rest but worthy of your time. 
"Definitely not the best of the series, but like visiting with an old friend...comfortable and satisfying.

Not as twisty-turny as previous, a little contrived, but a good start to beach read season, and worth keeping up with the series."
"A little too much in-the-head-narrative for my usual tastes, but well plotted, thought-provoking, with interesting characters. A plodding police procedural with well-appointed cultural and character details."
"I enjoyed this book more than the last one in this series by Tana French. At least the plot held up this time, but the main character has such a huge chip on her shoulder she is impossible to sympathize with. Good police procedural. "
"I was really hyped about this book, as I liked the previous books in the series a lot, especially Secret Place and Likeness, compered to these, this book wasn't as good, to get through the first half, or 2/3rd of the book was a bit of struggle, it got me interested the most at the end."
"Long. Coarse. No surprises or twists I didn't see coming. Probably a realistic Irish police procedural/murder investigation, but I found myself wondering why I stuck with it to the end. Meh. Liked The Likeness better.
"
"Not my favorite Tana French

A little too much detail and description for me. I think it could've used a little editing for excess wording. I get annoyed easily with unnecessary exposition!"
"I've read all the Dublin Murder Squad novels, and I like Tana French's writing. The strong points are good characters and an inside look at police procedure. This time, however, there was so much procedure that I wanted her to just get on with it and solve the murder!! "
I have enjoyed all of French's past books...this one just went on and on and on. Way too much this and that and the story almost gets lost in the distinction of the Murder squad. Hope the next one is more concise and less wandering. 
"I liked this book, but I felt it could have been half as long as it was. There was a lot of back and forth in the middle that didn't really feel like it was getting anywhere. I expected it to be a bit more suspenseful and the end became predictable and unsatisfying. aBut it was an enjoyable read!"
I read other peoples reviews and wanted to be blown away by this book but I just found it pretty average. There was no suspense and I wouldn't class it as a thriller. Just a pretty average book that in parts dragged.
"I love the Dublin Murder Squad series, but strongly disliked the main character's voice in this one. The plot was fascinating, but the style of the lead narrator/character made it a tough slog to get through."
"2017 Popsugar Ultimate Reading Challenge: A bestseller from 2016

Three and half stars. I adore Tana French; she has easily become one of my favorite mystery writers in the past year, and I have devoured every book in her Dublin Murder Squad series. That being said: there was something about this book that didn't quite work for me the way the other books in her series have. Let's dive in...

The Trespasser follows Detective Antionette Conway, whom we met in the previous book, and her partner Stephen Moran, who has appeared in several books, as they tackle what is supposed to be a slam-dunk domestic case. O'Kelly, the leader of the Dublin Murder Squad who we've seen in every book, teams them up with a third detective, a guy named Breslin, who right from the get-go pushes them to arrest the victim's new love interest who was supposed to meeting up with her the night of the murder. But Conway and Moran begin to suspect that there is more to the story than meets the eye. On paper, the plot of this book is rock solid, but in reality, it moved at a glacial pace. It took AGES for anything to happen, to the point where I felt like I had a pretty good idea what went down but Conway and Moran were still figuring it out. It's for this reason that it took me ages to finish the book; there is chapter after chapter of Conway and Moran just hitting roadblocks, which instead of ramping up the suspense just made me frustrated and tired of reading the book.

When all is said in done, the ending ties most of the strings up pretty nicely, and you get the answers you want, which is why I ultimately liked the book. French is very good at diving into the flaws of the detective she has narrating, and Conway is no different. Conway is bitchy and tough, but she is also insecure and even paranoid at times. Weirdly enough, I liked her better in The Secret Place; she was better in the third-person than as a narrator, and I can't really explain exactly why I have that opinion. I liked her relationship with Moran, but I felt French could have done more with it.

Bottom-Line: The Trespasser is a satisfactory addition to the Dublin Murder Squad series; the conclusion makes up for the times the plot seems to stall. All and all, I recommend to fans of the series."
"Well written detective story. Principal character is unique; a hard boiled, tough woman with an interesting back story, trying to figure out her place in the murder squad while also trying to solve the murder. Very convincing insider details of how things might work in such a setting."
Might be because of the audio- i thought it dragged on far longer than it had to and the accent was really hard to understand. Overall a great story line but some of the theories were far flung and dragged out. The twist was definitely the highlight of the book!
I haven't read any of the series and I decided to read this as the author had fantastic reviews. I do love a thriller but this kind of seemed slow to pick up and kind of predictable. I would like to say it is a good pick to read but it wouldn't be in my top ten. 
"I really felt that this book could have been half as long and you would still have gotten the gist of it. I have read the other books, I like the concept of revolving around a different pair of partners in the same squad for each book. This one dragged a bit. "
"I got bogged down in this one a bit. The story is solid, but there is a lot of slang, which may be authentic, but didn't work for me. On one page the word ""gaff"" had 3 different meanings!

I will read Tana French again - I think she's talented - but this is not my favourite of her library"
"Not my favorite. Took a long time to get there and then was not really impressed with the way it all played out.

Will continue to read her work because my first experience with this author was quite impressive and would not be opposed to trying another one of her novels."
"I wish we could give half stars; this would be 3.5. I liked the plot, and she creates great characters, but for some reason it was a real slog to read it. I finished barely in time for book club discussion. "
"This one didn't hold my interest as well as her other ones. I'd rather not say my problems with the book because it would give away the story, but there were too many things that frustrated me about it. I actually listened to this, which was fun to hear the accent!"
"This should've been an easy read for me but it just felt too drawn out and procedural. The storyline felt like an endless episode of Law & Order with no suspense or surprise ending. Somehow though, I really liked Antoinette and her cynical, witty commentary and tough exterior."
"If you like Donna Tart’s books or stories that have a long, slow build, this is a great pick for you.

I thought the story was clever and well written. I also appreciated the strong character development, but found this story too long and too slow."
Starts somewhat slowly but then becomes quite a page turner. It turns around the efforts are to try to push Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran to arrest the murdered girl's boyfriend. Was this another effort to force Antoinette off the Murder Squad or something else.
"Overall I liked this book. At times I felt that the main character was a little too whiny and at times it seemed that the plot was a little predictable. But in general, it was a pretty good who-done-it book."
"I love Tana French, but this just wasn’t my favorite. I wanted to be on Antionette’s side but instead I started to not trust her. And I felt like there was far too much conjecture going on during the case, that dragged for far too long. "
"3 1/2 stars - not 4 only because I got very tired of Conway whingeing about what she perceived as the Murder Squad's hatred of her. Fortunately by the end, she saw the light. I felt the book could have done with some editing, but the mystery was a good one."
"Everyone should read all of Tana French and for me the preferred order is in the order they came out. But here is how I would rank them:

1. The Likeness
2. Into the Woods
3. The Secret Place
4. The Trespasser
5. Faithful Place
6. Broken Harbor"
"This book could have been about 100 pages shorter. The narrator’s endless self pity is tiresome. The story itself is interesting, but it took me 3 loans from the library to finally finish it because most evenings I just wasn’t interested I reading more of her “ poor me”,"
"Good read, I think if I were to start again I'd read the series in order. I'm seeing people come in and out of the stories (I've read a couple from the series) where it would be good to place in chronological order.

Solid story."
"Police procedural/mysteries aren't really my thing. This was better than most, I'd say. Extra star for the audiobook version. I think I enjoyed listening to the Irish narrator as much- if not more- than the actual story."
"The only reason I have continued reading Tana French novels, is to find out what happened to the little boy from the first few chapters of novel #1!
Most of her books are boring, wordy, describe settings in too much detail, and end on a depressing note. What happened to the little boy, already?"
"I have read all of Tana French’s modern mysteries and I didn’t feel this one was one of her best. It seemed to drag for me and it was lacking in action. That being said, I will look forward to her next Murder Squad Mystery. "
"A good story, well written, with interesting characters. Many readers gave it four or five stars. I gave it three, as — even though the characters were interesting — I didn’t like them. It’s probably just not my type of mystery, although I may try Tana French again."
"I loved the narrator of this one. And I liked the story, but I feel like it was a little too long. Otherwise, it was really good, and I'm interested in possibly choosing another title by this author. "
"I found the ending of the book — the actual resolution of the mystery — must less interesting than the protagonists’ speculations of the mystery. Pretty disappointing in terms of plot, but I did love Antoinette as a MC. "
"Plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing, some more plausible than others. The highlights are two lengthy interviews with murder suspects. Tana French is a good writer but needs to tighten up her plotting technique. "
Another strong and detailed Dublin murder case with a male and female detective partnership. A lot of misleads in this one as well as a strong and complicated backstory for several main characters. Always enjoy this writer's work.
Love Tana French books. Had saved this for my holiday read. Wasn’t as keen as her others as disliked main detective & had the feeling (perhaps deliberately?)of being manipulated throughout by the author. Ending didn’t go the way I wanted but she is so good. 
"Not bad. The reason this is a 3-star instead of a 4 is mostly because I didn't like it as much as French's other books. I still enjoyed reading it, and the writing is pretty tight, but I'd probably recommend In the Woods or The Secret Place ahead of this one."
"This book was all ""What if"" dialog and very little of anything else. I probably read the whole thing twice with as many times as I had to start over a chapter because I got distracted so much. I was very bored.

No more Dublin Murder Squads for me."
2 1/2 stars. I’ve read three of Tana French’s books and this was my least favorite of the three. An unpopular women detective works on solving a murder. There is nothing exciting about the murder or the case. I thought this was a boring police/crime story. 
"I have liked the other books in the series much better. In this one, I felt every paragraph had a cliche, everyone hates her, Rory is so wimpy, Breslin was a character, Anslyn was so perfect, Steve is just a puppy dog - who also hates her etc etc Liked her other books better "
"Slow....slow...slow! I’ve rarely struggled to get through a book as much as I did this one. Too little plot, too much angst. But I did finish it because I HAD to find the good stuff. You knew it was there, but man oh man did you have to work to get it!!"
"This was a little draggy in the middle, but picked up about 3/4 of the way through and raced you to the end. The part about Conway’s father showing up was a bit ludicrous and felt like a lazy way of getting the conversation with Crowley done at the end. Decent read overall."
"Not substantial

book was good I wouldn’t recommend it. characters are not fully developed not lasting. Storyline not that engaging. Not enough going on to be engaging or interesting."
"I liked this book. I don't read a ton of mysteries, but this seemed to qualify as a good mystery, in that it wasn't horrifically gory and I did not know what would happen or where the plot was going. I was often frustrated at the constant focus on the main character's awful work environment (I felt this could have been conveyed effectively without mentioning it every other paragraph) but overall I enjoyed it, it was a fun absorbing read."
"The interviews and spilling, fountaining, spewing confessions get to be a bit much/unrealistic, but as always, French has such great pacing and delicious jerks of characters that you find you can suspend a lot of belief (and eye-rolling) and enjoy it anyway."
"The Dublin Murder Squad series is a deep dive into subcultures of Dublin area: a girls boarding school, the tenements, outsiders at the university, the hot shots who failed when the economy went south, and, of course, the cop squad. More an ethnography with a murder thrown in (sometimes more than one).
The series is a set of back story bios for the detectives. Some fail completely; some survive, but most are brain-injured during the investigation. Some detective partnerships blossom; some die hard.
French’s is able to put four or five characters in a room jabbering away and you know each one: no need for ‘he saids’ or ‘she saids.” French has her characters down pat. She keeps tension with dialog: conversations, interviews, and interrogations, not with action. You must like words and people to love her books.
Some think she should tighten her scenes. She writes ten-page, twenty-page dialogs. Be ready.
Finally, her plots are fanciful and often beyond plausibility, but I don’t care. I read for the people who live in the books, not for the plot.
Note I just finished all six books in the series and write a common review for all six."
"A murder mystery with a who dunnit kinda approach.
The dialogue is redundant and the characters are bland.
I wanted there to be more substance to this one.
The last 30 pages had a faster pace and more depth.
I actually liked the ending.
"
"Although this book had a good finish, the heroine detective Conway spent a great deal of time feeling paranoid about her place in squad. The murder is a complicated one that seems impossible to solve. The first book The Secret Place was much better
"
"Dublin Murder Squad series, book #6. Moran and Conway return in this one as partners at the Murder Squad. They're the rookies given the case of a domestic dispute gone terribly awry. The obvious suspect is the boyfriend, but Moran and Conway have their doubts. "
"This book could have been 100 pages shorter and I would have enjoyed it 100 times more. Great story, but lots and lots of details and exhausting detours. Not giving up on Tana French, but it will be a while before I try her again. Can't believe how long this one took me to finish."
"I don't know why exactly, but this one was just okay for me! It just didn't pull my strings the way some of Tana French's other thrillers have done. It's a perfectly serviceable thriller with some nice twists, very readable and tight, but It's just fine! "
Very descriptive writing that made this feel too slow. The drama felt real but also achingly frustrating in the slowness - despite the story taking place over only a few days. The title also seemed irrelevant and that irritated too. Probably not a series for me!
"This is the second Tana French novel I’ve tried and they are just not for me. I thought the book would never end and all of the slang words were beyond me. I know a lot of people love her books, I’m just not one of them."
"I found this book difficult to follow at times. Maybe it was the language of the unique practices of a murder detective. They think different. All in all it appears no one takes the fall for a beautiful, angry, conniving young woman."
"I actually only got about a third of the way through this. I know Tana French is supposed to be brilliant, but I just get worn down by the interminable internal monologue of her characters. Too Much Information. Not for me."
i was disappointed in this book. Two thirds of it was very slow moving and not a lot about the mystery. The last third of the book the story took off and became difficult to put down. I also had difficulty with some of the Irish terms for the police. 
"This book was good and heavily detailed. But, I felt like it dragged a bit, especially In the middle where the protagonist second guesses her every move, it frustrated me a lot. I started thinking should I trust her or not. But, the ending kind of made up for it. "
"For me the story was pretty good but overly long with a lot of unnecessary rambling. I understand the investigation is taking place in Ireland, but the use of slang was bothersome and lot of it just crossed a line IMO. "
I enjoyed the book but wasn't blown away by it. I was drawn in at the end but really lost interest in the middle. The last 40 pages flew. It may be a while before I read another Tana French because of the drag in the middle. 
"И ещё одна серия детектива зашла так же хорошо, как и предыдущие. В этом расследовании главную роль играет Антуанетта Конвей, ""белая ворона"" убойного отдела. Снова не обошлось без семейных историй, вплетённых в ход расследования."
I’m not really sure why I am giving this book 3 stars. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I guess it is because the ending offered some redemption. None of the characters were particularly likable. It dragged on and on and on when it didn’t need to. This is the type of story that would be good told in a 40 min podcast.
I don't know...I did not enjoy this one as much as the last one by any means... Page after page of speculation between the detectives until it finally comes together at the end. I did like the ending though.
"My god this book took forever to read. It needed to be at least 200 pages shorter, I swear. It was good, twisty, but too damn long and too many subplots. The ending was blasé at best and I definitely think I’ll skip on the others in the series. "
Interesting story but I always seem to feel that the books are too long by the end of each. Great police partnership here that felt real to me; where women and me can work closely together and not have it anything more than just work and friendship around that work. 
"Ultimately satisfying. However I am not a regular reader of police procedurals, and found the relentless dialogue between police, in Dublin slang ( with which I am not familiar) quite a slog at times. However, the character development is A plus, and made it worth the effort."
At the end it was disappointing- I found myself getting irritated by the constant reiteration of how tough and unlikable the main character was... and then when the murder was finally solved it was so unbelievable that it was a shame. 
"A very well written procedural. The author has a talent for writing real sounding conversations and the internal lives and thoughts of the lead makes this otherwise, more or less straightforward, mystery much more interesting. (this would be a fairly boring TV episode for instance)."
"3.5
Took me some time to get through this one. It was a little slow moving, but when it started to pick up the pace, I found myself wanting to read more and find out what happened. A pretty typical Dublin Murder Squad story."
I didn’t love this Tana French book. It was okay. I was disappointed by the mundanity of this straightforward “who did it” cop saga. It lacked all is the things that I loved in Tana’s other books- The Secret Place and Witch Elm. It was ehhh for me. 
"I've read all of the Dublin Murder Squad books, and this was by far my least favorite of the series. The protagonist was just so unlikable in her hostility toward everyone. I do think this was intentional, but it made it hard to read. I also didn't find this particular mystery very intriguing. "
I like Tana French but this book was my least favorite so far of hers. I felt like there was a lot of fluff and meaningless chat between the detectives. The story was good but not as good as the others.
"Those familiar with the Dublin Murder Squad series are aware there exists two stories, the murder mystery and the personal issue the lead protagonist struggles with. I very much enjoyed this murder mystery and felt the personal story was missing some clarity at the end. Overall, very good, though!"
"The good: set in Dublin, strong complex main female character, audio narration by Irish woman was good especially for characterisation of the arrogant Breslin with his posh accent.
The bad: overly long, especially some of the interrogation scenes, a bit too much detail"
"I never take two weeks to read a Tana French book, but this one was hard to get into. I didn’t like the characters nor the plot from the beginning to the middle of the book. I persevered and once I got to the second half of the book, the plot started to flow into a story that I cared about. "
First book I ever read on Kindle! Been a few years since I’ve read Tana French but this one seemed a little slower and kept me guessing a lil less than previous books in the Dublin Murder Series. Gonna read the newest one next though!
"The last two Tana books I didn’t just love. :( I found this one unbelievable and tedious at times. Still looking forward to reading her more, though. She still manages to make me get excited in ways other authors do not. Will read the new one very soon. "
"The first Tana French book I read was Into the Woods, which I enjoyed.
Reading The Trespasser, once I got over the protaganists anger , it was easier to read.

I love Ireland, so anything about Ireland that captures the lingo, slang, places of interest is fine by me."
"Another good Tana French novel that I should have read rather than listened to. The female Irish accentis not as appealing to me as the male version. I really liked the ending, but the story itself took too many winding roads to get there. 3 1/2 stars"
" I do really enjoy Tana French's writing; it is entertaining and easy to follow. But this book was 464 pages of mostly useless details. It didn't feel like much of a mystery, because I found the bad guy to be quite a stretch. The whole plot was a bit of a stretch. "
"Отличный психологический детектив, напряженный сюжет, инетерсные герои. Дико утомила нецензурная брань (ну ладно, они все-таки детективы, а не благородные девицы). И история с описанным шкафчиком- ну просто подростки в пубертате. К концу читать надоело уже."
"I am a huge fan of Tana French. However, this one disappointed me. It was way too long for the story it was telling and felt repetitive in spots. Also it was so ""talky."" So much dialogue that after a while it became tiresome listening to these characters bicker."
Really struggled to get through this book which tells me I didn’t love it. I found the author’s pattern of going into every little thought detail to be daunting. Well written but not a satisfying ending and the story could have been accomplished in half the words. 
"A good story with good character development. I thought the book was longer than it needed to be; part which can be attributed to Tana French's style of ""going down a rat hole"" from time to time on various scenes within the story. I'd read another book from Tana French. "
This book is well written but it is so focused on the workings of the police department that it almost distracts from the case. Maybe that’s appealing for others but I didn’t appreciate that aspect as much as I should to give it 4 stars. 
"I’ve always been a Tana French fan, but this one didn’t quite get there. There was a section in the middle that droned on endlessly that almost had me quitting. But then it got back to the story and ended better than I expected. Wanted to give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, but it just didn’t get there. "
"This was the first Tana French book I finished. I started one of her books (not a Murder Squad one) and couldn't get into it. Those one was better than that, but it was slow moving and didn't have a lot of action. I guess I was looking for more from this series."
"3.1 More long winded and winding than it had to be. Unnecessarily crude in ways that made the personalities seem fake or just over the top -like a basic stereotype vs a character with any depth. Story was ok, but nothing great "
"Too much talking

Everything is considered, hashed, rehashed and finally disregarded or accepted in dialogue, and the dialogue is as boring as hell. The book could use a good editor. About 1/3 could have been cut to make a better book."
"Conway is definitely the best Dublin Murder Squad character/narrator. The whodunit aspect of the novel was just fine, but her story/narration really makes it. Actress who did this audiobook absolutely slaps too. I could listen to just about anything in her midthirties alto Brogue. "
"I really wanted to like this story more—just dragged. Not a lot of action, and predominantly set in interview rooms which just felt stagnant. Even the eventual connection between the victim and lead detective was uninteresting."
Very long book with too much irrelevant detail and side stories. Interesting and compelling nearer to the end. It seemed to me that the author was trying to do too much with the lead female character. Not as enjoyable or readable as the Searcher.
A good 3 1/2 star mystery. The protagonist and her partner are murder detectives called in to solve a homicide. Amid a work environment filled with misogyny and elitism Detective Conway must fight to prove herself worthy. This was my first Tana French novel and I will read another.
"True rating - 3.5 stars

Loved the concept and the story that unfolded, but the pacing was a bit too slow for me and the main character/narrator's negativity throughout the story made it hard to get through"
"I felt this book could have been written in fewer pages and without quite so much whining. It was the first I had read in this series and perhaps I should have read some of the earlier ones before this one.
"
"I was so frustrated with the main character, Detective Conway, for most of the book and was glad Detective Moran was there for balance. I did like the mystery and the overall reveal and the pacing was great."
The crime story line was interesting to follow! The Murder Squad had so much toxic dialogue between each other that it was hard to read. I also found the main character unlikeable as she had no empathy for the victim.
"I'm a fan of TF but I've found this book weaker than the previous ones. 200 pp. less would have done a better job.
That said, still a good book, original in its being a series-not a series and in its plot.
The likeness still my favourite one."
"Another Murder squad mystery. Detective Antoinette Conway and partner Stephen Moran solve case of Woman killed - lover's quarrel apparent. Turns out it was another detective. Way too long, way too angst ridden."
The ending interrogation was very anti climactic.The mystery was very tame in this book and the actions of the victim seemed consulted to me.I also think that French couldn’t explore Conway the way she did MacKey.
"I would round this up to 3.5 stars. This took a long time to get moving, and the protagonist’s inner turmoil got tiresome. That said, I’ve read enough French to know that the endings pay off and this one did. "
"For most of this book I had a vague feeling of reading this before, but I couldn't remember how it ended so read to the end. My review is that this book is not interesting enough to remember, but entertaining enough to read twice."
"I really liked the first half of this book, the next part started to get a little boring, then the last quarter of the book was so ridiculously wordy (different people rehashing the same scenario). I had to skim to get to the end."
"Pretty good popcorn. First person narrative is always intriguing. Couple of loose ends, or maybe I just missed it: did Breslin bang her head again for fatal blow? Did Breslin actually play a larger role in her murder an McCann just not know? "
"

I am always drawn to Tana French -Her writing is superlative-and her stories unusually intriguing-
This one wore me out-Perhaps it was my mindset-I am not sure-
It seemed to go on and on-too much psycho babble and analysis-for this reader-"
"I think I have read enough Tana French. The basic plot was a good plot, but all the rest of it became just tiresome. At least I stayed with it to learn how it ends, but it was a close thing. Over 10 days to read this was just more than I feel it merited."
"Ok, this is the least likable female protagonist EVER! Wow. She was awful. At least this book wasn't as eeire as some of Tana's have been. Soul-staining, so to speak...However, this one did drag a bit. Let's just say, glad I am done. And, I still admire Tana very much."
"Normally I really enjoy Tana French's novels. However, this one really drug for me. I could not connect with the main character who was a snarky woman with a large chip on her shoulder. The plot took forever to really go anywhere. "
"3.5 stars

So... I definitely liked this book and I am not left as frustrated by its ending as I was with the first book of the series, Into the Woods (to which I gave a 4 star review). However, I did find the main character lead (Detective Antoniette Conway) particularly frustrating for most of the book. I totally get why she comes across as she is, and her paranoia is completely relevant to her being (un)able to solve the crime; but, like I said in other reviews, I tend to struggle when I cannot emphasise with the main character of a story or when I start to dislike them. I also felt that in this book there was a lot of attention given to the lead Detective's backstory, which I am not sure was the case for some of the others in the same series. I think this affected the speed of the plot.

Thankfully this story does not hinge completely on Antoniette Conway's frustrating character traits, so I did still enjoy most of it, especially when the tempo picked up more somewhere around the second half of the book."
"It's less murder mystery and more cop politics. The main character just keeps going on and on about how she's bullied at work and her coworkers suck and like, girl, I get it, but you have a murder to solve."
"The overall plot was great, but the middle dragged and dragged and there was a lot of whining and also a RANDOM subplot that went absolutely nowhere. If it had been tightened up, I've had enjoyed it a lot more."
Not as good as the other in this series. The plot is good but there are to many details. To be part of every longwinded interview with witnesses and suspects became boring after a time. The characters are believable and quite interesting.
"I usually enjoy Tana French's work though I often find it a bit overwritten. But, hey, that's her style.

This book however carried a premise of the dead girl that I couldn't buy and the whole mystery is written around that.

I didn't find it worth the time I put into it, sadly."
Good book. This book centers now in the internal politics of a detective squad and what it's like to work as a female detective in a male dominated industry. Strong characters and strong plot. More traditional crime novel story but still quite good.
"For me, this just went on a little too long. I didn’t really enjoy the book or feel suspends until the last 25%. Know that there needs to be a build, it was just a little long for my taste, and the numerous huge egos of characters in the book got a little tiresome. "
"The base of the story is good. But it's nearly 300 pages before you get there. Very slow moving. Too much inner monolog grom the main character, chapters full of redundancy. If you do trudge through it, good ending, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars."
"Way too slow for me. Tana French has always been able to draw me in quickly by her terrific ability to create characters, place and a plot that twists as it unravels. In this book, it seemed to be overly drawn out, too much conversation that went on and on. I struggled to stay with it."
"Very slow police procedural book. Lots of weird Irish slang that was distracting. I’ve loved the other books in this series, this one was still good but not my favorite. Ending felt kind of lackluster. "
"Skoro 500 stranek bylo na tento příběh proste moc. Nebylo to špatné, ale na konci to slo trochu proti logice. I kdyz bylo jasne ze jediný kdo ma motiv je pravy vrah, detektivove se nechali ukecat dalším detektivem, ze to tak proste neni. Konec mi přišel o.k. a jsem s nim spokojena."
"3.5/5 I really needed to end this series on a high note and I think I got my wish! It bothered me that majority of the book was theoretical but once we got through that, it really picked up speed and I really enjoyed. I’m kinda sad this series is over for me but happy to have read (most) of them!"
"For a thriller, it's pretty weak. We realise very early on who the ""culprit"" is, there's no plot twist to get us excited and, I confess, I hated the main character from the start. But it's a good read, a good book for a holiday."
"I'm only about a third of the way through the book. I'm getting a little bored with how the protagonist never trusts anybody to be doing or saying what they say they are doing or saying. For me, having her trust somebody sometime would give her mistrust a but more veracity when it's there."
"Far from French’s best, this one has some of the more tawdry writing and less interesting conclusion. Is everything technically sorted in a rational way? Yes. But it all feels a bit pat and procedural."
"3 1/2 stars. I do enjoy this series and characters. This one was a bit too long for me. More conversation between characters, less action. I listen to most of my books these days so if it seems to be rambling on, I get bored. "
"SLOW. SLOW. SLOW.SLOW.
Had to look online for a synopsis / spoiler - it said chapter 17 was pivotal. I went to that and read the rest - made sense after that . But OMG it was a slow, tedious mess to slog through."
The first half of this book was so hard for me to get in to. Reading rarely puts me to sleep but that's how The Trespasser was for me. It took me over a month to read the entire book. Then finally it started moving faster and I couldn't put it down. Tana French surely nailed the ending.
"Really 3.5. I felt this was overly long and sometimes complicated. The female lead was not a sympathetic character, but the overall impression of characters in the book was high. This is really a tome about how police procedures work (or don't) and how the officiers' thinking keeps changing with time. I loved The Searcher, but this one just left me a bit cold."
"in the vein of Tana French novels, this one is overly loquacious, making it difficult to get through the first 2/3rd of the book. The last 1/3rd reads much faster, as the plot falls together, though you still have to get over the rather awkward character developments. "
"this is the 3rd book by this author I've read, the best was the first, this is probably 2nd.. It takes awhile to get interesting, drags a little in the beginning, but ends really interesting. "
I didn't find this book as great as her previous ones. The female detective was trying too hard to be like one of the hardened guys.
I didn't like this one that much. It felt like it dragged on too long and the dead ends felt pointless instead of like a plot. 
"Takes too long to get to the point, unlike her other novels. But still--- it's tense and appealing and I recommend it."
"Pretty sure everyone figured out ""who done it"". And way too long. Good start, good ending but much too full of unnecessary repetitious gobshite in the middle. "
"Although I still liked so much about this book, it seemed to drag in parts compared to her other ooks."
"In the best light, the structure of the book mirrors Aislinn's and Antoinette's getting caught up in their own stories. I, however, didn't find this mystery terribly compelling."
I feel like I missed something everyone else got but I was not blown away by this. 
I usually love this author's work but I had to force myself to finish this one. A bit disappointing....
Way too long.
"3 1/2 stars. Antoinette Conway is on the Murder Squad in Dublin. She feels the men on the squad are trying to force her out. Meanwhile, a woman is found murdered in her own home, next to her table set for a romantic dinner. The boyfriend becomes a suspect, but Conway thinks there is more to the murder. Like all French’s Murder Squad stories, it is good; but this one tends to ramble a bit too much. "
"Being a murder detective is nothing like Antoinette Conway thought it would be. She is on the outs with all the men - constantly tormenting and pranking her...not nice pranks either. She picks up another domestic violence case at the end of a shift with her partner Steve. Seems pretty cut and dried, but then pressure from other detectives makes her think twice about what is really going on. Enjoyed the plot. Lots of characters running fantasy storylines in their heads. Probably would have given it 4 stars but the language was bad - lots of ick to wade through."
"Tana seemed off her game with this novel. Lacking in suspense, too much recap from one chapter to the next. Whiny lead character... Disappointed overall,but still an easy read. Hopefully she will be back with more novels that capture the excitement of her earlier works. "
"Good book with great incite into the mind of a detective. Fun slang and jargon of the job and location. Could have been 50-100 pages shorter, sometimes I found it a bit long winded. "
I enjoyed the book a lot but I saw the twist coming a mile off. I prefer mysteries when I feel silly for missing stuff like In The Woods. 
"Eh. I didn't love it. It took way too long to get to the point and when it did, it was anti-climactic."
3.5
"I love Tana French, but this is her weakest book. Straight up murder mystery without her usual atmospheric other-worldly sense of place. Predictable ending. Sorry Tana!"
"Really enjoy this author. I did find this one to be slow paced compared to her previous books, but the police procedural and all the twist and turns made it a page turner."
"Definitely not my favorite in this series,but still worth reading. "
"This was pretty good. I was annoyed at times with the main character, but I obviously didn't put the book down! Interesting play between cop partners past and present. Had me guessing until the end. "
Little slower going than her other novels.
3.67
"A little slow to get started. Once it did, I liked her novel as usual."
"It was okay, not great. I wasn't dying to know what happened and I kept falling asleep reading it. "
Best one.
Too slow. I liked the last 150 pages (but the book is 400+)
Slow going but good! I may actually read the rest of the series. French even makes you feel bad for the killer--now that takes skill.
First Tana French novel and of course I start with the latest book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Can be read as a standalone with little to no confusion.
I was very disappointed in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the previous books in this series but this one didn't grip me.
"My least favorite Tana French novel, it seemed flat and predictable and dragged at times. "
A bit long but in the end was happy ....
"Love Tana French, but I found this book so incredibly slow. Still great dialogue and theme, but I had to push myself to finish. "
"First half of the book sounds like crazy story in one cop's head, then it gets good and end surprisedly well."
"3.5/5

Took me a lot longer to get into this one than the others -- Antoinette's hatred of everything and cynicism were difficult to take. Last third of the book was captivating."
"Not quite as good as the other Dublin Murder Squad books. Not sure Antoinette Conway was given the best treatment, although it was nice to have a female protagonist."
Good story-line with unpredictable conclusion but Antoinette's paranoia around the squad room got tiresome.
Usually I am a big fan of Tana but this story fell a bit short for me and I didn't love the narrator/main detective 
"Popsugar Challenge: A book with a red spine

I loved the author's prose but the mystery was just so-so and the book could have been 150 pages shorter."
"Another great story from Tana French. This one got a little long winded at times. But still, entertaining, credible and great characters."
Really closer to 3.5. I liked the story but didn't feel you need 451 pages to tell it. 
3.5 stars
"It was interesting, it kept me reading. However, it was not a page turner for me. Good, not great. The fool language turned me off."
"Page-turning, lightly suspenseful, interesting characters. Would re-visit this author and her other work to see how she treats other plotlines/character development. "
"I didn't like this one as much as the others. It felt ""slow"" and the characters were more shallow, less developed and like able the in the previous books."
Not my favorite of the series. But still can't wait for more.
 A gripping mystery and portrait of police in Ireland
Pretty good! It was sortof an Occam's Razor ending but in a satisfying way.
Hard to get into.
Summer page turner.
"The main character is thoroughly unlikable, but I still enjoyed the book. "
Took me a few days to get through and I didn't warm to any of the characters.
"Enjoyed listening to the audio version during our summer road trip. This novel not as good as some of French's other books, but still worth a read (or listen)."
Not my favorite Tana French.
Still good but less favorite than her others. 
"Was a bit long winded, nearly gave up a few times. But had to find out whodunit!!"
good...not what I usually read but enjoyed
This just didn't hold my attention as much as French's other mysteries. The plot dragged in the middle and felt more convoluted than her other books.
"I found the trespasser as a metaphor interesting, but the characters unlikeable."
"Very predictable and the lead character complaints became the story. Not my favorite of the series.

"
"This was tedious with dialogue and not as suspenseful as I wanted it to be. However, I listened on audio and it was 16 hours of Irish brogues, so I didn't mind at all. "
Not my favorite book of hers. 
Not as good as her others.
This book is a very good mystery/thriller. 
My least favorite of hers :(
"This one wasn't as good as her earlier ones but still a page turner. Readers who have an issue with crude language, beware. You probably wouldn't like Tana French."
Interesting to see human behavior through the eyes of a (fictional) cop.
Ok. Found myself losing interest at times.
"Enjoyed the story - although it seemed repetitive. Did not really care for writing style.
"
Least favorite of the series. 
listened to this via Audible. I liked the Irish accents.
It was a good detective/crime book.
The story ended up being good but the beginning took tooooo long. I'm not sure I'll read another by this author - way too much dross to was thru. 
"Far from my favorite Tana French, but I can't deny that even at her weakest she's a phenomenal writer."
A bit too much but not A bad read. 
"Pretty standard French, didn't think so much of the plot, and despite good main characters, Conway was a little better as the non-narrator."
Usually really like this author. This book was way to long for the story. I was listening on CD and it took 12 CD's to get to the real killer. The whole book should have been 12 CD's. 
I liked the added element of the crappy office culture and harassment adding to the protagonist's sense of paranoia.
The novel was longer than it needed to be and filled with angst from the protagonist. It picked up in the last 100 pages but I didn't find any great resolution at the end. 
I had this mystery figured out early on and it was very long winded getting to the end but still a pretty good read.
An interesting story with a female detective who thinks outside the box.
"I think she is a great writer of great mysteries. Wonderful characters, plots, so why only three stars. She waste words! She could trim her stories and make them much more enjoyable and readable."
"Interesting concept, execution is a bit lacking, perhaps due to a few unlikeable characters. Still, a page turner as always."
"A bit drawn out at times, but overall I enjoyed the characters and storyline. "
"Would give it 2.5 stars though I've liked some other of her detective novels (In The Woods, Faithful Place). This one dragged on & I lost interest in the audiobook at half-way mark. DNF."
"I would have put this book down, but I had to know who murdered Ali. It goes on and on and on. When I think I have solved it, it still goes on and on and on. Wouldn’t recommend this one. "
I enjoyed this audio book - best part was the Irish narrator - it was like having Dee Lake in the car reading to me!😊
"This is my first Tana French novel. Good plot development, a gritty view of Dublin murder squad but 100 pages too long. Not sure if all her books are like this."
Not up to Tana French's usual standard. A police procedural that drags.
Audiobook- hard to understand some of it with the accent and the slang. A few loose ends- it was okay. 
This was a really long book. Interesting and I enjoyed listening to it but not really my cup of tea. 
3.5? Wasn't exciting enough for how long it was.
"3.5 stars, enjoyed the plot but definitely the least enjoyable protagonist of the entire series. "
"This was my least favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books.
The main character does whine an awful lot.
The story was good but the depth of persecution complex by Conway got rather old."
Maybe my favourite murder squad novel??
"This book was okay, but it really took me a long time to get through. I did not find it as interesting as I have found the other murder squad books, but Tana is still my fav. "
"The plot itself was very good....it was about 200 pages too long. The first half was hard to get through, but when the pace picked up, so did my interest. "
"Another solid Tana French novel, not quite as compelling as some of her previous entries"
"Entertaining.
"
It was ok. Lots of buildup to a rather low key ending. Maybe I need to read more action packed spy thrillers. 
"Meh

Even though the book starts off with the crime, it took me FOREVER to get into it. Once i was able to, it wasn’t bad."
good story but lacking the punch and momentum of her other novels.
"I usually love Tana French. And I do love the Conway/Moran pairing, but this one felt like a slog. "
Her er min omtale av Inntrengeren. Linken fører til min bokblogg. https://mineboker.wordpress.com/2018/...
I adore Tana French but this was the least interesting of all her books. 
"Although the mystery was interesting and kept me reading, the main character of this book (Antoinette) is fairly unlikeable. This made it a less enjoyable read."
It had some interesting twists but overall it didn't capture me.
"Not normally a reader of detective books, but this one held my interest."
"I loved all her previous books. This one was just okay.
"
"While it was a good read, for me, it was about 200 pages too long"
"Love French’s writing & characters

Love French’s writing & characters... and the mystery always leaves me wondering until the end. Not my favorite but a good, solid read."
"Everyone’s a victim - and those who ‘trespass’ will regret it.
"
"A little long stretched out story for my taste, but still had to finish to find out what really happened , "
"Wonderful, dark story but painfully slow."
"Not as good as some of the others, but interesting."
Not the best Murder Squad novel but interesting. Knew the killer early on but didn't see the ending coming
"Good but long ... difficult narration style at times. Heroine spends the entire book being paranoid about other police officers in her squad picking on her. Got a bit old.
"
"Pretty good-3.5 stars. A bit too much talking and not enough action, but it held my interest."
Took awhile to get rolling....
"It took a long time to get into this book, but it paid off in the end. Great twists."
"I really liked the story and the mystery, but only gave it a 3 because there was so much foul language. I know that makes it more realistic, but I don't feel it is necessary, and don't enjoy it."
"Decent read, always like mysteries."
"Cleverly crafted murder mystery; once you get past a lot of Irish slang-jargon, this is a fun and fast read."
I preferred the earlier books in this series. This got so dull that it took weeks to finish. 
"This was a riveting murder mystery. I just had quite a hard time with the over-the-top profanity. It felt authentic to the characters, but it was too much for me."
"I definitely got sucked in, but there was so much navel gazing that I found myself hoping someone else would die. "
2.5
"Really 3.5 stars; not my favorite one of hers, but will continue to read all her books; if you haven't read her yet, you're missing out!

"
Good ending but I struggled getting to it. 
"I really liked the first three books, but I thought this was way too long. She is a good writer and I liked the characters, but I thought she took it too far.
"
"Murder mystery. Pretty good. Not my usual read.
"
"Audiobook. Enjoyed the Irish back drop, and an easy listen. "
"Had a hard time getting into this book. Got better near the end of the book. I usually love Tana French stories, not so much with this one."
"Another well-written book. Conway is abrasive and not easily liked, but that's by design, and doesn't stop you rooting for her and getting caught up in the story."
An interesting narrator and a compelling story but could be tighter
This is a loooong book that could have shaved off 150 pages without losing the plot. It took me halfway through the book before I was really interested.
"A strong female character with a chip on her shoulder. The mystery was exciting in parts, but not a nail bitter. "
"It was decent, but it dragged at points. It takes awhile for the plot to pick up."
3.5 stars!
"Definitely wasn't my favorite, but still found it enjoyable because French is still a great writer. I found myself not really caring who actually did it towards the end. "
"Generally an enjoyable read and enough twists and turns to hold my interest. Got bogged down
at times with lengthy descriptions of the protagonist's emotional state - but I may have missed the point. When I want to know what happened, I get impatient. So I was a three, leaning to a four."
"Not the finest Tana French book I've ever read (the protagonist isn't as likeable as some of her others, the crime isn't as interesting to me) but it's still Tana French and it's still good."
went on a bit too long after the first half of book. 
3.5 stars - my least favorite of this series. Just not as interesting and the main character isn’t likable.
"Good plot, but the book was long and dragged on in parts. "
Total snooze fest for the first 2/3. I was kind of just reading to get through it. But I did enjoy the last 100 pages or so!
"CD road trip. Token police procedural, token this and token that and token t'other, narrator Dublin down with her Irish up."
eh.... Antoinette kind of annoyed me. 
The main character was great but the book got a bit slow in the middle. 
"A great page turner and clever plot but the “main cop“ is so hard boiled, she’s difficult to believe. "
"I’m not a big fan of detective stories. This one held my interest well enough, though it was a bit dragged out for me. It was ok, not great. "
3.5 Took a while to get into it - got better in the end.
Not my favorite of her books but has the classic Tana twist. 
I had a very hard time getting into this book. It picked up about 2/3 of the way in but I nearly put it down. I only stuck with it because it’s so highly rated. Wouldn’t really recommend. 
"I liked the story a lot, but would have liked it better if Antoinette wasn't such a negative character."
"I can’t decide if it was a page turner or if it was too long, but entertaining. Is there such thing as a cumbersome page turner??? I’m not sure. Could have taken out some fluff and made it 350 pages "
"3 1/2 stars. A little slow getting into the book- long chapters, took awhile creating the characters. Liked the last 1/4 of the book the most."
"I spent the whole book wondering when the twist was coming, when it wasn't going to be so blindingly obvious what was going on. That moment never came."
This spinoff story was a little too much of a downer for me. And the story didn’t offset the negative for me.
"Hmm. This was less gory than the others, which is good for me, but my least favorite due to slower pacing and a convoluted plot."
"Too slow

Pretty good but slow. Could have had more pace, took me ages to read. I really wanted to enjoy but I didnt. Giving 3 for storyline which is pretty good"
This one dragged for me. Also I did not appreciate all the anger that the main character felt. It got to me.
This book dragged on. A lot.
"If you like murder mysteries it is very good. However, some of the characters are not so likeable. For example, the main character. She is way too negative for my taste. "
"3.5 Stars, a good murder mystery who done it, Dublin style! Entertaining for sure. I think I loved the words they used in conversation the most! "
I found this to be well written but super slow 
"I love Tana French, but this one didn't really do it for me."
"Unpleasant people, interesting mystery."
Interesting story but felt very unrealistic though I liked the characters 
"Pretty good police procedural, could have used a more vigorous editor. "
This book was about 5 chapters too long. There was a fantastic build up and then obstacle upon obstacle to get to a resolution. 
"This book was way too long and the main character was pretty insufferable for most of the time. To the author's credit, the main character finally got called out and the mystery was well done. "
"I listened to this book and the accent was sometimes hard to understand. Otherwise, it was a good book from a good author."
Just ok. A bit longer than I think it needed to be. Maybe I just don’t appreciate the characters. The audio was pretty good though. 
"Several elements just didn’t ring true but French is such a great storyteller that I was not put off by them. If you like crime fiction, this works wonderfully. "
The story moved too slowly for me. The writing was good but I only truly enjoyed the last chapter of this book. 
"Intriguing plot; didn't like the female detective character - too abrasive, always angry."
"Decent plot and characterization, but SO much longer than it needed to be. "
I’m not usually into cop books but this one was good
"I would have given a higher score, but the huge number of sentences beginning with ""Me and Steve..."" was like fingernails scratching a chalkboard. "
3.5 🌟
Solid but didn't grab me.
"First half was pretty slow, but I still liked this a lot."
"3.5 stars
3.5 stars"
"This one took awhile to get going, but I really enjoyed the 2nd half."
"Typical Tana French. Interesting story, but it drags on too long. Pretty good “late night on vacation “ read. "
"Pretty good, too long. Better than the last one I read, since I knew what to expect now. "
"En fängslande, välskriven deckare - men ibland känns slutsatserna lite orimliga och dialogerna en aning för utdragna. Läsvärd. "
Meh. It’s a pleasant undemanding read. 
Extremely repetitive and annoying. Could not wait to be done. 
"An easy page turner but it probably couldve been 100 pages shorter. It droned on about the same thing over and over, with a lot of build up for an obvious ending."
Slow going. Unlikeable protagonist. Lots of Irish idioms that had to be figured out. Compelling dialog and interrogations. But kind of meh for me. 
"3.5: decent plot and characters, but a tad drawn out 😕"
More like a 3.5. Good story. Interesting enough characters. But I feel like it could have been at least 30% shorter without losing anything important.
"I guessed the ending to this about 3 chapters in, but to be honest it didn’t particularly spoil it for me. Well written police procedural with flawed, interesting characters."
Just ok
Good story but it’s about 200 pages too long. Really started to drag in the middle. 
"Not a bad story, but too long to be a satisfying mystery."
"long complex police novel, a 3.7."
My least favourite of the series - but still very good and absorbing. 
I normally love this author but this book was just ok to me. Still well done but the story didn’t capture my attention like she usually does. 
"Long but exciting at the end

First three quarters need to be more condensed, but the ending was riveting! Guess I'm not into murder mysteries, but might have to start."
"I listened to this one, all 19 hours, with the thick Irish accents. Kind of a non-story. Could've been a short story in my book!"
"3.5. Better than The Secret Place, but with less depth than the others."
"I thought this was very long and drawn out, I personally think she could have made it half as long and twice as interesting.
Read to the end though, had to find out what happened to the murderer."
"Good read, slightly obvious ending, but still entertaining. "
This was my first Tana French that I didn’t love. The main character’s persona storyline seemed to get in the way of the novel. 
Normally like her books but I found the main character annoying. Would give 3.5 if I could because the plot is good. 
There’s just too much of this book. I skimmed the last 50 pages to see what happened. 
"Long winded, annoying protagonist with an exhausting chip on her soldier, implausible storyline"
My first one by this author. Not a bad story--a bit wordy. Good mystery.
probably more of a 3.5. i really enjoyed this one.
"Too slow moving! Cop talk , very crude!"
This was my least favorite of hers so far. I think I’m quitting this author anyway due to ridiculous amounts of foul language. 
"I enjoyed this. For me it rates a 3.5 because it's not my favorite Tana French novel, but I liked it well enough to continue reading her other books."
Really a 3.5 - it's been a long time since I read a police mystery and this one was a great return.
"The book had a interesting plot, but was too long and drawn out - I kept waiting for the ending. "
"Jaysis, Antoinette, could you be more paranoid?"
"Очень крепкий детектив. Прочитала с удовольствием, но без замирания дыхания"
Hard to enjoy a book with such a thoroughly unlikeable narrator. 
"My least favorite of her works. I loved everything about the detective and his story, but nothing about the crime itself. Maybe I can come and revisit this with time. "
Good mystery but too wordy.
"Been on a Tana French binge since June...this was my least favorite of the four I've read, but I still liked it..."
"Great story line, but I found the writing style disappointing. "
"Long, long first half during which events ramp up very slowly. The workplace drama and second-guessing got old fast, but it’s a good story with solid, if not always like-able, characters. "
Female protagonist not very likable - plus detective story. Not my favorite type of read.
Boring first 2/3.. the last 1/3 was exciting. Slow drawn out like a real detective trying to piece together to find the truth. 
"It was a slog, a trudge through well-written prose. I didn’t get to know the main character. People were too much in their heads. Loved most of her books"
"Dear god, I did not like this character, and the book went on forever, and how much they made her unlikable was not redeemed by the ending. "
"Liked the mystery, liked the drama, did not like that our main character turned out to be a hysterical woman who cant take a joke. "
"Förstod rätt tidigt vem som var den skyldige, efter det tappade boken lite."
Good story. Only gave it3* because it was just tooooo long!
"Very well-written mystery/drama, but a little too lengthy and too much detail for me. "
2'5
"3.7/5
RTC"
http://www.cargadaconlibros.com/mini-...
Figured it out pretty quickly. Left me with 600 plus pages of excruciating detail of unimportant stuff. Book could have told the same story ALOT shorter. I’m so glad it’s done. 
I am not a reader of mysteries but I enjoyed this. 3.5 at least. 
"The premise and first half of this book were compelling but then it just dragged on till the end. The weakest book in this series, to my mind."
"Interesting mystery but may have been too convoluted for it’s own good. Also, the characters are quite annoying which made it frustrating to read. Otherwise, it was okay. "
I just don't think I'm a Tana French fan. I don't get it. Longer review to come.
Very good!
3.5 Stars
"Good story line

This book took a while to get moving. Almost too much detail in the beginning but once you are pulled into the story you can’t put it down"
My first Dublin murder squad book. Likely my last. That is all.
(3.75)
"Great story, but about 1/3 of it could have been edited out to make it less frustrating to read. So much description and such a snarky main character. Not an easy read, but I had to know the ending. "
Listened to the audiobook. Engaging crime detective book.
"Probably like 3.5. It wasn’t bad, just didn’t really draw me in. "
"Чрезвычайно уныло, надо сказать. "
3.5 stars. Came in on the middle of a series. Irish female detective filled with doubt. Might give French another go. 
Listened to the audiobook.
"Ok story, very long winded in parts, could easily have been much shorter"
3.5.
Somewhat too wordy. There was a whole section midway through that could have just been chopped. I struggled with the slang. 
A simple yet long story. 
Good cop story. 3 1/2 stars. Sometimes too descriptive in unimportant details but entertaining.
"Of all the Tana French books in this series this was my least favorite only because it took so long to get into it, however the mystery was still great as usual!"
This was a very good story and I would have given it a higher rating if only the editors had done their job . It was just too long!
Whodunit based in Dublin.
"It's fine. The beginning and middle were really ramping the story up, but I felt the ending sort of just tapered off. "
"I wasn't that thrilled with the story. Too much time spent in the ""interview room"" and it just dragged. The idea behind it was good, the execution of it was just tedious for me."
I didn't care for this one as much. I guess I didn't really like the main characters or the story much. I still enjoy her writing though and will read more.
"Audiobooked--great format for the great dialogue that drives the book, including long interviews. "
I found the story took awhile to pick up speed. It wasn’t as good as the other books in the series. I found the last few chapters were the best in the book. 
Okay 
"Entertaining, suspense, kept me wanting happy ending, rate 3.6"
6th and final book in the series. Not my favorite characters but the plot line was interesting and I enjoyed it. 
"Giving Ms French another chance, this Book #6 of The Dublin Murders was pretty good. Good enough for me to read #7."
"3,5⭐"
"I liked this one, just not as much as some of her other books. "
Slow developing but the last 100 pages made it worth the wait. 3.5 would be the right rating
I had a hard time getting through this one. I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. This one felt very long and drawn out. The story itself was good though.
I really enjoy Tana French's crime fiction. Good stuff. 3.5*
"The last 100 pages make me round up to a 3.5, but the main character wasn’t as interesting, and the plot wasn’t as elegantly connected as the early DMS books. "
"Great plot but very, very long. The length doesn’t further the plot- which at its core is a great story, but she needed to edit a 3rd of it out."
Ко второй книге я начала уже уставать от бесконечной рефлексии героини. Ну и несколько затянуто для детектива. 
"3.5. Too long and too much detail for me, but a good murder mystery!"
"Another highly rated thriller writer with a unique story telling style, French keeps readers on the edge of their seats in this investigation."
excellent mystery - so much better than her last one
"I really wanted to like this, because I love Tana French so much. Alas, I just did not like the main Detective Antoinette. "
This was my first novel by this author and likely my last. I am searching for a new author after finishing Karin Slaughters series and this wasn’t it. It was okay. 
"I'm all for details, but man this book was longer then It needed to be!"
I did like the characters and the whole Irish vibe but it could have been shorter
"Какая-то я не целевая аудитория этого автора. Пару раз бралась за Тану Френч после хвалебных отзывов, но увы. Мне было очень скучно, и героям симпатизировать не вышло. "
"This one was the least mysterious, no super natural stuff. Just straight forward who-done-it."
Took me awhile to read this. Was okay. Too drawn out.
"This was quite a frustrating read, and could have concluded sooner. Too much of the story reflected on the anger of the narrator."
"3.5
Such a looong book. I almost wanted to stop reading it because it moved so S L O W. I really started liking it about half way in and I enjoyed the ending."
"Started a little slow, but satisfying overall. Read as a standalone (and I didn't feel like I missed anything by not reading the previous installments)."
"The ending was very good, but getting to it was a little too wordy."
HUGE!! BIG! ENORMOUS! chip on this detective's shoulder. 
A few decent twists in the case for a prickly detective. She really doesn’t know who’s with her and who’s against her. 
"I really didn’t like the lead character from this book, but the crime mystery was well told. "
Expected a little more from this book after reading the first one. I had a feeling that the story was losing a lot on its content and have some plot holes
I find I need to like the protagonist of novels I read. And I don’t like this protagonist. 
"Too much talk

Good plot. Too long and too much dialogue didn’t do it any service. The center of the story could be ripped out and no one would miss it."
Hard to know what to rate. 3 or 4 stars. It started out really slow and I almost quit a few times but at some point after the half way point it got better. I ended up enjoying it!
Decent procedural mystery for the first two-thirds.
"I liked this book but it was probably my least favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad series, "
"Never ending

I somewhat enjoyed the book, but the ending took a long time to happen. I do like Tana French, though."
Not here best but always satisfying. 
"I love Tara French. But for some reason, this one dragged a little. Kinda felt like she wanted it to be longer, so she added words. Good mystery. Just not her best. "
"I enjoyed ""The Secret Place"" so very much that I think I was always going to be a bit let down by the next installment, but I was underwhelmed by this one. More thoughts later..."
Listened to the audiobook. Not my favorite by her but still a good mystery. 
"Pretty procedural, but nothing wrong with that sometimes"
3.75 ⭐️
"ehhh... like good, not that interesting, the librarian hyped it up too much."
My least favorite of her books so far. Progress on the case took too long - well into the second half of the book.
Very cleverly written- gives you an idea what a day may look like for a female detective. The different theories that they may come up with to solve a murder.
The first book in this series was really good and I looked forward to this one. However it was so hard to read and drug on and the on. I couldn’t wait for it to be over. 
An engaging police procedural; part of the Dublin Murder Squad series.
This one felt all over the place. It reminded me of an Agatha Christie book. No way to solve it until the end. Not my favorite in this series.
3.5*
Solid read. Dig the Conway/Moran matchup. 
Takes you deep inside the squad room. Compelling plot. Crude language.
not as good as The Searcher but still love listening to these accents!!!
"The perfect final paragraph to finish off an amazing series. ILY Tana, you’re a literary genius *mwah* "
"3.5, rounded down "
"lots to like, but a few too many inconsistencies to rate higher. French does a great job of drawing drama and tension from a relatively small case, and there were lots of legit twists and turns."
My belief was suspended but apparently not enough that I couldn’t get over that suspects did not immediately call their lawyers 
"3.75
"
"I really wanted to like this one. I usually love police procedure books, but this one just wasn’t it. "
"Meh, Not my favorite Tana French. 🤷‍♀️"
This one is classic Tana French all the way except for the ending wrapped up pretty nice and neat and actually don't have any alternative theories for once.
(3) — interesting but solved case was mildly underwhelming as it was very gradual
"The slowest burner of French's books, not necessarily to its benefit. But it's still French."
"I like Tana French a lot, but I thought this book needed some strong editing. Not my favorite."
A good mystery but too coarse and rough for me. I kept reading to find out 'who done it' but I grimaced a lot along the way.
Steve. Steve is the man. That's all.
"good read

It was a good and interesting raid with relatively good character development. The main character with all her whining and being upset became a little tedious. The father scene To me was out of place"
200 pages too long. But good. 
"Quick read with interesting plot twist. I didn't like any of the characters, although French typically creates characters that are realistic, not heroes."
Not my favorite of this series.....not a big fan of the protagonist and I thought the ending was a little obvious.
"I was turned off by the foul language used. Would the story be just as good without it? It was a great mystery, otherwise."
Felt vey long! Probably my least favourite Tana French.
"An interesting murder mystery. However, the personal dramas made the story feel too long."
More like 2.5 stars. Good story but a very drawn out. 
"Meh....I wanted to adore it. It felt like too much time in the police station, nowhere near enough about the crime in a substantive way or the relationships."
"Three stars for the slow start, but a fabulous payoff at the end."
"Пока самый скучный детектив Таны Френч, который я читала "
3.5 stars.
"3.5 not really good enough to round up. Somehow, the Dublin Murder Squad slowly creeping cases and stories drag me in every time."
Keeps you guessing
"too much slang

Couldn’t understand dialogue because of the local slang. Figured out killer long before detectives did. Not a satisfying read for me."
"Okay book, but a little whiny and much should have been edited out."
Another solid instalment of the Dublin Murder Squad.
interrogation scene at the end 😭
Predictable 
I need to reread this series but I just wasn’t in it 
"Not my favorite of the series, but kept me guessing on the details and still a good, dark read."
"Solid entry into the series, although the pacing is somewhat slow."
This one was biring at the beginning but unpredictable at the end. I haven't enjoyed like the other one. Took me more time to finish because I was distracted all the time while reading it.
"450 pages, got bored 1/2 way, Conway hostile, arrogant, so much was vague or ambiguous."
"The ending was good, but overall not as good as the rest of the series"
Pretty good. Liked the flowing language but it make it too long. 5h
"Hlavní hrdinka je neskutečně protivná. Ale původně hloupě znějící zápletka nakonec má ne nutně nečekaný, ale rozhodně dobrý závěr. "
"Good, but the first half was so slow. I liked how the narrator flirted with being unreliable, but just really struggled to get into the story until nearly the end. "
"First half slow. Second half really great. So much language, though."
DNF. This book was okay and with a mildly interesting plot but I lost interest in it and had to return it the library. I might get it back out one day and see where it goes. 
"3,5 får den även fast det inte går att betygsätta så med appen."
Eh it was okay for me took me a while to get into never finished it fully 
"Everything is painstakingly realistic about this novel, the descriptions, the dialogue, except possiblyly the ending, which I found disappointing whether it is realistic or not."
Slow but enjoyed
"Audiobook - 3.5 rounded down
Story - 3 (as great as Tana French is, I felt like literally nothing happened here).
Narration - 4.5"
Kinda like John Grisham and Claire Keegan had a baby
"I wanted to like this more. I just really didn't like the main character much, so it was hard to care what happened. A lot of people are just really mean to one another and nobody comes out ahead. "
"It's implausible, but I like the protagonist Antionette. She is interesting. The dialogue can be awesome, too."
It was never ending. I was easily distracted throughout the book. It was hard to get sucked in. 
"If the rating were based purely on suspense/wanting to read on, it would be higher. The plot was extremely intriguing. I’d probably give it 3.5 or 3.75 if I could. "
Not to impressed with the weak ending but still enjoyable read.
I liked it. I’ll keep reading this. 
"6e et fin de la saga.
Attachant.
La série 'Dublin murder' l'adapte en entier en une seule saison."
I haven't read any in this series before reading this one so I found it difficult to follow the story.
"Another book I wish I could give 3.5 star ranking to, it was a bit too wordy and drawn out but is still was a good read. "
Took over half the book to really get going and these books are long.. it’s a lot to read to finally get to something good. The last two chapters were good but not sure I loved the book overall 
"Good overall! Took quite a while to come to the end, like lots and lots of detail which I didn’t think was necessary and also quite complicated and hard to understand at times but did enjoy :)"
"A very wordy book that I thought would take me a month to read, but the story pulled me along. I wish there were more in the series, but I've read them all."
Enjoyed the gritty authenticity in this book.
"oops...started with the 6th in the series :( too late,,, damage done"
"I finished this audio listen but the female main character , detective Conway, was so unlikable that by the last few chapters I did not want to hear another word coming out of her mouth. "
I found it a bit long but enjoyed the twists and turns.
3* Mildly interesting detective novel
Found the book difficult to get through. The main character was more annoying than intriguing.
"A good read but a bit over the top in describing the doubts and angst the main character, Antoinette, goes through. It is hard being a woman in a man’s world, no denying. "
"Strong 3, but not strong enough to be a weak 4. Lots of twists and turns, but the book seemed to drag on."
Love Tana but this book was a bit too long for me. I also had some trouble finding characters I liked. 
Good. Better than secret places.
"Weakest one, imho"
probably would have liked it more if i had started the series from the beginning
This was my least favorite book in the series. It was a cliched story/plot and I am glad to be done with it.
This was my least favorite of the series. There wasn’t much excitement. I felt like it was mostly the detectives in the squad room waiting for reports to come in. 
3.5 stars… 
"Slow, repetitive, sad."
Disappointing 
The cop did it!
I need to stop being disappointed when reading this series but tbh I read it to listen to the Irish accents.
"A very well written book that moves very slowly from point to point, making a far fetched plot seem almost logical. It’s an investment but worth a read"
Fun read however drawn out more than required for the story 
I remain searching for a Tana French novel that made me feel like into the woods did. This was decent though. 
alittle slow
"Not as atmospheric as her other thrillers. Almost all stuff about a murder detective squad and an investigation into a murder. Staying mostly in the squad so a bit claustrophobic for me.

"
Lots of angst
3.5 stars. Could have told the story a bit quicker. 
"Not my favorite of this author. Very slow, repeating of the same issues, unlikable main character. I was hoping the buildup would lead to a satisfying ending but it did not. "
2.5. I hated this narrator so much.
Not my favorite Tana French but still a good and entertaining read.
This book had tons of great detail but it needed more action. 
Ditto my mom's review. 
"I listened to this book on Audible and did enjoy the characterization by the narrator. It was a good story but I just think it took too long to get to the end to discover the murderer. I am definitely in the minority when it comes to ratings. I just did not like it enough to give it 4-5 stars.
The build-up was so slow that it took away the 'thrill of anticipation'. The element of surprise also just went out the window.
Initially the author presented a very likely suspect but I never believed that he would have done it. I really wanted the author to ""get to it"" and end the damn story.
Wanting to know how the whole thing would be resolved made me continue on and finish it."
Too many red herrings.
Meh.
Love her books but not my favorite..not her best.
"This was pretty disappointing. I love Tana French, and have read every book she's written.

I'm not sure exactly what was off, but a couple things jumped out: the pacing was VERY slow (usually you feel like you're holding on for dear life), the main character was really hard to empathize with, I guessed the ""whoodunit"" early (and I can never guess), and in general it just wasn't so much fun.

Tana French fans should skip this one, and enjoy the rest of her work."
"There's lots to like about this book; my favorite thing is the stream of sick burns Antoinette dealt out as she navigated a workplace of leering, jeering men. She's a character that lives on her feet, rarely caught on her heels. "
Had me guessing the whole time. I cannot wait to start another one of her books. 
"I hated every single character in the story, I felt like most of the predictions were not based on anything realistic. I also hated the end of this book because we don’t really see clearly what the punishment will be. It reiterates the fact that bad cops get away with their crimes.

I hated the lead she was aggressive for no reason, rude for no reason and just all-around unlikable."
I so wanted to give this four stars but the ending just fizzled out. What a shame!
"I love Tana French - particularly her older stuff - which is why I always give her books a shot. Unfortunately, the last couple I've picked up have been disappointing. The Witch Elm didn't hold my interest. And now The Trespasser. While not horrible, it dragged on a bit, with the ending tied up in a nice bow that felt rather predictable. Not her best work, but not her worst either."
"Love Tana French, but this was like 200 pages too long. I felt like I read slightly different variations of the same dead end conversation for almost the entire book. Didn’t hate, but won’t reread"
Excruciatingly slow. If Conway is as unpleasant in other books in the series I don't think I could ever read another. I guess this type of crime thriller is not to my taste.
Intriguing book with an incredibly unsatisfying ending. It’s quite well-written but the passages are long and laborious to get through. 
"The story was great, the long chapters not so much. I know it might sound weird but I like shorter chapters lol"
"Three months to get through a book.. That should tell you all you need to about it. Its was ok, but not compelling. I read it at night and when I fell asleep that was that. I did get through it and never gave it up but I've never taken three months to complete a book. "
"I enjoyed the return of the two lead investigators from the last book, The Secret Place. It was nice to see them develop as a team. I thought this story was very predictable, and some of the scenarios that they discussed seemed unlikely. Feeling a little disappointed with this one, although there were a couple of interesting twists in Conway's story that were interesting."
"I love Tana French, but this was far from my favorite of her books. I guessed the mystery extremely early- far earlier than I usually do. After that, it was tedious watching the detectives flail around trying to get there too. I also found it exhausting to be in Antoinette Conway's head. I understand that she's supposed to be tough and not especially likable, and that she's in a high-stress situation. Nevertheless, there must have been hundreds of times she ""snarled,"" ""snapped,"" yelled, got angry with people, didn't get enough sleep, etc....her personality just came across as so monotonous, with so little nuance, no history, no connections, no passions.

Still three stars because it's Tana French, because the secondary characters are interesting, because some of the twists were interesting. I'll read the next one as eagerly as ever."
I enjoyed the story. It seemed slow going. There seemed to be too much infighting in the Detective Department. The newbies weren't being accepted by the old guard. In the end they did a good job and actually solved the murder. A good read but not great!
"Bonus: Review plus Dublin Cop Talk Glossary

Trespasser by Tana French

Detective Antoinette Conway of the Dublin murder squad refuses to close out a case against a pathetic local dweeb who apparently killed his new girlfriend, the love of his life. It happened on the night of his first visit ever to her apartment, where she had clearly been planning a romantic dinner, and probably much more.

Antoinette doesn’t trust the other murder detectives, who have been not only harassing her in gross, boyish and bullying ways but also seriously undermining her career. She discovers a bit of evidence that could possibly mean that someone else on the squad might be involved in the murder, or else covering it up. This makes her push back harder against the insistent pressure to interrogate the dweeb, force him to confess, and solve the case.

Because she doesn’t trust a word anyone in the squad says, she has to conduct the most important parts of her investigation outside of the squad room and away from their prying eyes. The situation is ripe for paranoia, and she almost succumbs to it when her secret theory of the crime, on which she has staked her career and for which she has risked the enmity of her co-workers, appears ready to fall apart.

Still, diligent detective work keeps turning up tiny clues that don’t match the dweeb theory even as she comes close to squeezing a confession out of him. She can get rid of her paranoia and save her career only by ignoring these clues, bowing to the pressure to solve the case quickly, and forcing the dweeb to confess. She has to admit to herself that most of the evidence points toward him.

The story is full of the details of police work: witness statements, forensics, CCTV monitors, timelines, dumpster diving, lying witnesses, witnesses who tell only half the truth, colleagues who seem to be suspiciously monitoring the investigation, cops who are hiding things from each other, long-ago memories suddenly resurfacing – and especially interrogations.

Not a word is spoken in this long novel without a hesitation, a biting of the lip, a quick glance between partners, a sudden intake of breath, or some other indicator of the emotional state of the speaker or listeners – and every single one of these reactions is analyzed by Antoinette as evidence of guilt, innocence, duplicity, doubt, fear, withholding, repression, gloating, bravery, cowardice, or something else. The intensity of it gets a little oppressive. Author French’s skill at dissecting these communications is remarkable, but after a few hundred pages of it you get the feeling you are watching a writer show off rather than following a critical element of the plot. You almost wish the detective would just go into a bar at some point and say “I’d like a hamburger” and the waiter would just say “okay,” and that would be that. This style makes some of the very long interrogations seem endless.

The plot comes to a satisfying conclusion, but only after yet two more long interrogations of a suspect, only one of which seems necessary.

I really liked the writing. One of my favorite passages occurs when Antoinette, tired after completing a long witness interview, sits in her car watching the passers-by with an exhausted detective’s eye:


I … watch the people going past. They make me edgy. Dozens and dozens of people, they just keep coming, and every single one of their heads is crammed with stories they believe and stories they want to believe and stories someone else has made them believe, and every story is battering against the thin walls of the person’s skull, drilling and gnawing for its chance to escape and attack someone else, bore its way in and feed off that mind too. Even the cute little student mincing along in her flowery dress, the shuffling old fella with his shuffling spaniel, they look Ebola-lethal. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. Maybe I’m getting the flu.

"Excessive

The baseline story is good but I have read two of her books now and it seems like there are excessive things added just to increase book length and it gets tedious"
"Will need to read another book by this author to make up my mind about her. The book was awesome in certain places and off putting in certain others. I didn't find the protagonist too much to my liking although I rooted for her till the end. Bring bold and being rude, immature and prickly are two different things. Too many curse words, too many little incidents plugged in to show the bravado of the lady which felt forcibly contrived to elicit the empathy of the reader. The flow of the text somehow didn't make it an easy read. There was a twist that came more than half way across the book which was unexpected. But it felt like betrayal as I was misled down a totally different angle along with the detectives! And yet it was a book that compelled me to keep going until the end just to figure out what actually happened."
"I took a six-year reading break, but I had to come back to this because it's Tana French . Was it worth it? Eh, the book was alright, but I enjoyed her previous works more.
 
This was my first time reading the author's works in the original language. The one thing I was looking forward to the most was French's prose. Instead, I got the main character, Detective Antoinette Conway. She's tough, angry, badass and close to her breaking point. And this was reflected in the writing. Even if it took me a long time to warm up to the protagonist, Conway is still a compelling character. 
I'm not sure if my prior joy with the series was created in translation, but the writing style, which used to be one of my favorites, is here mostly just vulgar. I actually felt cheated.
 
 "
"It felt illicit to read a mystery when I wasn't on vacation, so at first I liked French's ""The Trespasser"" a lot. But then it got long. And the Irish brogue wasn't easy on my eye or my brain. So it was a lot of work all around to finish this book. I'm not sorry I did. It was deeper than most mysteries, especially about the character of various women, including our heroine. And I may read more of French. But it will be on vacation next time."
"Another solid read. Tana French does not disappoint with her characters. Hate to think of vile people committing these crimes, but they are believable enough to be true, complete with your everyday character flaws."
"Huh, so apparently I've listened to this audio book twice. I have no memory of it at all from the first time. "
"It was just Ok. I had previously read ""The Searcher"", which I thought was a much better book. This one went on a bit too long. The main character (Antoinette) is not very likable, so that makes it harder to read. I almost quit about half way though, but struggled on to find out who did it."
"3.5. French's novels bring to mind a fine orchestral composition. Crescendos and deep gullies; a tense high note vibrating violently, a careful silence. French is a master of the slow build. Not my favorite of hers, but not my least favorite, either. Less engrossing than I would've liked. In so much of French's work, the atmosphere is a character; not so much in this one. Still hooked me. "
Lots of twists and turns from French. Keeps you guessing until almost the end.
"At this point, I'd like French to vary her narrative voice a little. She gets the frustrated, bitter cop really well, but it felt a little repetitive for the series. I liked the story and mystery, and felt pulled by the plot, but wanted a little more depth or complexity. The father stuff felt weird/pointless - could've been completely erased from the plot.

"
I love this series overall but found this specific book difficult until towards the end mainly because the lead character was just so darn crude and narcissistic and unpleasant. I’m so done with the crude names calling and “tard” schoolyard taunts and thought process. Ugh
"I think Tana writes not a simple detective story. She just describes different relationships and responsibilities and personalities and makes you experience it.
"
Another good book in the series. I liked how the author brings in different characters that were mentioned in previous books and you get read more about them.
"Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran are the low investigators on the murder squad. They get the nightshift which wind up being mostly domestics. They seem to pull a good case as they are finishing for the night. Their head puts an experienced investigator with them just to make sure things are done properly.Men on the squad seem to give Conway a hard time (this is in her voice) so she doesn't trust many there. Her partner seems okay.The new case takes on a sinister note because there seems to be a mysterious boyfriend lurking around the edges. He may be gangster or just married. Whatever the case, he seems to know how to hide his tracks and put someone else in the crosshairs. Breslin, the experienced investigator, is in favor of arresting the current boyfriend. But the boyfriend may be a set up.We follow down the rabbit hole, not sure whether what we are seeing is tainted by Conway's view that the whole squad is out to get her."
"Love the continuity between the detectives chosen to be the central character and the books, but man, it was hard to be in Antoinette's head for that long. Bitter pill to swallow! 3.5 as a result."
"What a coincidence! I finished this Irish book on St. Patrick's Day! Sadly, I didn't love the book. It took forever for me to get into it. But, on a good note, I liked the ending and was happy to see ""who did it"" wasn't at all who I expected. "
"Although this book had a somewhat interesting plot line, it was slow moving and not a page-turner for me. I do like the strong female lead though."
Compelling and fun but at 417 pages it's 207 pages too long. I actually often found myself exhausted mid chapter/soliliquoy/endless conversation....
I had a really hard time getting into this story. I just wasn’t that interested and didn’t really care about the characters or how they were trying to solve the crime. The only reason I finished was because I wanted to know whodunnit. 
"The website ""ate"" my review 11/21/19 Basically I thought there was an excessive amount of detail, an endless number of false starts, and an overabundance of the lead woman detective's thoughts. I thought it would never end![

It was a police procedural involving the murder of a young woman. There are interesting theories about who committed the murder, spawning numerous subplots. The unmassking of the perpetrator was the best part of the book. A somewhat disappointing work from a popular author"
Good narrator. Convincing story.
"Eh, it was ok. A good little mystery that meandered a bit at times. A few subplots were completely unnecessary. It was a little too noir for me, and there was too much inner monologue. However, I enjoyed that the author is Irish, and I had fun learning new Irish slang! While I figured out ""whodunit"" pretty early in the book, it was satisfying to finish and find out that I was correct."
"I consistently find myself fascinated but also highly annoyed with the various detectives in the Dublin Murder squad--Detective Antoinette Conway is so, so angry and she has every right to be. I will say, I really enjoyed it but was really frustrated by her growth as a detective and as a human. I also really enjoyed the murder case this go around. "
"I feel like the book was dragging on and on until the last quarter of the story. I almost put it down about half way through, but was reading it for the book club I'm a member of. The story did get more interesting in the last 100 pages or so, but it seemed to drag on prior to that point. I was excited to read this book as I don't usually read mysteries. Well, I feel a bit let down. Also, the book could have easily been condensed. Big/long read. Time is precious. "
"This is a pretty standard police procedural. The main character is a female detective on the Murder Squad. She and her partner are assigned a pretty run of the mill murder that looks open and shut: the boyfriend must have done it. But, of course, there'a a lot more to it than first meets the eye. The story is fairly interesting, but it is made more interesting because it takes place in Ireland, so it gives you a window into the culture there. The slang, however, is a little hard to get through, and I was kind of put off by the emphasis on the main character being harassed by her co-workers. One redeeming quality to that story line, though, was her recognition in the end that her attitude about what was happening skewed her perception, making a difficult situation much worse. "
Fine book if you run out of other things to read. No clue why the title is what it is. 
"Past books have been real page turners, this was more of a slow read."
"I am super greatfull to have received this ARC of The Trespasser in return for an honest review. All opinions expressed are my own***


I've only read two other Tana French books, both of which are part of her Dublin Murder `squad series, both of which I really enjoyed, one of which I nearly had to stop reading because it was to tense. However, this does not seem to be quite up there. I'm not abandoning this book because it's badly written, but because it's incredibly slow and right now I need something a little different. I fully intend to finish it before the year is out, I'll stay home on my own new year’s eve if I have to, so my bookmark stays where it is.


The Trespasser followed Detective Antoinette Conway, who I first met in the previous book The Secret Place , also a first-read, and a high rating as she investigates the murder of a woman who looked vaguely familiar. I don't mind Conway but she is very... how do I put this? Masculine I guess. The Dublin Murder Squad books don't shy away from what I imagine it to be like on an actual murder squad, so I understand why she had to be so strong, and forceful and intimidating in such a male-driven career path. But, this isn't a character I can personally identify with and this makes things a little difficult in this first person narrative.


As I mentioned, I haven't finished this book, so I can't say anything about the solution, because isn't that what a good mystery's all about, but what I can say is that it is very slow paced. In fact, it's so slow that I just cannot even imagine what the next step is. So far, I'm really not liking the sub-plot involving some of her co-workers, which may eventually become relevant to the case. I think in reality I like my mysteries a bit more Agatha Christie. However, if something is clear already it is that this slow pacing definitely enables any theories or possibilities to be definitively ruled out before moving on to the next one. Clearly there is some serious detective work going on.


I feel terrible that I haven't finished this, but sometimes it's just a case of the wrong book at the wrong time


***UPDATE 09/12/2016***


I’m back, and I literally just sat down and powered through the second half of this book to finish it.

Since I’ve more or less given a small re-cap of the plot above, I’m not going to repeat myself, but I will say that my feelings haven’t really changed. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really glad that I have finished it, but it’s definitely not one of my favourites. I can’t fault the writing, or the plotting or even the characters, since they’re written so well, but it just wasn’t my cup of tea. As I said before, I didn’t bond with Conway, and that didn’t change in the second half of the book, which is a huge problem when she’s your main character. Even the inclusion of a personal storyline, did nothing to warm me to her, and to be honest wasn’t properly dealt with at all. It seemed to have been included just to be a red herring and that was that. It’s never addressed again.

Since this is completely spoiler free, I’m not going to tell you who the killer was, or why, but I will say that I was really disappointed. I like a big reveal, or I’ll even settle for a little reveal, instead we got a super slow build up, that lasted for what felt like half of the book. I can see how you might want to argue that it’s a more realistic approach to the murder mystery genre, but it just wasn’t for me. By the final chapter, I was still waiting for a shock reveal, a twist, but The Trespasser just didn’t have one.

So there you have it, a review for the newest book in the Dublin murder Squad series, and, out of the ones I’ve read, my least favourite. For me it was an extremely slow burner with very little pay off at the end of the day. I want to thank Hodder & Staughton for sending me the ARC through the GoodReads giveaway. Thanks for reading!
"
"Good, but not my favorite of French's books."
"Going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars...but I'm landing on 3. I always look forward to a new Tana French story, and I had waited until I had time to read carefully (to catch the clues). And, like her other books, this one is well written. I usually enjoy the build up to the chase as well as the chase, but this one seemed so mired in Conway's fighting herself, that I didn't lose myself in the story like I usually do. The last 1/3 of the book was a great chase and well worked. I just wish I had felt the same about that build up."
"The storyline was great in this book, I would have given it 4 stars had they not said the ""F"" word EVERY SINGLE PAGE. I do not like that word, at all, so that is the reason for the 3 stars. The story is a fun murder mystery that keeps you on your toes throughout the whole story. Good read if you could somehow edit the foul language."
"Not the best in the series, in my opinion. Strong characters but not a lot of action. I still love Tana French's writing style and will continue to follow this series."
"More reviews available at my blog, Beauty and the Bookworm.

The Trespasser was my Book of the Month choice for November. Book of the Month tends to stay away from series selections in general, but there have been a few that appeared in the time I've been subscribed; The Trespasser is one of them. It's the sixth book in French's Dublin Murder Squad series, though it can definitely be read as a stand-alone book, which I suppose justifies its inclusion.

The plot revolves around the main character Antoinette Conway, who finds herself and her partner (Stephen Moran) investigating the murder of a young woman named Aislinn Murray. At first, Antoinette assumes the case is just a domestic, as that's all she and Steve ever get handed. But they desperately want the case to be something more, something exciting, and the more they dig the more they're shifted between nothing exciting and something that they are not ready to dig into.

In all, this is not a particularly twisty mystery. I'm not normally good at solving mysteries, but I got a sense of where this one was going pretty early on. French included enough waffling that I had doubts at a few points, but I never bought into the big red herring, which I normally fall for hook, line, and sinker. There was also no ""big reveal"" that left me shocked and awed. The solution, when it becomes evident, is pieced together bit by bit rather than just slamming into the reader like in some mysteries. I also expected Antoinette's father to play a bigger role than he ultimately did. Given that the book starts off with her history of stories about him, it would have seemed like more would be going on there than there actually was. I didn't necessarily want a tearful, heartwarming reunion, because that would not have been in Antoinette's character, but having it tied in a bit more completely would have been nice. I was also hoping that something more exciting would happen with Steve, and that he wouldn't be all he appeared--though I think if I'd read the book before this, maybe my perceptions of this one would have been different on this front.

Here are what I think the high points of the book were. I did like the use of the slang and language here. Normally I'm not big on phonetic accents, but I think French did well in using just enough slang and phonetically-spelled words to give the story the flavor of setting, but without making the bok a mental exercise to read or creating difficulty in deciphering what the characters were saying. And while I ultimately didn't like Antoinette as a character (I felt she really did have a victim complex that primarily served as something for everyone, including her, to whine about) I did like the concept of her. She's the only woman on the Murder Squad and she's a minority to boot. And ultimately, though she and Steve pursue some crazy theories, she is ultimately the skeptic on the team. This is refreshing, as female partners on male-female teams in fiction are typically the ones with the crazy ideas. Antoinette in this respect was very much like Scully from the X-Files; she wanted to believe that there was something crazy going on with the case, but she was ultimately the grounded one on the team.

Overall, I think this was an enjoyable book, but nothing to rave over. I'm actually very surprised it made the cut for Goodreads Choice nominations for 2016, because there was nothing in that really wowed me. Still, I found the noms for those awards very lackluster in general, so I guess it fits in.

3 stars out of 5."
"Don't like the forced review

Do not want review this book right now, I want to access my next download, but this fascist system is forcing me to type >20 words before allowing me to move on.

I paid for the book, I am not obligated in any way. Tremendously annoying."
"Not my favourite in the series, but French is as always a master of creating multi-faceted characters and reminding readers that things are never just black or white."
"This was my first book from the Dublin Murder squad - a book club member highly recommended the whole series, so we started on the book that they left off on. Overall, I love the concept of the book series, reminds me of the Marvel series i.e. each book is connected in some capacity and the sidekick or smaller character becomes the main character of another book. The book started off really slow. It wasn't until more than halfway that it started picking up. The main character of this series frustrated me, and there was no resolution for the murder that happened. They ""caught"" the murderer but ultimately there's no detail on how or why the murder happened, it's all alluded to information. Will try again reading from the beginning of the series and see if my opinion changes when I see more of the writing style."
French is one of the best in the world at her trade. Procedurals told from the inside of the head of the central character. While this book is good and builds as it progresses it is not up to the standard of previous books. But I still look forward to the next one and hope we do not need to wait two years.
"I was eagerly waiting to read the latest of the Tana French creations. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to find a paper copy of the book in Indian bookshops and in Amazon, I settled for an e-book from Amazon. After a series of extreme ratings on her books, I have to admit my disappointment with a moderate rating here. But, French has set the standard so high that any 'I liked it' rating should translate to an 'I really liked it' rating for an average mystery author.

The story starts with the predicaments of our protagonist detective in the Dublin murder squad, Conway within the murder squad. Even though she hadn't been with the murder squad for a long, she had experienced the subtle, but intense hostility of her colleagues. She assumes that all those are parts and parcel of being the sole woman in the squad. On an early winter Sunday morning, unexpectedly she was paired with another rookie, detective Moran, to investigate a routine looking murder of a woman, who was apparently preparing dinner for a date with her would-be lover. Soon the investigation ends up in a tangle of several divergent mysteries and deep into the departmental politics which would ruin the career of Conway.

This book also follows French's typical pattern of picking up a single protagonist and drilling deep into their flawed personalities, which usually messes up the ongoing investigations in very subtle ways. So, her detectives are not the self-sure, epitome of rationality Poirots. Instead they have too many flaws and these flaws would often compromise the rationality for the sake of their own egos and often this ends up in delayed investigations. So, unlike Agatha Christie's style where the personality of the victims and the witnesses create the drama, here most often the detectives themselves make the contribution to the drama. And it looks like she is getting to perfection in her art as the time progresses. Once I had attempted how Dorothy Sayers tried this technique and failing miserably and I was very skeptical about this technique. However, French has very much convinced me about the use of it now.

While this books takes the approach to perfection, I didn't like the flaws of this protagonist enough. But that's nothing against the novelist. It is just another level of interaction, i.e, between the reader and the protagonist, which didn't go well due to the psych of the reader. In this aspect, the constructs here resemble that of the 'Faithful Place'. Detective Mackey there and Conway here, both are little over pessimistic and self righteous for my taste. And the grimmer part is that towards the end their self righteousness is somehow justified. However, in this book it was not so bad as it was in Faithful Place. So, I liked this one better than the other.

While the above point was very crucial for me, there were many aspects in the book that were exemplary for other authors. The way she conjures up conversations between the characters is very elegant. They are often extremely intelligent and very convincing. And often they express the mood of the situations very vividly. Then the economy of the characters. As in her other novels, here too there are only the required number of characters, nobody superfluous. However, come to think about it, there was one character which could have been edited out. However, it would be a very harsh and misplaced criticism towards her."
Loved her other books but found this one overly long and drawn out with very little suspense. Lots of discussions about outlandish theories but no action. 
"Detective Antoninette Conway is on the case of a murder investigation with the Dublin Murder Squad.

Facing this challenge, she begins to wonder: Is there someone close to her investigation who doesn't want the case solved?

She teams up with her fellow detective Moran to bring this case to a close."
"Thought it would never end. Drip, drip, drip ... on and on and on it went."
"Bleak, dark and just twisted enough that I didn't have it completely figured out before the end. Not my favorite French effort, but solid."
"Thank you so much to Penguin Random House for providing me with a copy of this book for an honest review. As always, all opinions are my own.

Oh boy, where do I even start?

Well, let me first say that I haven't read the other 5 books in this series. I don't think it is necessary to read them all in order/before starting one of them, but I think it might have made me like the book a little bit more.

To be honest, this book let me down. I was expecting a thriller and I got a mildly suspenseful crime fiction. There wasn't really too much that was super exciting in this book.

The story follows Detective Antoinette Conway, the only female detective on the whole Murder Squad in Dublin. Normally, I'm ok with the whole ""I'm the only woman, the men don't treat me like a cop"" etc. but in this book it was just so over done. Maybe if I got some of the backstory as to what happens with Conway before this book, I wouldn't dislike it so much, but I found it so irritating. Even her daily interactions were a struggle to read, she would have a conversation with another detective and basically translate what he was 'actually' saying. It was hard to know if that's actually what they meant, or if she was just so sure they were being mean and giving her double meanings. Her bias clouded whatever you read, so you are constantly trying to figure out if she's just sabotaging herself or she's actually being messed with.

In terms of the crime itself, basically a young woman is found dead in her home after an anonymous caller reported that she ""needed help."" The detectives immediately suspect the boyfriend, he was coming over for dinner, rang the bell, and when she didn't answer, went home. But it becomes clear pretty early on that he couldn't have killed her, he doesn't seem the type. Still, every other lead the detectives get is a dead end.

I think my biggest problem with this book was the fact that there were no other suspects that seemed plausible, but at the same time, the obvious one just wasn't fitting the bill. It was had for me, as the reader, to get into the story because I just didn't feel like we had enough information to find any more suspects and because of that, the story dragged on.

This book is almost 500 pages, and it easily could have been reduced. There was a lot of extra stuff that didn't really seem necessary to me, then again, it might be because it was part of the series overall, not just this book.

The writing itself was good, like I said earlier, a little slow, but not that bad. I did find myself skimming a bit, especially towards the end, just because I was ready to get it over with.

I did almost DNF it about halfway through, I just didn't feel invested in the story and that it wasn't really going anywhere. In the end, I finished it and just feel meh about it.

I think my main problem lies in the fact that this book focuses on the detectives and their lives, and less on the actual crime. I think that for these sorts of books, I would prefer the crime and less on the detectives, unless it has real value to the story. I just don't know if the personal elements, at least of Conway, really added anything to the story.

Overall, this just wasn't my cup of tea."
"I was disappointed with this new novel from Tana French. Compared to the previous 5 Dublin Murder Squad Novels, it was very slow paced and at times seemed to focus too heavily on Detective Antoinette's paranoia rather than the case itself. There are some excellent interrogation scenes and some interesting plot twists, but overall this is my least favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad books. If I had not been reading a Tana French novel, I may have stopped halfway through because nothing was pulling me through this novel in contrast to her other books."
It was a page turner... fun read. My only criticism is that if you're not aware of Irish slang some of the writing ( words) can be elusive 
"3.5 stars.

My least favorite so far, but still a pretty good read. the thing i loved most with her previous novels was the underlying story. the interesting spin. the who dun it part is always excellent with her, and was in this story too. It was just lacking depth that all the others have had. Honestly this is probably a 4.5 star, but i am judging her against herself."
To damn long. Much extraneous material. Somewhat less than satisfactory ending.
"I’ve heard a lot of good about Tana French’s mysteries, so when I found a copy of The Trespasser in the Friends of the Library sale in October, I decided I could splurge the fifty cents on the book to see if I would join the ranks of her followers.

In The Trespasser, Antoinette Conway is a detective on the murder squad, but as a newer transfer from missing persons, she’s getting a lot of flack from the other members of the squad. The only person she seems to get along with is her partner, Stephan Moran. Antoinette is rough around the edges, and she’s ready to prove that she’s good at her job. When a murder case is finally presented to her and Moran, she’s determined to find the murderer- even when the case proves to be more complex than the rest of her squad thinks.

The body of Aislinn Murray was found resting on the corner of her fireplace hearth, with markings that looked like she was punched and landed there. The apartment was set with food in the oven, the dining table set for a cozy dinner for two. Antoinette and Stephan expect it to be a cut and dry domestic dispute, but then Antoinette realizes she’s met this girl before, back when she was still in missing persons. Upon examining the scene, they find that there’s very little evidence of anyone beside Aislinn in the apartment- but there had to have been someone else because the oven had been turned off after Aislinn was dead. As the case starts to get interesting, other members on the murder squad start to interfere. Antoinette keeps a close eye, certain to not let them underestimate her- especially when she finds out that their main suspect is not the murderer.

Eventually, all is revealed, but it’s a super slow burn before the end fireworks. I really enjoyed French’s diction (and the way she incorporated Irish words), as the writing itself felt very elaborate. However, I didn’t care for Antoinette as a main character, and how she was constantly stewing over how everyone was against her. I felt she was just very negative, though she was otherwise very sharp and intelligent. This also made it difficult to focus on the murder case. I was surprised by the reveal of who did it, but only until that point, I was pretty bored with the whole thing and certainly struggled with the slow pace. I thought about DNF’ing it many times, but then something would get me to keep reading just to find out how everything wraps up.

Overall, I think I’ll give French another chance, but that I wouldn’t recommend The Trespasser unless you’re into the super slow murder mysteries with a tough as nails female lead."
"This book, The Trespasser by Tana French is the first book I have read from her books.
The things I really like about this book is that she gave me a new female protagonist and that to a Murder Detective, which I know I would really like, whom I have come to fall i love with. She is independent, has personal insecurities and a need to prove her worth to other, in and out a genuine character that I can totally relate to and understand. Secondly this is a part of a detective Novel series which i definitely love. Series is a blessing because even after you complete a book, you know that there are more coming out and you can still see you favorite characters come to light and shine for you. Thirdly I love the way she had described each and every feeling and thought that passes thought the protagonist, it shows how much love and care she has for Antoinette, which many authors don't have. I loved the way she described even the professional and emotional turmoil that Antoinette had during the case and how it connected her to her pwn issues.

Now for the cons in the book, the main drawback i felt while reading the book was that its plot was too simple for me. I could identify the killer by the time i reached half of the book. I felt that the plot needed more thought put into it and more twists and turns. Secondly, the detailing given for the case was not much when compared to the detailing given to the characters. The characters are well woven and is developed when compared to the case on which it was build upon.

Overall I enjoyed the book for its characters rather than the plot. Having said all this, I really liked Tana French's writing style and will love to try another book from the series as the characters have made me fall in love with them."
"I wanted to absolutely LOVE The Trespasser, but I just...didn't. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I'm not going to be raving about it. Definitely an intricate story with twists & turns that keep you second guessing over and over. "
"Detective Conway, the only female and the sole person of color on the murder squad, has a chip on her shoulder. She is always trying to prove herself and assumes that everyone is teamed up against her. ""The stuff people think I should try to hide -- being tall, being a woman, being half whatever -- is the stuff I keep up front and in their faces. If they can't handle it, I can use that."" She is self-destructive in this way, and her personal issues stem from a long history of abandonment and mistrust. Her language is raw and masculine, and even hilarious at times. When Conway is assigned to a murder case, she is determined to prove herself.

The victim, Aislinn, a young, single woman, was murdered in her apartment. The obvious suspect is her new boyfriend who was due to arrive at her apartment for dinner that night, but Conway doubts that this thin, sensitive man could have committed the crime, which seems to become more complex and convoluted as the investigation progresses.

Conway discovers that Aislinn was more manipulative and complicated than it seems. Her father left suddenly when she was a young girl, and she was determined to find out the truth of his disappearance by befriending one of the investigators on his case, only to become more deeply wrapped up in the mystery than she planned.

The murder case has many twists as the story unravels, but the more interesting aspect of the story is the similarities between Conway and the murder victim. While drastically different in personality and fashion, both women struggled with ""daddy issues,"" never really got over their abandonment, and questioned whom they could trust. As a result, the reader isn't sure whom to trust either as the mystery unfolds. Were both women fated for failure? Were they doomed to be victims? Even though one character is alive and one is dead, the reader is inclined to reach inside the minds of both women and figure out their motives and desires. Conway reflects, ""I was doing exactly the same thing as Aislinn: getting lost so deep inside the story in my head, I couldn't see past its walls to the outside world. I feel those walls shift and start to waver, with a rumble that shakes my bones from the inside out.""

The title is also interesting. Who exactly was the ""trespasser?"" Was it the murderer? Or someone else? People seem to trespass into each other's lives in different ways.

Another noteworthy theme is the idea of rescuing people: ""If someone rescues you, they own you. Not because you owe them -- you can sort that, with enough good favors or bottles of booze dressed up in ribbons. They own you because you're not the lead in your story any more. You're the poor struggling loser/helpless damsel/plucky sidekick who was saved from danger/dishonor/humiliation by the brilliant brave compassionate hero/heroine, and they get to decide which, because you're not the one running this story, not any more."""
The 6th book in the Dublin Murder Squad series. A dark and atmospheric mystery.
"The trespasser is not a bad book, the mystery element is interesting but at the same time the build up is slow and it becomes a bit uninteresting. Due to this reason I not gonna lie got bored a lot of times. Sometimes times a slow build helps build up thr story properly but this time it didn't feel like it was done that well. The ending plot twist was unexpected but at the same time it wasn't that kind blowing."
"Ultimately I liked the book, but it took awhile. I do think it was too long and it seemed to take forever for things to happen. Antoinette is quite a character and her hard style can grate, even when mustering some sympathy for her.
Anyway, if the first two thirds of the book were pared down by half, I would've liked it better, however, I don't think this tale was up to the quality of previous books, either in substance or mystery, although it did present some tricky situations."
Appreciated the unexpected killer. Did not enjoy the sense of persecution which felt too much like teenage angst throughout.
"I would have liked to have given this book as high a score as many other reviewers but found that I could not for a couple of reasons. First, while the book was generally well-written, I found it moved too slowly. There were a lot of descriptions and conversations that could have been cut or omitted entirely. Pages upon pages are devoted to interviews of the murder victim's friend and potential new boyfriend that include a multitude of details that are not really needed. Second, one of the lead detective's colleagues insists that the victim's new boyfriend was the killer so strongly that one can tell that this rush to judgement means that he is innocent.Finally, once the reader can tell who the actual murderer is, it takes (again) numerous pages to ""wrap up"" the case. "
Took a long time for me to get through this. Just didn't go anywhere for so long.
"what happened? so much worse than the previous stuff. the pace is so off. she still needs an editor, people! just because someone has a way with a plot and has done very well in the past doesn't mean you can leave them alone! should have been half the number of pages it was."
"I will confess this is the first book in this series that I've read. I got it as a part of my Book of the Month subscription. The book was well written overall, but it's not written like your typical mystery book. This book is just as much about the central protagonist as it is about a murder. If your looking for exciting fast paced thriller, I wouldn't pick this one up. That's just not the type of book it is. It's interesting and the characters are interesting and well fleshed out.

The focus of a good part of the story is about Detective Conway and the social dynamic of having a multi-racial women in on the Dublin Murder Squad. A good it of time is spent on her struggles to fit in and feel like she can continue to work for the squad given the hazing she is experiencing. The book is written in first person so you go through Conway's thoughts and emotions as she and her partner Moran work the case. The inner dialog is well written, and the character dialog is great as well. The interactions between Conway and Moran are great and so are the interrogations and Conway's inner commentary about her fellow Detectives.

I picked this book because it was the mystery book for the month. Mystery is usually my genre of choice when I want to read strictly for fun. I usually choose books that are smart and fast paced. This book is definitely smart, but the pacing is a little slow for me. It didn't leave me wanting to go pick up the others in the series. I don't think you need to read all the others to read this one. It was fine as a stand alone. It's a great book, it just doesn't fit my personal preferences for mystery books. It was slow in the middle and I found myself trying to hurry up and get through it so I could read something else. That's not a good sign for a mystery book. I readily put it down to watch something more interesting on TV. I could stop mid-sentence or chapter without a problem.

The character writing is great and if you like character driven books, especially books with strong female leads, you will like this book. Conway is funny and her character is interesting. I was more interested in how she was going to find a way to stay on the Murder Squad and work out why the ""lads"" were harassing her so badly than I was in the actual murder. I'm sure if your a mystery reader you could figure out what was going on pretty quickly. I was a bit distracted by all the other things going on in the story.

"
I had some difficulty with this book. I couldn't stand the protagonist. The story itself was interesting and engaged me enough to keep reading but I just could not feel anything likable about Antoinette Conway. 
"The first daunting French novel that misled readers with the antagonist twist of corruption. Most ""relatable"" victim to common citizen, and packed with French's sharp seeds of mystery, that blossoms a plot most unsuspecting. A page turner, though not my favorite French suspenseful story."
"This was meh. I figured it out in the first chapter, and then spent the rest of the book watching the main characters bumble around not finding it. There was an explanation for this, but it was unsatisfying and I could not buy it. That kind of ruined the thrill for me. Well written, but just kind of missed the mark. "
I thought it kind of dragged on.
"I don't like mysteries that have to TELL you why you should be suspicious. It should be subtly sprinkled through descriptions and things character see/say, not the detective saying ""well it's obvious so and so is the killer, but I have a bad gut feeling about this or that."" There's no fun in those mysteries. There's no way to try and solve it yourself if everything is based on ""what-ifs"" and gut feelings.

I finally did get intrigued by the book... 300 pages into the dang thing. After 300 pages, it seemed that the Ds gut feeling was right and there was more to the mystery than meets the eye. I only wish that realization would have been made sooner so I didn't waste my time with all of the what-of scenarios they played through the first 300 pages."
Most of my friends really liked this book. One gave it two stars. The fact that it took me over two weeks to finish indicates that I didn't live it. I read tons of Irish noir but the slang in this book was largely new to me. Dragged on but I had just enough curiosity about the resolution to finish. 
3.8
"While I enjoyed the dialogue and protagonist POV in this book, holy crap it took forever to get any sort of traction in the investigation - the first near-300 pages of this book were all dead end leads. Once the suspect was revealed and confirmed, the explanation was relatively satisfying and I appreciated the lack of plot holes, but not at the cost of how long it took to get there.

3 or possible 3.5/5"
"I had difficulty with the ""slang"" language used in this book since it was set in the UK. it was distracting at times. It might not bother you. But if you can get past that, its a good murder mystery and worth the read. Good twists
"
"While I thought the book was fine (I was happy to read a mystery for book club) it was not a favorite.
The basic mystery is a good one however getting there is as someone else mentioned and I agree a slog. I wouldn't recommend this as an airplane read unless you want to fall asleep. I was about 2/3 of the way through the book when got rolling and I finished all at once. Up until than I'd pick it up and put it down. The whiny angst was boring to me and made the story heavy. That part was so heavy handed, it made me think of Top Chef or Project Runway when you just forward through all the 'drama' to cut to the chase. Her characters were described where I could easily picture them and the settings so she doesn't lack writing skills. This one just fell flat to me.
In reading other authors who write book series, there are peaks and valleys so I'm chucking this up to a valley and will try another one of her books."
"Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed about joining the murder squad, but years later it isn’t what she thought it would be. Vicious pranks and harassment around every corner, from everyone except her partner, Stephen Moran. When another by-the-numbers lover’s quarrel gone bad is handed to them and their commander assigns them a babysitter ‘seasoned’ detective, Conway is seriously considering handing in her notice.

Conway and Moran work hard to piece together what should be an easy enough heat of the moment crime to solve. But none of the pieces surrounding the life and murder of Aislinn Murray are fitting together the way they should be. Plus, Conway knows that she’s encountered the murder victim somewhere before. With their ‘babysitter’ detective pressuring them to arrest Aislinn’s new boyfriend, a busy-body reporter making them look bad, Aislinn’s friend hinting that she knew Aislinn might have been in danger, and a shadowy figure watching Antoinette’s home from up the hilly road things are beginning to point towards a conspiracy. The only question now is this conspiracy in their heads? In Aislinn’s life? Or in their department?

Being someone that enjoys a good mystery, author Tana French is a welcome addition to a ‘must read’ list. Antoinette was a really great character to follow, she is just enough of a strong willed female that you rally behind her, but also belligerent and stubborn enough to find irritating at times too. With her mixed heritage and almost abrasive attitude, readers can’t tell if perceived prejudices are because of her personality or actual discriminatory prejudices. We do know that it is because of her abrasive personality that tension rises between co-workers, forcing Conway and Moran to find creative ways to investigate their case.

Enjoyable all around read that is a great introduction to this author. I wasn't aware that it was part of a series when I picked it up but will definitely go back and read some of the other novels now!"
"I found the first half of this (long) book, relatively hard going. I was both fascinated - and put off - by the dense detail of every police interrogation, every conversation or description. This slowed things down a bit too much for me.

The protagonist - Antoinette Conway - is by no means a likeable character. Not a problem in itself. Except I thought her patterns of reaction and language became tedious. I like books written in vernacular and I like books about Ireland, so I really have nothing to complain about. But the constant use of the word hole, to refer to one of two human orifices, got old for me. The predictably belligerent outbursts became slightly irritating. I did, however, like Antoinette's partner Steve. He was so much more nuanced and interesting. He had more than one expression and reaction.

The excitement built towards the end, but was I really excited by the story, or the prospect of the mystery resolving itself and releasing me? I look forward to Tana French's next book, as I loved the other Dublin Murder Squad books and every writer is allowed one in a series that a reader doesn't care for."
"Good story, good writing but this story was way too long."
"More like 3.5 stars, really. I always love Tana French's books, and this one was a heckuva lot better than THE SECRET PLACE, but I dunno... While a solid and fun mystery, I didn't exactly find myself engrossed in it and I felt like French's trademark tying together of similarities between vic and detective and other larger themes felt kind of forced and overworked to me. Not in a way that seriously detracted from the enjoyment of the story, but just in a way that felt more effortful than I'm accustomed to from French. The whole ""daddy issues"" theme (even though French did turn this on its head at times) wasn't one that especially interested me, and I can't say I felt that dimension brought a lot of depth to the story for me.

My main problem with THE TRESPASSER was the length: French's books are always quite weighty, but this one in particular felt like it dragged. I often felt like I'd read an entire chapter or two without any significant progress being made into the current investigation or without any big reveals/anything being turned on its head and I felt a lot of time was spent exploring theories that ultimately were red herrings/dead ends. I wouldn't go so far as to say I was bored while reading, but I did find myself occasionally impatient with the lack of forward movement in the case. The mystery itself was really interesting and juicy once it did pick up steam, but French took longer to get there than was necessary, and at some point, it kind of became clear who the murderer had to be just simply due to the utter lack of any other possible suspects.

All that said, I'll totally keep reading whatever French writes. To date, I would rank her books in this order:
1) BROKEN HARBOUR
2) THE LIKENESS
3) IN THE WOODS
4) FAITHFUL PLACE
5) THE TRESPASSER
6) THE SECRET PLACE"
"I too am a Tana French follower and while I liked the Trespasser, I didn't like it as much as some of the earlier mysteries - probably because I found the cover up of ""who did it"" somewhat strained. Detective Antoinette Conway is a tough, if not belligerent, member of the Murder Quad where she is the odd ""man"" out. She can get pretty paranoid about the other detectives and assistants intentionally withholding information but she has grounds since most of them can't stand her either. She and Steve, whom she does get along with, are assigned the case of Aislinn, a young woman found dead in her apartment. Her boyfriend, Rory, becomes the prime suspect, but as the other detectives on her team keep pointing to him as the killer, Conway digs in and insists on examining all aspects of the case. It takes too long for Conway to re-interview Aislinn's best friend, Lucy, who spills the beans that Aislinn was involved in a relationship with one of the detectives, McCann, in the Murder Squad, who kills her in a rage when he discovers that she has a boyfriend. The twist is that Aislinn was deliberately leading on this detective because he was the one who mislead her about her father's disappearance much earlier in her life. It was a bit of a stretch that Aislinn was able to woo McCann, a fairly committed husband and father, with the intention of getting back at him for not telling her mother that her husband (Aislinn's father) was found, having run away with another woman to Europe (I think) and that the husband had asked McCann to let them know. Aislinn was furious to find out that McCann intentionally witheld this information from her mother and her so she wooed him to get back at him. "
"I was lucky to have won this book in a Goodreads giveaway.
Although this book is part of French’s Dublin Murder Squad series, the book wasn’t my favorite of her books. I am not sure if it was because I couldn’t connect with the main character, Antoinette Conway, or the fact that it took awhile for me to actually become invested in the story line. However the last quarter of the book prevented me for putting the book down, and finished it in one night. The plot is pretty straight-forward – a young woman was found dead in her room, with evidence not making the case clear cut. Although Conway has her doubts, another detective, Breslin, is pushing the investigation to one suspect. Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, came up with various theories, but the case was not a simple shut and close case.
If this is your first time reading French, I would definitely go with another book."
"As usual, French creates her story from previous characters in the Dublin Murder Squad mysteries. The great thing about her books is that the detectives' stories are as important as the murders they are solving. This one brings back Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran from The Secret Place. Unfortunately, Antoinette is not in a good place with her squad, and the book just gets lost in her self-pity and negativity. There are fascinating details about the inner workings of the murder squad, and the ending is nice, but it's not nearly as compelling a story as her earlier books."
"Love Tana French so was excited to read this one by her! Honestly kind of slow at times though, but the plot twist was good and I enjoyed it overall. Not my favorite mystery by her though"
"This is the 6th book in author Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series, but the first for me. I found no difficulty reading it as a standalone. This was also my first pick since signing up for the Book of the Month Club, a forcing mechanism for me to include new hot books in my reading repertoire.
My three-star rating means that I consider this book pretty good, but not great. It means that I enjoyed much of the book, but not all of it.
This is about the murder of a young woman in her own home on a Saturday night. The book started out slow, with stretches that felt like mere filler. As the plot developed, the motives behind some of the key happenings lacked credibility. Would a young, attractive woman really sleep with a frumpy man twice her age just to figure out why her dad disappeared in her youth?
The narrator is the detective who is co-in-charge of the case. She is a multiracial woman who experiences discrimination and harassment from within her Murder Squad. A lot of time is spent highlighting incidents and comments that the narrator is forced to cope with, but these become a bit tedious and distract from the main plot.
On the good side, this book did become very suspenseful in the second half. And some of the secondary characters developed nicely and became more real in the latter part of this book.
This book is a hot 2016 book and it is generally rated higher by others. It was good enough for me to consider going back at some point to an earlier book in this Dublin Murder Squad series to see if a Tana French book reads better now that I am familiar with her writing style."
"Not the best case

When Detectives Conway and Moran are assigned this murder case, they anticipate just a domestic case like the others-- easy over and closed. But what they anticipate is not what they have because of the fears and motives of the members of the murder squad.

Is Dectective Conway capable of putting aside old grudges against other detectives or is she being baited for a fall? And us Detective Moran able to set aside his desire to make this case had s big break or is he part of the reason Conway is unable to bring this case to a swift conclusion? Is the boss of the murder squad hoping Moran and Conway will succeed or fail? Is star Detective Breslin assigned to push them along the right path or does he have a hidden agenda?

The mystery is less about who killed Aislinn Murray than it is about the psychological vagaries of each detective. And how does the personal history of each detective determine the course of this case? The victim and the lead detective had father's who abandoned them and left them vulnerable and yet focused on becoming stronger because of their loss. We watch the endless criss-cross of what makes each of the characters make wrong assumptions, avoid obvious dangers, make personal alliances just to then have greater doubts.

Unfortunately, French seemed to distrust her readers to understand the psychological underpinnings and spent so much time having them weigh each possible word, glance, and thought of the various witnesses in light of the victim's life that tedium resulted. A mystery thriller needs red herrings built on something greater than the characters' abilities to step outside of themselves."
"I rated this book 3 stars -- just barely; could easily have been 2 or 2 1/2. The reasons are as follows:
* I don't like all the gutter language and casual references to 'Jesus' as a swear word. A little of that I can overlook, but this book goes too far.
*The story could easily be told in 100 less pages -- it rambles endlessly at times. accordingly, i found that I skimmed many pages -- and couldn't wait for the book to end.
*I found myself constantly trying to understand the meaning of British/Irish slang words and phrases.
"
"Read my full review on Rosepoint Publishing.

Protagonist Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner, Detective Stephen Moran, begin work on a new case involving Aislinn Murray, whose death is easily and quickly attributed to her new beau by the veteran detective who took lead in the interview.

Detective Conway is pushing back, however, her gut telling her this quiet, ineffectual man could NOT have been the one to cause Aislinn’s death. She is wondering, however, with the obvious circumstantial evidence, if she is getting paranoid, considering all the hazing from the guys.

Tana French is nothing if not verbose—I’m glad I went the audiobook route as that included narrator Hilda Fay who didn’t just read the book, she became Detective Conway allowing the reader to live the rest of the narrative riding on Conway’s shoulder, heart, and mind, hitting the nuances of French’s dialogue and thoughts with depth of emotion, philosophy, and circumspect anguish.

The problem is, with ALL that dialogue, and ALL those recriminations, and ALL those subtle disclosures of the nasty pranks from the guys, the novel tends to lose sight of the story arc and extends exponentially when it could easily have been conveyed in under 300 words. The interdepartmental rivals and pissing matches become a broken record and loses the plot spit and fire.

French does pull all her various threads together in spectacular fashion in the climatic conclusion thrusting home her theory. It’s a hallow victory—sad—unsatisfying. But it’s a win. 3.5 stars"
"I really like Tana French and I looked forward to this book. One of the reasons I've liked her past novels is that she doesn't stick with the same characters book after book, and in one case (her first novel) the murder was not solved at the conclusion of the book. The ""character"" that is the same in each book is the Dublin Murder Squad.

So back to this book - it was really dense - chock full of descriptions and overlong sentences. It bogged down the pacing of the novel and at times I found myself skipping descriptive paragraphs just to move the plot along. I think part of the problem was that you were following detectives try to out-detective one another and they know each other's tricks and techniques for getting criminals to give up information. And every sentence was followed by another sentence explaining what was going on - just tough to read.

The protagonist in this installment of the Dublin Murder squad is Antoinette Conway, a character introduced in the previous novel. Although I understood her problems with the men in her squad - she was not an easy character to sympathize with or to follow. In some chapters it was like listening to a middle schooler go off the deep end about not being ""popular."" She took advice from no one, read into everything everyone said and did and was always finding ways to tick people off. I know enough people like this without having to read about one too.

But I did want to find out how they solved their murder case, and I did. Its worth reading, just don't expect to move along quickly."
"Summary:
Being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.
Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.
And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.
Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?

My Review:
This is #6 of a series, yet I didn't get that message and just read this one. It didn't really make a difference- sure- there were past refrences I didn't get, but it was actually ok. This is a pretty good read. I liked the mystery."
This book took me forever to get through. It was decent in the beginning and then drastically slowed down for about 100 pages that dragged on. Picked up at page 250 and I finished the book within 2 days after that. The unexpected twist made me glad I stuck with it while it dragged on and on and on. 
"Love this author/series, but not this book. Found it difficult to get into and thought there was too much unnecessary filler. Nevertheless, good plot and character development. Will continue to follow the Dublin Murder Squad."
"I always go into Tana French’s novels with two questions: who’s it gonna be and how’re they gonna get it? This time it’s Antoinette Conway, the half South American, half Irish, all woman detective with a chip on her shoulder the size of Dublin Castle itself. When Conway and her partner Moran are partnered with oily senior detective Breslin on what appears to be a routine domestic murder, Conway’s suspicions rise. There’s something more to this case than the gaffer and Breslin are letting on, but she isn’t sure what. Could it be a test of her skills? A gang connection? Or something more sinister?

The Trespasser didn’t disappoint. French’s mysteries twist out into directions that I never expect, and I find myself wandering among tangled what-ifs and who-could-ofs until finally when I think that I’m lost beyond all reasoning, I find the answer smack dab in front of me. Conway was an interesting pick as a protagonist – very different from most of her other previous heroes. There was one moment in the middle that felt very forced (you’ll know it when you read it), but otherwise the story read smoothly. (I also always try to pick out who will be the next protagonist, but I’m not positive this time – maybe Breslin, maybe the journalist…) Overall, a good read. Not her best, in my opinion, but definitely intriguing.

"I received this book through Netgalley and this is my first time reviewing one for them!

This is the first Dublin Murder Squad book I have read and I wonder if I would have liked this title more if I had read book 5 first. From what I understand each is from a different detectives point of view and feature similar groupings of characters throughout each and there have been a lot of great reviews for this series about how dynamic and interesting these characters are; however I did not like Detective Antionette Conway. She is consistently acerbic and while I am not against this type of character it did not work for me in this context. She insists she does not feel sorry for herself but the more she asserted this the less convinced I was. I thought her character was a little forced, like the author was trying too hard for Conway to be at odds with everyone. But more than that I did not think the mystery/case being solved here was interesting at all! The cases in the other books sound much more interesting and atmospheric which is what I would want from a mystery set in Ireland. With this review keep in mind procedural detective novels are not in my wheelhouse and my dislike of this particular book won't keep me from reading her previous novels with more interesting sounding plots."
Would have been better if about 50 pages had been chopped.
"This book starts off SO SLOW. It took me forever to get through the first 100 pages and multiple times I thought about calling it quits. I'm glad I didn't though. As the mystery builds it really drew me in. The author does a great job of creating interesting, multifaceted characters and I loved the element of never knowing who to trust. I also loved the answer to the who dunnit part of the mystery. It should have been so obvious. Like slap you in the face obvious. Yet I never guessed it. There's some major issues though with this book. First off, the pacing is awful. This book could have easily been way shorter if the author would have quit repeating things. For instance, when the big answer to the mystery is revealed, there's still about 75 pages left. She spends the next few chapters just rehashing details we already know. The next big problem I had was the narrator. She's got the worst attitude ever and she never grows or changes. She's surly, defensive, and just plain rude. Finally, the over the top Irish slang made it difficult to understand at times. I never want to see the word ""shite"" again after this book. Seriously, someone please count how many times our narrator says shite in this book. "
"I listened to The Trespasser by Tana French on audio, which had its downsides. It was about twenty hours long! I thought that I'd never finish it, which is not a good feeling to have lurking in the background when you are working through a book. It set a hurried tone, which made it difficult for me to slow down and really concentrate on the investigation. Perks of listening to this on audio were that the narrator spoke in an Irish accent and I could hear how the names were supposed to be pronounced, which is sometimes difficult for me!

This one was about a beautiful young blonde woman found murdered in her home. The investigation zeroes in on her boyfriend very quickly, but the detectives on the case believe that there's something more at play here. Loyalty, importance of familial bonds, and the desperation that people feel when the integrity of their lives is threatened all played a large role. And as usual, French does a great job with the police procedural. It's always fun to get an inside look at the mind of a detective and the games that they have to play to find the perpetrator. This doesn't beat my favorite of the Dublin Murder Squad Series (The Likeness), but still enjoyable!"
"Every time Tana French releases a new book, I promise myself I'm going to wait so that the space between new releases isn't unbearable, and every time I fail in that endeavor: I was devouring this newest installment in the Dublin Murder Squad books within hours of its release.

I hadn't been too keen on the last book, The Secret Place, and this book felt closer to the books I liked best in French's mysteries so far. However, this book was notably lacking the whiff of supernatural that makes her books so intriguing to me. Other than a sincere sense of Place, French's books that hint at some otherworldly involvement always give me goosebumps. It almost seemed that French was reacting to the criticism of the last book being too supernatural (it was), and so stripped all elements of that sort from this story. That said, Antoinette Conway is a great protagonist, simultaneously frustrating to deal with and yet extremely relatable (at least she was to this reader).

French, even while not surpassing herself with this one, still manages to soar past the majority of literature and mystery out there, writing compelling, lyrical, and tight stories that leave you aching for the next book."
"Not the strongest entry in the Dublin Murder Squad series, but compelling interrogations and tensions within the squad when its only female--introduced in The Secret Place--teams with a new detective to get to the bottom of what seems nothing more than a romance gone wrong. Then a lack of evidence pointing to the boyfriend and evidence of a professional hit emerge. As usual, there are personal and interpersonal problems that hinder one's seeing things clearly. Some skips in plot information and abrupt scene changes made me wonder if French is not writing too fast or with less attention to the detail. Still, she's got to be one of the best procedural writers going."
"Chapters have lengthly. Anyway the story was okayish. So many twists and turns. A different storyline though. I would never think of such things to exist but it does in this strange world. People can be cruel, selfish and ruthless. I would give this novel 3.5 star because of the long chapters."
"Took two tries to finish this book, had to return book to library and re-request. Required some perseverance in the face of other choices, but have read previous books in series and thought I should read this one. Complex and intense police murder investigation of a young woman's death, complicated by the politics of the murder squad's detectives (mis)treatment of their lone female detective, who is one of two junior detectives(the other is her male partner), who have been there for two years. They are assigned to be investigation leads for the first time on this murder call, which comes in just before the end of their night shift. The twists and turns seemed unnecessarily complex and drawn out in places, so some more editing might have been helpful. There were a number of surprises at the end, and I will be interested in reading the next volume in the series.

It would have been better to not start reading this one so close to reading Stephanie Meyer's ""The Chemist"", but both were under same library deadline for return. The vagaries of high demand library requests coming available and arriving simultaneously can be challenging.

"
"Good book. Could have been great. Solid murder mystery and detective protagonist. She and her partner have a solid relationship as they try to solve what seems like a routine domestic dispute that has become a murder. Of course it's not routine, and here is where I have some problems with the book. The two detectives seem to spend an inordinate amount of time speculating on what happened, with little or no evidence. When the protagonist interviews a key witness the chapter feels like it goes on forever in a long information dump. Overall, it:s a solid plot with a number of twists and turns and engaging characters. The writing is solid, if a little too detailed and convoluted at times. If you like solid (I'm using that word far too often!) murder mysteries and don't mind slogging through a few places, this is a good read. One thing: the setting is Ireland and I liked the use of Irish words and phrases. I often did not know what they meant but could figure it out in context. Good book. Not great but good."
"Normally Tana French is one of my favorite authors. This novel again set in the Dublin Murder Squad does hold my interest but it was not one of her best books. There was too much anger expressed by the main character Antoinette Conway, previously introduced in The Secret Place. She and her partner Steve Moran investigate the murder of a young woman probably by a boyfriend. What they discover is much more than an ordinary domestic case. They are considering all motives including gang retribution. Because they are relatively new detectives, their boss assigns an experienced detective Breslin to ""assist them"". When they begin researching the life of the victim, Antoinette realizes she met the victim at some point in the past. When the connection becomes apparent Antoinette and Steve are drawn into a very complex situation affecting their future careers. My only complaint is the amount of time spent by Antoinette expressing her anger at the squad and her life in general. It is of value to the story but seemed to slow the story down to a crawl at times."
"Unfortunately, I didn't like this book near as much as Tana French's earlier books - (my favorites were ""The Likeness"" and ""In the Woods."") I feel her books are getting worse; I didn't care much for ""The Secret Place"" as the college jargon and banter got old. Spoilers ahead. In this book, ""The Trespasser,"" I found the confession completely implausible. These were seasoned detectives, and the guilty detective did not have to confess because there was insufficient evidence and he knew there was insufficient evidence! I think a more interesting book would have been an internal investigation for the tampering of evidence by the guilty detective and an internal investigation for his partner's actions. There were also too many coincidences in this book. Also, I found it hard to like the main character. That being said, it was not boring to read or difficult to get through. I was always humored when French used the word ""snort"" which kind of made me snort a couple times! I'll be more hesitant to read her next book."
"Ok, so I'm very, very tough on Tana French with these Dublin Murder Squad books. I think because ""The Likeness"" was just so great and I loved the whole undercover concept so much, that none of the others have really had the same effect on me as that one did (although ""Broken Harbor"" might be a close second cause that one definitely surprised me).

Anyways, I enjoyed this one overall. After being kind of underwhelmed by ""The Secret Place"" (because lets face it, the mysterious unexplained magical element to it got a little frustrating/silly) I was still glad to see Moran back for a third novel and Conway back for her second. I had missed the female detective perspective since we lost Cassie after the second book. And although Conway's perspective is definitely a very rough and tumble one, I liked combing over the mystery in her mindset.

While I must say I guessed the twist before even getting halfway through the novel, I did find it interesting enough to keep me going. Tana French is just great at mysteries overall and, of course, I'm already looking forward to the 7th book!"
"Tana French's mysteries are always twofold for me. There is the actual mystery that the novel is written about and then there is the bigger mystery as to why Ms French insists on dredging the reader through endless, boring conversations that inhabit perhaps more than half the actual book. Don't get me wrong, her mysteries are always good, when she finally gets to the meat of them. And, inevitably, once she gets to the main course, several characters have to sit and discuss the whole thing forever. In this story, the two lead detectives spend endless pages sitting around speculating about this theory and that. If you like long stretches of dialogue and very little action in your murder mysteries, Ms French's stories are perfect for you. I personally believe that she could have cut out one third of the narrative and it would have been much more fluid and exciting. While I've given it three stars, I am happier that I actually finished the book rather than feeling any regret that it is over. I don't know how eager I will be to read her next book."

"3.5

I have read all of Tana French's books, always been a huge fan. If Tana is churning out books, I'll be buying them without question because she is one of my go-to authors I can count on. That being said, this one wasn't my favorite although I'm glad I read it.

I found this one bogged down with detective procedure and the workings of the case SO much that it took away from the personal lives/personality of the characters which I always enjoyed reading about in the other books.

This one was slow for me and I expected more twists and turns but they weren't here. I also had a love/hate relationship with Antoinette. I like that she has a ""take no shit attitude"" (and I can understand why) but she seemed so harsh that she couldn't distinguish between friend and foe.

Anyway, I enjoyed the writing but I miss the poetic way with words Tana French had in In the Woods and her other books. My guess is that she made all of her choices for a reason and they were well executed, just not my favorite of hers."
"An important caveat here is that it's rare that I read crime fiction (Louise Penney's Inspector Gamache novels notwithstanding). I read about it in the NY Times and decided to try it, without having read any other work by Tana French or the preceding novels with the compelling protagonist Antionette Conway. In its favor, the characters felt true to life (easy suspension of disbelief), the friendships authentically complex, and the writing itself excellent. The plot twists kept me guessing the entire time, and turning pages for the ""what's next?,"" all of which are good. All the way to the end of the book, there were surprises and tremendous suspense. What kept me from giving it four stars instead of three is through no fault of the book, but rather my own sensibilities. Truth told, the gritty coarseness got to me. I usually read before falling asleep for an hour or two, and with this book, I saved it for reading during my lunch hour because it was too disturbing!"
"This one was darker then the previous ones, so took me a little while to get thru it. Was definitely worth it!

"Boy oh boy does Antoinette Conway have a chip on her shoulder! We met Conway in The Secret Place and her standout characteristics—a bit hard-nosed, isolated in the squad, etc.—are played out in more detail here. While I know of at least one fellow French fan who was a bit annoyed with Conway's attitude, I actually enjoyed it—her me-against-the-world stance is both completely familiar and completely understandable, which makes her plenty accessible, at least to me. As with all of French's characters, that defining characteristic is both an aid and a major hindrance to the case, which was not as satisfying as I'd hoped. There are plenty of twists and turns, per French's MO, but at least one major revelation depends heavily on a character being a bit of a wunderkind and the case's resolution comes about almost outside the lead detectives' control—dissatisfying to them and a bit dissatisfying for me as a reader."
"I have mixed feelings about this book. It's number 6 in the series, but the first I've read, so I don't know how much I missed by not reading the other 5. (I usually prefer to start a series at the beginning, but this was a Book of the Month Club selection). I liked it overall, but felt it got bogged down a bit in the middle, and I was ready to fling the main character out the window. But the first third and last third were great, so I'll probably go back to the first one in the series and try it again. Apparently, each installment is told from the point of view of a different detective in the unit, so it will be interesting to see how the unit functions from the perspective of a character who is not the only woman. She seems to put up with a lot of crap due to her gender, so I'd like a peek inside the heads of the men. The series is set in Ireland, and while it slowed me down a bit, I like learning the Irish slang the characters use."
"In trying to keep this short, I will say that I'm loyal to authors in terms of waiting for their next book once I love them but not in blindly giving great reviews. I was somewhat disappointed with this novel and I'm a huge French fan. I remember the feeling of relishing the first DMS novel and racing through it, I couldn't wait for more! This novel left me a far cry from the feeling. There was way too much detail (I usually like this), the pace was extremely slow and all I can say is that it ended in a great way true to French's normal writing form. The stars are all for the last 50-100 pages, but the rest of the novel seemed to reminiscent of her other novels and to wait so long for something like this wasn't very exciting. I didn't rip through this book like I normally did and I also didn't love the characters that much this time. Barely a 3 for me because French can do so much better. "
"Probably my least favorite of the series, though still a fairly decent book. I never really found myself becoming very invested in Antionette. Normally when you have the ""abrasive, anti-social"" character, they are at least redeemed by being smarter or better than everyone else. But I found her far to wrapped up in herself to the point of bungling the case to really give her attitude a pass. You can be a not-terribly-nice person, but at least kick ass while doing it. I kept wishing we could go back into Stephen's head. One point that bugged throughout the book about Antoinette was how she believed she was so great on missing persons. But the only reason she knew anything about Aislinn was because she blew her off when she came looking for information on her father. Oh yeah, that's some top-notch work there. And Lord help us, please don't let the next story be from Bresslin's point of view. Sophie or Fleas would be interesting though. "
"This is my second Tana French's book (first one being ""In the woods"", another Irish setting book) and she has a very strong and unique style of writing. This book took a few chapters for me to get into; after that pretty much page turner. Great suspense of who killed Aislinn and more importantly why, the motive really left me in suspense until the end. I loved the way Tana analysis of the world of detectives minds and thought process to find the truth.. Quite fascinating! For some reason, I kept on suspecting her best friend, Lucy, and wanted the completely unexpected ending.. Anyhow, it turned out to be a great choice as the last book of year 2016, and I am so looking forward to read many more interesting ones to keep up with my three book clubs that I am actively participating! Oh the world of reading... forever and endless entertainment and amusement, and sometimes even educational ;-) "
"while i liked the story and some of the themes explored well enough, i found the suggestion that the bigotry experienced by a woc in a chauvinistic, white-dominated police department was just 'a story in her head' astonishingly offensive, and the wrapping up of police brutality and abuse of power in the half-baked rhetoric of nobility left a bad taste in my mouth"
"I've enjoyed French's mysteries. The Secret Place stands out as excellent and I've always liked her perspectives. This book was okay, but not as gripping or as intriguing as her others had been for me.

French takes main characters and has them as secondary characters in her books. Antoinette, a newish detective in Murder, has been hazed severely and takes everything personally. Steve, her partner, had been in The Secret Place, but it's been so long since I've read it that I only remember the general story and not any specifics to help me make more connections. There are many layers to the story, and the unraveling takes a while. Some of the misleading felt obvious, and I didn't care much about the victim until the end, which took away any urgency to want to read this book. However, I've always liked how French digs into the minds of her detectives."
"I love Tana French's writing. It doesn't get much better. You have to immerse yourself into her books to understand them, the writing is dense and thick, every word matters. It pains me to say I didn't care for this book. It plodded along for me. I have no problem with a complicated lead character, in this case, Antionette. She was grumpy(with reason) and not a pleasant person. Okay, no big deal. I don't know, it just didn't work on some level. The conversations all seemed too long, too involved, there was little time in the story outside of the squad room. Kind of like a one setting play. With that component, it was tedious at times. Every previous book by this author has been exceptional, with ethereal qualities you just don't get in most literature today. I was so looking forward to this book. Hoping for a better installment in the Dublin Murder Squad next time. "
"I love Tana French. LOVE. So when she puts something new out I run to read it. But I have to say that this one was disappointing. Something was missing... the subtle shades of supernatural, the connection I unusually development with the characters... it just wasnt there. The banter and ""voices"" still read as French but the story fell flat. Too much talk not enough action. I will say that in a broader scope, this book does push the Dublin murder squad series in a new direction that I hope proves interesting in future stories but doesn't happen until the last 3 chapters or so...
I hate giving a mediocre review to one of my favorite authors but here it is and I'm sad I have to wait who knows how long before the next comes out. Hopefully gets back on track. I'd hate to lose this series as one I eagerly look forward to reading."
"I found this police procedural very engaging. A young woman detective and her partner are assigned a routine death case, but an established detective takes an unusual interest in the case. Is he helping them or does he have another agenda. The victim is a young woman who was raised by her mom after her dad abandoned them. When ma died the girl transforms herself into a Barbie clone. She is killed in her home but who done it? Her wimpy new book store boyfriend or a married man suspected by her best friend? Our detectives are led up and down a number of blind alleys and make lots of errors but eventually they discover the truth. There is a bit too much description of mental states but I found myself emotionally engaged by these fictional characters so I guess that is a mark of good writing. The twist end is well set up and very satisfying."
"I've read a few other books in this series and I do enjoy her intrigue and characters and this detective is interesting and complex but at times I did tire of her inner martyr monologue. Still, I read quickly to the end so I could find out who the murderer was and what was the real story! "
"Although this is my favorite genre, this was just an average detective story. The book probably should've been a 100 pages shorter...lots of rehashing of the same crime details and the same couple of personality conflicts....blah, blah...and in a heavy Irish accent no less. I never got a handle on the ""protagonist"", Detective Antoinette Conway, who is sharp enough but tortured. She's a similar character to, but not in the same league as Lisbeth Salander (Stieg Larsen). Most telling for me was that this mystery didn't have the usual drama of a who-done-it, i.e. there weren't any of the ""ah, ha"" moments or clever twists or turns I liked in the Amos Decker series by Baldacci. I didn't mind reading it, but I can't say I'd recommend it. There are just too many other better detective stories out there."
"I adore Tana French but this was not my favorite of hers by far. The book was over written and seemed to be set at a glacial pace. The killer was entirely too obvious. I also disliked how the blurb made me think was a ""typical"" French novel by teasing an intriguing memory and a vague shadow of a man on a street. Nope. One of those was explained in an offhand/ frankly boring way and the other was completely out of left field and did not add to the story. "
"Irish detective & her partner are assigned a young female victim, the victim had a tough upbringing & looked to men for solace...good police procedural, but one twist had me shaking my head"
"A solid, well-written read. I really liked the characters, Steve and especially Antoinette, and I enjoyed their partnership. Book spent much too long on hunches that wouldn't pan out and the interrogations/interviews went on forever; could've been 100+ pages shorter.


I agree with Washington Post: ""My only reservation about The Trespasser came when French had one character carry out a highly elaborate and dangerous scheme to inflict revenge on another""// a bit of stretch Aislinn seduced and began an affair with the detective from her missing father's case in order to learn more information and later to get revenge when she learns the detective decided not to tell Aislinn and her mother that he found her father

my current TF books ranking: read 2nd/6, ranked:

."
"I think I would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't read the other five novels in the Murder Squad series. I really liked the first four for their original style, but with #5 the writing had become repetitious to me and #6 again seems redundant. French is good at slangy dialog but spends an inordinate amount of time on excessive verbal sparring between characters and the endless inner thoughts of the narrator. This is a good story overall but the storytelling is very slow to offer meaningful evidence and it became challenging to maintain interest in the investigation. Halfway through not much had really happened and I began to forget what the main premise was. The author is a very talented writer in many respects, but I may have reached my limit on these books."
"Vlastně se to nečte špatně, i vcelku odsýpá, je to slušně napsáno, není nezajímavé podívat se na vyšetřovací metody, přičemž důraz je tu kladen především na vedení výslechů. Ale to je asi tak všechno. Tana French už u mě žádnou další knížkou nedosáhla toho nadšení, jaké jsem měla při čtení V Lesích. I tak mě v jejích knihách bavilo hlavně to, jak uměla vykreslit charaktery a rozehrávat s nimi skvělé hry. Často ve mně vzbuzovala různorodé, ale obvykle docela silné emoce. Většinou minimálně několik postav mě opravdu zajímalo. Ve Vetřelci ne. Všichni mi byli v podstatě jedno, vůbec jsem neměla problém se s nimi na posledních stranách rozloučit. Přišli mi stejně anonymní, jako bych si pročítala zápisy z reálných výslechů neznámých policistů. A celou dobu jsem čekala na nějaký zásadní zvrat a ono nic. Škoda."
"After In the Woods, I felt like trying out more of the Dublin Murder Squad series, so I snatched up the next one available at the library. Each novel in the series features a different Detective in the Dublin Murder Squad as the protagonist, so the series doesn’t have to be read chronologically. The Trespasser is the sixth book in the series, which features Detectives Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran solving the murder of a young woman in her own home. Like In the Woods, the main storyline of this book includes some unique and original aspects to the mystery, which I really enjoyed. The subplot of this book focuses on Antoinette’s difficulty fitting in as a woman in a male dominated career, and I got frustrated at times with her hard-headedness related to this part of the story. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this novel!"
"*SPOILERS AHEAD BE CAREFUL!!*I reaaaallllly wanted to love this...By the end I just found myself getting to the end because it's what I had to do - not because I was dying to as is usually the case with French's books. While not entirely predictable, the ending is somewhat...predictable. If that makes sense. Like when you sit down to watch a movie and you're like ""oooooh imagine it was the cop that did it!"" and everyone is like ""no wayyyy that's too easy"" so it's almost like it was so predictable it was unpredictable. But still predictable. Ha!Anyway, all in all, it was still an enjoyable book, just not on the level of ""jesus christ whaaaaat"" that I was expecting. But that's my fault, isn't it! "
"Actually, more like 3.5 stars. This latest Tana French book is good, but I didn't love it as much as her others (even Secret Place, which others seem to hate, but I actually liked...so maybe I'm just weird.) The main problem with this one was that I really struggled to like the main detective, Antoinette Conway. I don't remember disliking her in TSP, but her tough-as-nails-'cause-I-gotta-be shtick got old in a hurry. She sort of improves throughout the book, but she's annoying more often than not. But French's writing is great, and I couldn't wait to get into the car for my commute to listen to it, which is really all I ask. Interesting story that kept me guessing, though I wish more actually happened in the story (ad opposed to all the critical parts unfolding in interview rooms)."
"To give this 3 stars pains me. Any other author would've gotten 4 but I expect more from Tana French. The writing, as usual was lovely and particularly sparse. But this one seemed to drag and I've never felt that way about her books. Also, I get that the unsympathetic narrator often works (and has worked for French before) but for Antoinette's bite and growing self awareness to work, the mystery needed to be stronger. The red herring was never believable to me and while I didn't guess the murderer early on, I wasn't surprised. I don't think I was invested enough to catch the flags. I still, however, very much look forward to her next book. I think this was a rare miss for a usually brilliant, original writer. "
"Three and a half stars. A young woman is murdered and her boyfriend is the number one suspect, except for... a mysterious other man. Antoninette Conway and her partner Stephan Moran are given the case but her colleagues are seemingly against Antoninette, peeing in her locker, god knows what in her coffee and her files go missing. French has crafted a fine mystery but she loses one star for all of the dialog in vernacular. Surely, French has a much larger vocabulary than her characters. Many of her expressions are idiosyncratic to the Dublin sub culture that have no meaning to most of us. ""Fair play to you"" must have been used dozens of times. Another half star goes off for some minor inconsistencies in the plot.
"
"Something was off here. Too much time was spent on Rory. Too much time was spent on Conway struggling to be accepted into Murder. There was no shocking moment. The Breslin factor: not that interesting. The _____ twist: it was always a possibility. French is still a master narrator. Conway's voice was consistent and pretty compelling (I really would have loved to see her beat up one of her co-workers [Roche, especially]), but her relationship ups and downs with Moran were not as engaging as they should have been. From any other writer this would be an above average to excellent work. From French, this was substandard. There were flashes of her past brilliance, but this one never took off. That's o.k. Still satisfying, but I'm hoping for better next time. "
"A lot of people reviewed this really favorably, and I liked the book a lot. I sometimes have difficulty getting into the Irish setting/language, but this struck me as a pretty typical murder mystery. There were things that were a little surprising by way of plot twists, but I think the thing I missed that so many people celebrated, is how the author really gets into the politics of a police force and the back stories of the main characters. I liked it, but I don't know that I would strongly recommend it to friends as it lags at times and doesn't feel totally original. Admittedly, I may be short-selling the powerful female police officer as a protagonist, but I am not sure that is enough to carry me through the novel with any strength."
"Tana French is an amazing writer and I have read several of her books. Some of them grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. The Trespasser was not one of those books for me.
Through the eyes of Antoinette Conway with her partner, Stephen Conway, we learn what life is like as a member of The Murder Squad. We know her every thought, every sentence she speaks and those of the other characters as well. It is an interesting homicide case filled with far too much detail for me. I had to keep reading to return it to the library but I was tempted time and again to skip to the end and be done. After reading The Secret Place which I couldn't put down and haunted me long after I read it, this one was a disappointment for me."
"Tana French is a talented writer, and the last 100 pages of this book are worth the read, but it is a long slow build-up to get there. Maybe I'm just not sympathetic to chip-on-the-shoulder women cops who obsess about the slights from their male counterparts more than they do about the case they are handling, although in this instance the two threads do overlap. This would have been a more satisfying read if it were 100 pages shorter."
"Started well and ended well but oh it dragged on in the middle ...endless, circular internal debate. So frustrating I almost gave up. I won’t be revisiting this writer. More of a two and a half star."
"3.5 stars Stephen Moran is miles more likable than Antoinette Conway, who has a chip the size of Ireland on her shoulder. But seeing their trust and partnership being put to the test over the course of the book is satisfying, and I came away for the first time liking their ""gaffer"" O'Kelly, who shows a moving integrity I wouldn't have expected. While the premise itself is tortured, there is some very good writing in here about what drives people down paths where they destroy others on their search for meaning and justice. I like the parallel story echos of the damage inflicted by deserting fathers on their children. And by the end of the book, even the stubbornly blinkered Antoinette has an epiphany that just because she's paranoid, it doesn't mean that everyone is against her. "
"this is book 6 in a series - not sure if it was needed to read the ones before - probably not

antoinette and her partner steve are paired in a murder investigation when a young woman is found dead in her apartment after being hit and then striking her head on the fireplace mantle - or the other way around

there are various plots as to maybe it's this way; maybe it's a gang; maybe it's the boyfriend - and each plot is written out so that it could be it's own story - thereby making this book incredibly looooong by at least 200 pages. also confusing because you can rationalize one ending only to be convinced it is another ending. also, antoinette is so convinced the squad is out to get her (she being the only female on the team) that it confuses the issues even more

way too tedious"
"Semi spoiler alert.

Tana French writes compelling, interesting murder mysteries. The scenes are shown to you through her writing. The conversations are so detailed it makes you feel like you were there.
This book kept me interested up until the penny dropped and Detective Conway got the full story from Aislinn Murray's best friend. Their discussion is dragging on a little too long and I am losing interest. It's not believable that someone would hatch and execute a ""plan"" like the Aislinn's.
The more I learn about what actually happened to her, the more ridiculous it sounds. Or possibly she is severely mentally unbalanced and this is the only crazy thing she has done her whole life. And that is a big inconsistency to have in a character. Anyway, I hope they wrap it up soon."
"Ever since I read the first Dublin Murder Squad book, In the Woods, I have been hooked on Tana French's books. Her books are so well written full of detail both about the crimes itself but the characters, and the plot woven together so intricately, also. I was so happy to get an advanced look at The Trespasser. This book definitely contains everything you would expect from Tana French, but for some reason, it just could not keep my interest as much as her previous books. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it didn't, and that left me a little disappointed.

I received an ARC from the publisher, through NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review."
"This book would be more intense if it were edited by 1/3. There were many times that my mind wandered, that I skipped ahead, that I pondered setting the book down.

I agree that French's superlative writing brings alive the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Dublin is a heritage anchor for Tana French's world--history, geography, and milieu-- setting commands events and character.

I felt no urgency in the resolution of Antoinette two personal arcs: her professional paranoia and her parentage. The murder investigation was interesting, but not blood-tingling or spine-chilling.

I finished the book out of obligation."
"While I will remain a devoted fan of Ms French, this title was not my favorite. (that position still held by FAITHFUL PLACE) Maybe it WAS the discomfort of being so inside her head, the squad and/or situation room, the car, the apartment. It was kind of claustrophobic...and maybe it was meant to be. If so...success! I also found this character difficult because she was so very angry all the time. Blind angry. I acknowledge she had ample to be angry about...but, would've found it more interesting if something occasionally tempered her judgement. Although, at the end, when she gave up ""being a tosser""...I also thought it all fell away a little TOO easily. Now...I look forward to the next!
"
"I had great hopes for a good Dublin read with Tana French and was very disappointed in The Trespasser. It moved for me at a very slow pace, like moving through a sludge of detail. Not until the last third of the book does the pace pick up. Not a great fan of Antoinette Conway, primary detective, but neither were most of the male detectives on the murder squad which is a large part of the narrative. Her paranoia like the long-winded novel itself got tiresome. But maybe if I had not been reading this just post election of Trump I would have been in a mental space to enjoy it more. It was not the satisfying distraction I was after. "
"This is the first Tana French book I read, and I'm Canadian just as a reference point. I didn't have trouble following the book. There's some slang in the book, but it's really easy to pick up what they mean. Now that that's out of the way, I must say I really wasn't impressed by this book. It's the worst book I've read this year. It's a good story but it's just keeps on dragging and dragging on. I was really disappointed. All the reviews I had read had mentioned that the ending was mind blowing, but personally I found there was absolutely no twist, really predictable. I'm hopeful that the other Tana French books are better because this one was not worth the 449 pages."
"I wanted to like this book. I was really anticipating it's arrival. But unfortunately it only slightly better than The Secret Place. And The Secret Place was the worst Tanna French book to date. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Tanna French fan. I love how she progresses the narrative through dialogue. My biggest problem with The Trespasser was that it took forever to pick up any momentum. That and Antoinette's paranoia took a lot of the joy out of an otherwise interesting premise. Some interesting twists, but not enough to elevate this novel above Tanna's first three installments of the Dublin Murder Squad."
"A dense, complex (overly-complicated?) police procedural. I didn't care for this as much as other books in the Dublin Murder Squad ""series."" Perhaps it was because the characters were so unlikable and I never really felt a connection with the victim or the investigators. As well, it's been a while since I read the previous books and although I recognized some of the characters' names, I don't really remember their connection or other stories - if I had refreshed my memory on that before reading this book, I might have enjoyed it more.
Readers who enjoy dense, detailed police mysteries set in current day Ireland would enjoy this."
"My first by Tana French. Slow paced and very wordy. Lots of talking and introspective thinking. Very informative of the way detectives interview witnesses and suspects. Keeps you interested in finding out who the murderer is but you start to wonder when you'll ever get there. Great characterization and you feel you really know them. I found myself rooting for Detective Toni (one tough broad) and her partner Steve and yelling out loud at parts at their adversary, Detective Breslin. Suspenseful with doses of comedy.I like my mysteries more active but will definitely keep reading Ms French's books. "
"Tana French's first three books of her Dublin Murder Squad series were so skillfully paced and plotted and recounted that I don't know how she could possibly keep up the momentum in all of her subsequent three. The second, in particular, had a plot point so preposterous that it was a testament to French's storytelling skills that I bought every single bit of it, hook, line, and sinker. Her newest one, #6 in the series, also contained some plot points that were a completely stretch, but this time around, I just didn't buy them. I also couldn't quite get a handle on the protagonist, Detective Antoinette Conway. "
"“Time after time it’s left me gobsmacked, how people will tell you things they should keep locked inside for life; how ferociously they need the story to be out in the air, in the world, to exist somewhere outside their own heads.”
*
A tough, rely-on-no-one-but-yourself female detective in Ireland tries to figure out who killed a beautiful young woman in her home. I liked the finely-drawn personality of the female detective protagonist — her fragile sense of loneliness juxtaposed with her bristly, stay away exterior. That said, it seems the detective novel just isn’t my genre, even if well-written. I found the novel quite long…."
"I have mixed feelings about this one. I adore Tana French's writing, but this plot seemed too busy with wild hypotheticals. Once the case was actually solved, I ended up feeling disappointed in how simple and obvious the answer was.

It's not my favorite French book, but I appreciate how she crafted Detective Antoinette Conway. Detective Conway isn't exactly likable--she's brash, unforgiving, and stubborn, but she's a relentlessly thorough detective. Because there's no real love interest she pursues, Antoinette is presented simply as a great cop--not a woman who needs to be wooed on the job."
"Ok, I love Tana French she is very innovative but dear lord someone anyone finder her a really tough editor! This book was way too long for a book firmly in the mystery/suspense genre. There were endless pages of interrogations while well-written often lead no where. Many many (maybe too many read herrings) while its nice to know more about the detectives I really don't need to know every email they send, sandwich they ate or general family angst. Yes I will keep reading her books, yes I will suggest others give her a try and yes I will keep hoping she drops from 400+pages to the more manageable 200 to 300.
"
"There is no doubt that Tana French can write, but she is also very good at creating unlikeable (Goodreads just tried to make me spell that wrong, and it has a read line under its own name! What kind of spellchecker is that?) characters. I really did not like Antoinette at all. She is arrogant, judgmental, and just not a very nice person. Maybe that would come with the job, but I have certainly liked French's detectives better than this in the past.
The mystery and the resolution are second-rate as well. I hope she writes a better one next time. I always look forward to her books, and this one was a disappointment.

"
"This is my first Tana French book. What I found most interesting was the look at how the Murder D's worked the case and the look at the techniques used in interviewing witnesses and suspects. It felt very realistic. What disappointed me about the book was the main character-- Antoinette Conway--feeling of persecution--real or imagined--by her squad mates. For me, it was overdone and, while it did play a role in how the investigation played out, it became a distraction. I wanted to tell her to get over it. I also had a little difficulty with the Irish dialect--my problem--where I tried to look words up to get the context. I would rate this 3 1/2."
"Possibly my least favorite of the series -- Tana French is still awesome, but Conway is the hardest-to-like protagonist she'd had so far. She does a good job of explaining why Conway is the way she is, and the character develops in a satisfying way, but she's so goddamn self-destructive that it makes it really hard to keep reading.

This is also not really the most interesting mystery so far -- it's again done very well, and Tana French is a genius, but it takes a very long time for you to become in any way emotionally attached to the victim, which makes it harder to care how it ends until fairly late in the book."
"One of my least favorite Tana French books. Way too long. My biggest complaint is that the main character, Antoinette Conway, is very unlikeable. It was unpleasant to be inside her head. Her parter, Steve Moran, was the main character in French's previous work, The Secret a Place, and I enjoyed that one much more because of a likeable detective."
"Engaging story with enough twists and misdirections to keep me entertained. I found it hard to like the protagonist though for most of the book. She was so self absorbed - admittedly with good reason most of the time - and sure that the whole world was out to get her ( there were people out to get her ) to such an extent that I found it hard to raise the righteous anger on her behalf that I should have felt.

The reader was great with what sounded like a mostly authentic Irish accent.

I might read more from this series except that there are so many really great crime novels around I might not get to them."
"The first time I read The Trespasser, this was my review:
""A satisfying murder mystery, one where even after you figure out who done it, you're still guessing about what's going to happen next up til the very end. I liked it, but I think I would have liked it more if I had read the series starting at the beginning. I will put the rest of the series on my ""to read"" list.""

When I reread it a few years later, I did not remember who committed the crime, although I figured it out fairly quickly the second time. Since I was not in such a hurry to know the ending, it was easier to sit back and enjoy the details."
"Rounding up from 2.5. My first Tana French book, and I am unsure of the hype.Honestly, this one felt a little long and obvious. Like, there was a lot of repetition and red herrings, but it felt like it could’ve used an editor. I appreciate the Irishness and some of the phrasings. I liked the badass female detective, but the sexism and “woe is me”ness wore me down. Finally, maybe because it was the 6th book, I just didn’t care or feel connected to a single character, Vic D or otherwise. I may try her first or most popular book to see if I’m missing something, but I think others have done it better or may be more my jam. "
"I thoroughly enjoy the Dublin Murder Squad series. The Trespasser was a little slower going for me than usual. Antoinette, the narrator, wasn't entirely a sympathetic character, and I felt some degree of distaste for the manner in which the detectives pursued their suspect. Overall, however, I enjoyed the novel, and was surprised to learn the identity of the murder. The Dublin Murder Squad novels, overall, are not easy reads, but I heartily recommend all titles in the series. I received this as a digital ARC, courtesy of Net Galley and the publisher, in return for an honest review."
It was an okay book. Not the best of the the series. The case seemed easy to solve but takes 450 plus pages. This one is very character driven (which most of them are except Secret Place) so most of the book revolves around Conway personal issues. This is the first time she has used the same detective pairing for two books which was nice because you get the other ones perspective and personality. As a result I have no idea who the next detective will be for the narrator. My guess is Roche but it could be Breslin if he survives.
"I received this book for free through Goodreads giveaways with thanks to the author and publisher.
This is the first book in the crime series I have read by Tana French and felt it could be read as a standalone novel in itself.
In this book DI Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephen Moran are brought in to help when the body of a young woman is found.
While I like a ""whodunnit"" I found the writing style quite difficult and the pace of the novel slower than I would have liked. However overall a satisfying unravelment and solution to the case."
"3.5*
Perhaps the timing was wrong for me; perhaps because I didn’t read this book and instead listened to it (love the accents!) but I found it too long, too drawn out. With Antoinette spending too much time going over the same things in her head. Still good book but I just felt it could have used some editing.
I know I’m in the minority – see all the 4 and 5* ratings! I have read or listened to the others in the series and enjoyed them, giving the first 4 more stars but #5 in the series left me a little flat too. That said, I’ll still read the next one that Tana French publishes.
"
"Once again, screwed without a kiss. French led us on, only to retreat from any true closure in the first of her Dublin Murder Squad mysteries, In the Woods. And now she's done something almost as fraudulent: she circles around the same plotlines, the same suspects, the same clues - only to come up (I won't spoil it here) but for my money, she came up with jacks.

"
"3.5 stars. This is number 6 in the series...I've only read the first book before but it was easy to just pick this up without knowing what happens in 2-5. I listened to this book an loved hearing the Irish accent of the narrator. This was the kind of book where the world and characters the authors creates are more interesting and entertaining than the murder plot. Frankly, I thought the murderer was pretty clear early on but Antoinette's struggle in a man's world and her relationships with her police partner and her father kept me engaged until the end. "
"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of French's books, but this one just didn't quite work for me. While ultimately the mystery was solved with quite a few unexpected turns, it took forever for this book to take hold and start moving along. I think this is because the book is mostly dialogue with very little action to move the plot forward and some of the dialogue seemed to go on forever. It didn't help that I did not particularly like any of the characters either. Had this book been 50 pages shorter, this may have been a solid 4 stars for me. "
"Interesting for its twists and turns, and who the murderer turns out to be. The detective telling the story is a bit tiresome in a ""nobody loves me everybody hates me guess I'll go eat worms"" kind of a way, and I'm happy to say that by the end of the novel she has grown up a bit.
Not one of French's better offerings. I know that Irish people swear a lot, but it seemed to me that this cast of characters did so more than those in her previous books -- maybe I just don't remember? But talk about a book where ""every other word"" is a swear word, this is it."
"I found this tangled, twisted story to be a great read, but oh, so slow. The murder case Antoinette Conway catches early one morning is anything but the clear-cut case it starts out to be. Plus her whole squad seems to hate her, and are pushing her to fail. There is a lot going on, but the way every single, solitary, repeating, right or wrong, relevant or not, obscure, or obvious (get the picture) thought is here made me wonder if I was ever going to get through this book. However, I did like how it all concluded, and I will probably read the next Tana French novel as soon it comes out."
"My opinion is that ""The Trespasser"" is not as good as her previous books that I have read. I did not like the whiny nature of the main character, Antoinette, an Dublin Murder Squad detective. For that matter, the whole squad was pretty unlikable. The situation of the murder itself was not believable. Antoinette's father showing up added nothing to the story.

The book is well written. The plot just made no sense to me. But I will still be looking for the next Tana French books. ""Into the Woods"" is my favorite to date.

"
"For me Tana French is not the same writer everyone else enjoys. I stopped reading 1/3 way through and took a break. Too wordy and too many of the words were dialect and slang. To use a British term, it was "" a slog"". After the break I skipped about 150 pages, saw something had happened and skimmed back a bit to find the meat of the story then continued to the end. I appreciate everyone that loves French's writing, you are what made me finally finish and not just give up but in the future maybe I will skip the next book totally and realize even good writers are not for everyone."
"This book has a lot of twists and turns however it is a bit long. The story is about a young girl who is found dead (murdered). She looks like she is getting ready for a dinner date at her home. Detectives Antoinette Conway and Steve Moran are assigned the case with detective Breslin helping.

Then the story goes on and on with several ideas on who done it. It ties together in the last 100 pages so as far as I was concerned the book could have been a little shorter but it was still pretty good."
"The Trespasser felt like it was making up for the departure from her normal subject matter in the last book (The Secret Place) by giving us extra police and departmental procedure. It didn't flow well for me. One thing French has been excellent with is taking previously unlikable or unnoticed characters and making them sympathetic by giving them extra dimension. The protagonist in this book never got that extra dimension. I felt no connection or interest in any of the main characters and while the book was ok, I was glad to have it finished."
"Enjoy her writing...but

Dialogue was lengthy and the plot was too slow moving...wish we could have gotten there more quickly. As always, I enjoyed her writing style and the time she spends on her main character."
"I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via Net Galley. #6 in the Dublin Murder Squad series. I love to take a little dip into this series as a break from the more serious stuff. I was engaged by the mystery plot and enjoy the regular squad characters, however I found the overall narrative a little restricted by the fact that the story was so focused on the Squad itself. French has more room to shine when she includes a broader cast of characters."
"I received an ARC copy of this book, and was quite excited to read another of Tana French's books after two years.

However, I had problems with this book. I don't know why, but it just went on forever. There is so much filler where there didn't need to be, and I ended up skipping to the last two chapters to find out who the murderer was. Even in doing that, I was left confused by how it ended. At some point I'll go back and read the rest, but this left me unfulfilled."
"I got this as an ARC from Netgalley. Tana French is a master of getting inside people's heads and this book is not an exception. Antoinette has a chip on her shoulder with good reason, her coworkers don't exactly like her or hope she succeeds. They do all in their power to hinder her success on the squad. You spend most of the book wondering if she is going to throw in the towel or kick their butts."
"I'm a fan of Tana French, but I couldn't finish reading A Secret Place because it was too contrived. Now, having just finished The Tresspasser, I'm disappointed again. The story did not have any major twists or turns, and the paranoia of the narrator was forced. I feel badly that these last two books haven't lived up to her first few, but it's the truth. I do wish her all the best and I will continue reading whatever she comes out with. I just hope the bug of the early books bites again. "
"Tana French is the queen of the twist, that is, a plot twist. You think the main thing she's describing is the main thing but then, behind door #1 is the twist.

Her latest book about Irish murder detectives is well-conceived and I waited anxiously for that twist which never occurs. Still she's a great writer. If this had lived up to her other previous works I'd have five-starred it in a heartbeat."
"I didn't enjoy this one as much as her others. There is more focus in this book on the ugly internal office politics of the Murder Squad, and a lot less on the actual case. The narrator, Antoinette, is understandably very paranoid (people are out to get here) but her strident narrative voice gets a little tiring. Ultimately, it's not bad, just not my favorite. I'd definitely recommend people that who haven't read her books don't start with this one."
"The murder mystery was compelling, if a bit convoluted, but I really liked the characters and the personal demons they brought to the murder squad. There wasn't a lot of action, but I think I prefer the introspective stories anyway, so I was quite happy with it. I had a difficult time believing some of the situations and how characters behaved at times, or I'm sure I would have given the story 4 stars. "
"Antoinette is really unlikable, so it is frustrating to put up with her self-defeating crankiness. The book seemed to be more ok with paranoid theories being true than I was- that's hard to explain without spoiling, but basically the resolution of the mystery seemed no less randomly pulled from the air than the alternative theories of the case that Antoinette mocked. Still, I enjoyed reading it and wanted to know what happened."
"I really wanted to love this book, as I did her first novels, but the writer just did not stay on point. Her asides and flashbacks were so disruptive that I had to reread to remember the initial point. The book is too long, mostly because of the interruptions. You know that the detective is not popular, but the point is made in every scene, so that after a while I didn't care any more. Sorry Tana French. The mystery would have been great otherwise."
I didn't like this book as much as the other books she has written. The plot development was very slow and where there is usually an interesting twist in her other books there was none here. I did like the character development and the interaction between the characters and I also happen to like her writing so I enjoyed the book. But I would recommend one of her other books over this one to anyone who hasn't read Tana French. 
"Probably 3.5. This one is as beautifully done as the others, but I found it more of a slog for some reason (possibly having to do with the circumstances of reading it--being so busy I could only catch a few pages at a time, instead of reading straight through). It has an amazing ending--but one that makes you realize that the (sympathetically depicted) myopia of the main POV had occluded the more interesting stories going on around her."
"I was very disappointed with this book. I have really enjoyed all of Tana French's other books but I was bored to tears with this book almost all the way through. If I had to pick this book out of a lineup of Tana French book I wouldn't be able to tell it was her's, that is how different it felt to me. I didn't seem to have the same language/structure I am used to with her or depth of mystery. I hope this is simply a one off."
"3.75 Stars
Detective Antoinette Conway is on the Murder Squad (Ireland). She’s the victim of harassment and vicious pranks. She’s tough but is close to breaking. What looks like a by-the-numbers case pushes her and her partner into darker currents.

I liked Antoinette and her rapport with her partner. She’s a tough but paranoid (with reason to be so) cookie. The plot was good although a bit weak at the end but it was an enjoyable ride.
2016(65)

"This book had more details about the police department and the investigation than the story. In parts it felt a bit tedious to read. She eventually got back to her story and a few twists that I love about her earlier books. I'm glad I finished it, but I enjoyed the Likeness and Secret Place much more.

Also - it really bugged me that the author wrote dialog where the characters frequently said, ""Me and ____."" That's like nails on a blackboard to me."
"It looks like I am in the minority in finding this book just OK as opposed to French's other offerings. The plot is solid as far as cop stories go, but it dragged in the middle for me and could easily have been 100 pages shorter. I also was consistently irritated with Conway's ""the world is out to get me and screw me over"" attitude that was prevalent until the end of the story. There were some surprises and some strong characterization of Moran and Conway but overall I was underwhelmed. "
"Oh, it was such a disappointment. I had read her other books and loved them. This, instead, was a labor of waiting to get interested. 450 pages of small print written in Irish dialect! A story of office politics and malevolence, of missing fathers, neurotic heroines, neurotic policemen. The ending was, however, nicely done - all wrapped up and tied with a ribbon. At last, I read with interest."
"Not quite as compelling as the others in the series, but a Tana French mystery is always enjoyable. For a change, the detective isn't wrapped up in the essential mysteries, though there is one personal tangent that connects her to the case. And Conway isn't the most compelling detective either. French hits you over the head about her defensive chip on the shoulder a little hard for my taste. I'll always be a Tana French fan, though!"
"Very disappointed. I was looking for a page turner and this was not it. Very drawn out storyline about a young woman found dead. Someone calls it in to the murder squad in Dublin. Looks straightforward and isn't. But oh does the author drag it out endlessly. While the actual murderer may be surprising, somehow the narrative isn't written in a surprising way. I was oh so ready for this to be over. A few chilling suspenseful set-ups that go no where. "
"Immaculately written as always, just not as gripping for me personally as some of the other books in this series. It gave me a deep understanding if the drudgery involved in detective work, but that wasn't necessarily a good thing. The energy in the book, like that if the investigation, dragged in the middle. Loved the characters, just felt like the red herrings they were often off following were not that compelling. "
"I liked this much better than The Secret Place. This is French back with the Murder Squad and inside the only woman detective on the squad. Solving a murder, which originally might be mistaken for a ""domestic"" evokes childhoods without father's, sexual harassment and what is real and what is in your head. The narration is tight and typical French. I'm not sure why I didn't give it a full 4 stars - but it is a solid read."
"I would give this book 3.5 stars. Tana French's plot lines are always so developed, but this murder mystery was lacking in details for a while. It took a long time for that piece of the story to develop. There were many stories. I did end up liking the characters in this book, but Antoinette was the most well developed. Most of the story was about her and her life. The ending did resolve some issues, but almost not enough for me. "
"Tanya French created a protagonist who was borderline paranoid and quite foul mouthed. She worked her way through several people's psychodramas until she discovered the reality of her situation. Perhaps it was the language that made the book difficult to read. She was trying to solve a case and gain respect from the squad, but her inability to express herself showed she perhaps suffered from a lack of self respect and colored her opinion of others."
"This was an odd book in that at times it completely engrossed me and at others, I had to do some serious skimming. There was so much redundancy about the case against Rory. About midway through, the author should have cut out about 40-50 pages. Fortunately, the pace and my interest picked up again and the book became exciting and suspenseful. In spite of that large flaw, I really enjoyed the read."
"the 6th in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Only female detective in murder squad is paranoid that her coworkers are out to get her. A lot of whining. The case involves a young woman who is killed and who did it and why. Our detective is the lead detective. Intricate plot. Too slow to develop and if you get by the whining, it is a decent read. Not nearly as good as earlier books in the series."
"This wasn't my favorite Tana French book, but it was still really good. I love these kinds of stories, where you're trying to figure out what's going on along with the characters. I didn't expect the twist. For more thoughts on the book and a book-inspired recipe for Corned Beef and Cabbage Pizza, check out The Hungry Bookworm: https://hungry-bookworm.com/2017/02/0..."
"French's strength is building a character (maybe from her years as an actress). Each novel is a different voice. With this one, Antoinette Conway is so matter-of-fact there's no poetry in French's writing. The story still hops along but we don't get any lyricism in the writing until the last 30 pages or so. I'll read another of the series, and I like to see more about Moran and Conway. Just feel like overall, this was a weaker effort in the series."
I found the narrator to be insufferable at times. it was my least fave of the Dublin murder series thus far.
"The second Tana French I've read. I enjoyed it more than the first, the characters are well developed, although I found Conway's brand of paranoia and self conscious 'hardness' got old very quickly. My main issue is the detail/minutae that really slows down the plot, this could easily have lost 100-120 pages. But, then again, I skipped over those pages and carried on reading.

2.5 stars rounded up to 3"
"4.5 stars initially. Annoyed that the detectives still use ‘gay’ and ‘lezzer’ as pejoratives like a bunch of middle school kids who haven’t learned that those are real people whose existences they’re maligning, and I don’t care if it’s realistic to the way the Irish Garda acts, I don’t want that in my novels. That’s why I can’t give it a higher mark, even though everything else about this installment is pretty stellar."
"A little too bogged down, too much ""nitty,"" not enough ""gritty,"" but I still adore this series, and here ginger Moran especially. He can't hold a candle to Frank Mackey in Book 3, Faithful Place though. It remains to be seen whether any character of French's ever will, but that's a high bar indeed."
"3 leaning towards 2.5. I absolutely loved the first three books in this series. I felt like the characters were fantastic and really well written. But after Faithful Place, the Dublin Murder squad hasn't really grabbed me the same way. I was mostly annoyed by the first 3/4 of the book. Only towards the end did I feel like I began to really get a sense of the main character and the plot. "
Sorry to say this but this dragged for me. I've always liked French because of her characters but I think she gave short shrift here to Antoinette and to Steve. The back and forth with Breslin and McCann -meh. I guessed the end of this early on and therefore was more than a little annoyed at having spent the time.
"Perhaps I don't read enough mystery series to accept that one simply has to have little diversions thrown in early, before the heroine gets a whiff of the real case, but they seemed so blatant in this tale. Eventually the story comes together nicely and has a satisfying ending, but I don't think I will be running back to the Dublin Murder Squad. "
"A bit of a let-down. Lacks the terror element--the disorienting sense of an untraceable or hard-to-make-out source of fear--that, for me, made the other French novels distinctive. The Trespasser is a decent detective novel. There is a mystery to be solved. It has well-drawn, familiar (from French's other work) characters. Satisfying but not special. "
"I always get so excited when a new Tana French novel comes out, and then am usually a bit disappointed. This wasn't bad, just not as good as Into the Wood and The Likeness. Is it wrong that I still just want to find out Casey and Rob somehow got back together? After all these years and other characters, those are the only two I still care about. Sigh. "
"I love Tana French and all of her other books. She is an incredible writer, page turner stories and characters with depth. This one was disappointing in both its story line and characters. I just didn't care and it took me too long to finish. Plus I knew well before the character what happened. I'll read her next one but hopefully it's comparable to In the Woods or The Likeness. "
"All in all another great plot.
I wished Antionette was not such a 1 dimensional character. Her anger and defensiveness was tough to slug through and kept me from enjoying this book more. It seemed like she was a stretch for the author to get a handle on and in the end, she just couldn't add more subtly."
"I have loved every single Tana French book and could not wait for this installment of the DMS. That being said, this was my least favorite book in the series. I didn't feel the depth of the characters as much and very early on saw through the ""twist"". However, I undoubtedly love this author and will continue to read her books."
"This is my first Tana French book and came well recommended. I just couldn't get comfortable with Conway, the damaged, potty-mouthed, paranoid murder detective and her angry view of the detective team and people in general. Irish dialect didn't help. A well-plotted story, but sometimes I felt like I was slogging through quick sand. "
"Not my favorite Tana French book--the story just wasn't dark and twisty enough when it finally worked out. Yes, I was vaguely surprised by whodunit, but in more of a ""hum. Interesting"" way than with a gasp. I never could quite get into the nervous dark energy that she was trying to build up in the book."
"I'm trying Tana French's books again and they still don't land quite right for me. I enjoyed this but it felt long and the plot felt needlessly complicated for essentially a simple story. I want to love her work because so many people I admire think the Dublin Murder Squad books are wonderful. As it is, these may have to go into the category of things that are objectively good but not for me."
"Good story, but it dragged on and on with minutiae that just wasn't important. Antoinette was a whiney, paranoid b&$@h who needed to quit acting like an angst-ridden teenager. I liked another novel by this author so will read another; however, if this were my first Tana French book, that would not be the case."
"Usually, I love Tana French and can't put her books down until I've finished them, but this one was not as much of a page-turner. The story dragged in the middle and I was also a bit disappointed with the outcome. However, there were parts of the plot that included the typical surprise turns that I've come to expect from her books. "
"difficult read - really got tired of Antoninette's paranoria about the guys on the squad even tho it was all probably true - once she and Steve got it figured out it was pretty interesting, but it took a long time to get there - almost gave up and rarely ever do that. all in all - not nearly as good as her first books."
"I'm not sure how to rate this book- It was good in the end, but only because I am a big Tana French fan did I make it far enough to get to the good part. I felt like her last book had a slow beginning, but this one was even slower. I enjoyed it but it didn't have the ""can't put it down"" quality that I love in her writing. "
"Really didn't like Conway as narrator for about 85% of the book; too defensive, conspiracy-theoried up. But I guess that plays into the themes of the book. This was by far the tidiest of endings French has created, which left me with a sense of relief - although I haven't minded the tangled knots of endings that came before. "
I didn't realize this was a series and I think I may have enjoyed it more if I had read the other books asI would have been in tune with the characters. This does stand alone though and was quite enjoyable. There were a lot of details to follow but it wrapped up being a smart mystery read. The audio version has a great Irish brogue that keeps you in the moment for location.
"Overall, it was a good mystery. I loved The Secret Place and In The Woods, but this one just didn't really impress me as much. It was written well, and Antoinette's paranoia was interesting to follow. However, the twist just wasn't as dramatic as I expected and there were very little action. It was good, just not as great as I had hoped."
"3.5 stars.
Not my favorite Tana French novel, but definitely still a fun read. A young woman is murdered and the lead detective on the case is a woman who is not necessarily well liked by her squad due to underlying sexism and racism.
Decent mystery, good story, some frustrating plot points, but all around a decent read."
"Although interesting, it was hard to get past the strange slang used by the main character - something from Ireland - and that really tripped me up and slowed down my reading. I found the main character's attitude annoying, with her constant hatred of everyone and her forced effort to display just how independent she was. Not my favorite."
"This installment of the gritty Dublin Murder Squad series follows Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Stephan Moran as they investigate what looks like a murder following a domestic dispute, but actually turns out to be full of secrets and a cover-up. Page-turner and the ending was better than I expected.

Adult"
"Tana French is one of my favorite authors, and I couldn't wait to read her latest. Unfortunately, for me, it was very slow going. In the end, the story is as good as anything else she's written but it took to long for me to become invested. I actually read two other books while trying to finish this one. I hope it's not the beginning of the end with her."
"Really did not like Antroinett. She has such a persecution complex and believes EVERYONE is just out to undermine her. Too much f--- talk, doesn't add a thing to the plot. In the end she and her partner determine that a fellow murder detective is the killer of his rejected lover. Tho Tana French is a well noted author, not sure if I'll read her again--at least not this series.."
"I liked it. Slow start. Antoinette isn't one that is easy to like and this book spent a lot of time in the interview room as opposed to gathering evidence with some uneven results. Mostly the dialogue there was crisp and fairly on point. The story hit its stride around midway and there was definitely a section that was packed with momentum. Still, not the strongest of the DMS series."
"This book started really slow for me. I ended up getting hooked in the last ~150 pages (of a 450 page novel), and am glad that I read it, but it took me a long time to get through the first 250-300 pages. I would give the last 150 pages a 4 star rating.

I am still interested in reading Tana's other books though!"
"Guess I forgot to write this one up during my ""lie on the couch and do nothing for all of the Thanksgiving break"" (it was glorious). Anyway, Tana French is always reliably a good read. I kept feeling tense because I don't like watching characters screw things up for themselves for no apparent reason, but it worked out ok. This one is mainly about the partnership and not the mystery itself."
"Overall, this is a decent read. However, I might have expected too much from this book given all the hype surrounding it (or perhaps I'm just not one for police procedurals.) I just found it to be a little too dense and drawn out for me to love it. I did enjoy the character development, though. I'll give Tana French one more try (this is the first book of hers that I've read.)"
"Wow--the interview scenes in this audiobook take FOREVER. And I mean, FOREVER. I loved the Irish accents, and the plot was good, but, oh, the talking in the interview rooms! 18 CDs meant that I was changing CDs during the same freaking interview and it just took too long. Tighter editing would have helped during the slow parts, I think. "
l always enjoy Tana French writting and this didn't dissapoint. There was no supernatural element which was welcome. There was more exploration of working relationships than gripping suspense. The main character Antoinette was a real hard woman and pretty intimidating who had little sympathy for the murder victim. it's an interesting and enjoyable read check it out.
"I have loved every book in this series... until now. But this book was about 100 pages of story wrapped into about 450 pages of book. I found the first two thirds to be overly long and boring with the vast majority of the actual plot happening in the last third.
This wasn't my favorite book in the series but I still happily look forward to the next one."
Reasonably good but not nearly as good as In the Woods or Faithful Place
"I liked the mystery aspect of the book but I did not like Conway's character. She whined, pouted, and over thought everything. She was annoying and had nothing that was likable. If you can look past her character, the story is good to read."
"Not as good as some of the previous books - got whiplash trying to keep up with the various theories, also a much darker mood"
"I started this book based on a King County library ""if-you-liked-this-then-you-might-like"" recommendation. I have good hopes for it.

I liked the characters in this book, but I found the twists and turns in the plot a bit unrealistic. The bet part was the look into contemporary Irish working class culture."
If this had not of been a book club read I would have put it down in the first couple hundred pages. It started off slow and laborious and Antoinette was not growing on me but I am glad I stuck with it as by the end I did enjoy it and can see the brilliance in Tana French's writing. Will I read another of her books? Probably not but walk away not regretting my day spent in her grasp. 
A young woman is found murdered in her home and it’s up to Detective Antoinette Conway to solve it although her entire squad seems to be out to get her for being a woman. She investigates the crime while trying to piece together why she was given this crime to investigate and how it might be connected to the police department in general. Pretty entertaining.
"It's always hard to write a review about a book that's part of a series you already enjoy. I always appreciate French's atypical but completely believable characters, and the plots are complicated enough to keep me hooked. This book didn't disappoint on either score. I'm sorry it's apparently the last one in the series. "
"A page-turner that contains three parallel streams: the crime, Antoinette and her colleagues and Antoinette and her father, so it's interesting to find out what happens in all three - for this it would deserve 5 stars -BUTIn the crime story there is one thing that in my opinion is impossible (he should have remembered the name), that's why - 2 stars."
"I just felt kind of disappointed by this one! For me, it just didn't have the twisty weirdness I love so much in the rest of the series. But, since it's Tana French, it's obviously still a solid read."
"3 1/2 Stars: I wanted to like this book and, in parts, I did. Crisp and vivid writing; twists and turns in the plot; and elements that were surprising. However, I just didn't like the characters and couldn't get past that. Disappointing read, as it could have been better. "
"Not Tana French's best. The writing is a bit heavy, the story doesn't get really interesting until a bit into the book and you'll figure out the story pretty early on. Fans will still like it. interesting theme about the stories we tell ourselves."
"I usually enjoy this author, however this book's main character is awful. She spends way to much time whining about how she is treated on the squad. It was annoying and got in the way of a good story "
"I am probably coming in at the low end of the rating scale on ""The Trespasser"" not because I didn't like it, but because I've come to expect a lot from a Tana French mystery. And this one just didn't pull me in as much as some of the others have."
"This mystery is part of a series set in Dublin, Ireland. Detective Antoinette Conway must try to solve a murder while dealing with her chauvinist fellow detectives. As the only woman detective in the department it is a daily challenge."
"Not my favorite in the series, but not as bad as the last one. The first half dragged on, and the second half moved really quickly- I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. It was a satisfying finish, and I've grown to like Antionette Conway and Moran's chemistry more. "
"Not her best by far, but it got a little better around the last fourth of the book. Not at all fond of the main character - she was a bit ""overdone"" to say the least. I loved her previous books and will continue to read anything new she publishes."
"Boilerplate

The protagonist here is so full of loathing that I really disliked her. On top of that, the plot is just implausible and kind of ridiculous. Plus the book is way too long.
I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them but this one falls short."
"I love Tana French. She is so good at building atmosphere and depth of character with her lyrical prose, while producing a sound story. This is a good procedural, but it's missing a lot of the elements of her previous efforts. I was disappointed and considered giving it 2 stars."
"Fun Read-Until the End

I enjoy Tana French in general, but this wasn't her best. The story line nor the characters were believable. While I thought she was going to redeem herself in the end, she instead wrapped it up with a neat little bow."
"This was good, but I have read much better by Tana French. The ending was pretty anti-climactic and Antoinette's personal story was not as developed as we usually see from French. I still enjoyed it and read it quickly, but I have enjoyed her other books a lot more."
"Another solid book in the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. I must admit that there were portions of this book that felt similar to parts of her other books. I really like the characters that I've met in these books. I will continue you on with her books.

"
"I sooo looked forward to this book and I was so disappointed. It drags on and on and moves very slowly. Our heroine, Conway, is not very likable, I couldn't make myself root for her, even when she's been treated badly. I hope the next book is better. "
"More difficult to read than Tana French's earlier books, but eventually liked it enough for three stars. Always anxious to return and read on ~ my favorites are still #1 and #2. Looking forward to the next one...do you think with Steve as main character?"
"I seek out Tana French's mysteries and always get swept up in the twists and turns. This one was not my favorite. I thought it began very slowly, almost tediously, But about half way through it gained momentum as a police procedural and I raced through the last 200 or so pages."
"3.5 stars. Not as literary as her other books and frankly, a bit drawn out. Had to fight the temptation to skim the last 50 pages or so. Not my favorite nor least favorite of her books, a page-turner for the most part."
"I was very disappointed with the main mystery - I guessed the killer almost 20 pages in, but this book was engaging, and adequately distracted me from the utter horror of the 2016 US election results, so 4 stars for that! "
"This felt like a straight up police procedural, much more so than her others. While there is nothing wrong with that, it also caught my interest less. If a day went by without me picking up the book, I didn't feel like I was missing anything."
"I liked this book much better than I like The Secret Place. It was smart, and had no loose ends. The part about organized crime seem unnecessary and a stretch though. And Moran seemed so much more naïve and ineffectual than he did in The Secret Place. But still enjoyed it."
"Tana French is a master craftsman and Antoinette is a gritty, driven heroine, but this novel required a lot of time and energy for a pretty small payoff. The resolution was so painfully obvious, you wonder if it was worth the wait."
"Not as good as her previous books in this series. Too much time spent on the personal issues the lead detective had, which gave the story a depressing feeling. The story did not get really interesting until 75% through. It did however come to a satisfying resolution."
"Another unique Dublin Murder Squad mystery. I didn't like this as much as others, mainly because the protagonist was on the obnoxious end. Once I got into the story, though, I enjoyed it and finished it quickly."
"I still love French and will read any of her novels but this one was a tangle because I genuinely disliked the protagonist. Also - not as tangled a web which is something I enjoy. In the end, I'd have leaned closer to 4 stars had I felt a thing for the main D. "
"I was so looking forward to this one but felt rather disappointed by it. It had a lot of internal office politics and a small cast of suspects, so the plot seemed weighed down a bit. I didn't find the characters as intriguing as in her previous books. My reading pace picked up toward the end."
"This was a slow book to get into. Part of the story seemed almost hard to grasp and the ideas that the main characters came up with were rather random. It finally came together near the end, but it took a while. "
"Police procedural to the max - Irish detectives, that is - and fiercely feminist, with a wry look at the possible downside of that. Interesting characters, characters who shape the world in their own story creations."
"Excellent, did not disappoint. Fast-paced consistently from start to finish. Interesting Irish colloquialisms, but some coarse language at times seemed overdone. Good descriptions of detective procedures in solving a crime. I look forward to the next novel by this author."
"I wanted to see how it ended, but I wasn't enamored of this book. It seemed to stretch too much, and the main character seemed a little too whiny for a detective - even though she eventually realized it herself."
"Looking at all the 5 stars I'm obviously in the minority but after 300 pages of back and forth interrogation, multiple motive theories and father issues I just wanted the book to end but it goes on for 150 more.
I think French is a marvelous writer but this one is not my favorite."
"Tana French has been steadily going downhill since about her third book. This one was disappointing. It just plodded along and had not alot to it whatsoever.
You can skip reading it."
"Compelling but the characters are difficult to like. Well, OK, impossible to like. In the next book, I hope to find out the main character is in therapy and the squad has been sent to remedial sensitivity training. "
"Predictable

Ok story, well written. The plot was obvious and the lone woman detective against her team became tedious. Glad if was resolved in the end do that if I read another I won't have her angst again!"
"I've read all of Tana French's books, yet found this one to be so-so. I felt that too much time was spent inside the character's heads. A single police interview with a suspect would go on for 40+ pages. Too many details slowed down the pace of the novel. "
Not her best book as it took almost 200 pages for me to get into it. A young woman is found dead in her house and the lead female detective and her male associate are called into the case. Very slow build and way too long. Good ending just don't know if it was worth it. 
"I didn't love this one quite as much as the others. The main character, Antoinette Conway, seemed one dimensional and cliche. The plot was original and intriguing, however and if you are looking for a solid police procedural this is a good read. "
"This is the second Tana French book I have read. I enjoy her books and I would recommend them, but once I finish a book there isn't anything to compel me to reminisce or any compulsion to reread any parts. It is like taking a nice bath, relaxing, but when it's over you move on."
"*3.5*
i think i'm not really a thriller person. even when they're well done and you can't put them down, they're still not really enjoyable to read. but i liked the characters and the ireland-ness of it, so i might give tana french another shot."
"Tana French is the author of quite a few murderous romps.

My mind was unable to occupy her creative space the first time I attempted to read this, so very glad that I gave it another shot!

"
"I did enjoy the story. I thought it was a little to long. I didn't get really into it until about 2/3 of the way of the book. The pace picked up and it started to flow better. I liked the two main detectives and their relationship. Overall, it was a pretty good book. "
"Irish mystery story. I had trouble identifying with the protagonist, but nonetheless this was a page turner. Even though I didn't think I was liking it that much, I did miss my stop twice while reading, so that says something! "
"Mediocre

First Tana French book to read.... It's quite slow for the first 60% and then it gets really good, ends on a great twist. A lot of the dialogue goes on too long for me and found it hard to identify any redeeming qualities in the main character."
"This was my first time reading Tana French. I feel like I am about to say something blasphemous, since I've only heard good things about her work, but I wasn't blown away by it like I expected. I think I picked the wrong book to start with out of the series..."
"I love Tana French and always anxiously await the next book. For some reason, this one just fell flat for me. I never really connected with the main character, and the mystery itself just didn't really grab me. I have loved all of her other books, so I will just chalk this one up to a fluke."
"The first half is a slog, complete with some obvious macguffins & an unhealthy dose of hard-to-stomach self-loathing from our narrator, but the story turns, the plot picks up, and the last half--& the ending--were very satisfying. "
"I enjoy Tana French's mysteries. The killer isn't obvious, but also not a complete surprise. The detectives, who aren't the same in every novel (if I'm remembering correctly), are always compelling characters."
"2.5 stars. Had to push through to finish this one, only because i bought it. I did appreciate the strong writing and I wanted to find out what happened. Did not like characters or police procedure. "
"This book is what result in taking one episode of Law and Order and turning it into a season long roller coaster. It's not that I hated it, it's just that some parts dragged on so incredibly long, it was hard to enjoy all of it. "
"Listened to Trespasser. Almost stopped because I need English ""subtitles"", had to look up Irish slang and it was very spiteful and angry. Stuck with it though and I am glad. Lots of emotions swirling around and in the end it was a reasonable conclusion. Could have been a bit shorter."
"Very detailed police procedural. Rookie detectives of the Murder Squad must solve a murder of a
young girl that leads them back to one of their own. A sharp insight into the workings of the
police department and how they are able to make the ""facts"" fit a variety of scenarios."
I didn't like this one as much as I have liked the books in the past. I had figured out who did it and it seemed to drag to the end about catching the guy. it felt forced and a little laggy. Still enjoyed the book.. but not as much as her other ones.
"I didn't enjoy this protagonist as much as others in the series, but it was still a good read. I think it suffered from being a slow read for me. If I had had longer chunks of time to read, I probably would have liked it better."
"I thoroughly enjoyed all of Tana French's other books and thought this one was just not worthy of her talents -- wildly improbably plot, thoroughly unsympathetic protaganist, waaaay too much time spent on internal police department politics. "
"This book was too chatty for my tastes - lots of long conversations and inner monologues. The first half of the book had a lot of office politics and not much detective work, also not to my tastes. The last part of the book sticks to main plot, though, with a satisfying conclusion."
"I really like Tana French, but this one wasn't quite as good as the others. Those had me on the edge of my chair with twists and turns, and this one was a much more straightforward, even plodding, procedural. "
"Didn’t enjoy quite as much as her others.

I think maybe the oddities of the expressions and language threw me off. I found myself losing interest many times. But she is a very good writer."
"I enjoy French's Dublin detective novels but they're starting to get a little repetitive. In this one, Detectives Steve Moran and Antoinette Conway get a case that looks like routine domestic violence but of course, turns out to be more complicated. In the Woods is by far, French's best book."
"Blah. Two and a half stars, max. Boring. Didn't feel anything for any of the characters (positive or particularly negative). First featured D (detective) who didn't interest me. Antoinette Conway struck me as paranoid and petulant -- and she let those qualities affect her performance."
"So far my favorite Tana French detective/narrator and my least favorite central story. I love French’s visceral style and this bristly, cold and unapologetic detective tugged my heart strings but the plot was just ok for me. "
I have read every book in the Murder Squad series and they never disappoint. She always manages to keep me guessing until the end. I often figure out the ending of books before I get there but that hasn't happened yet so I will continue to read her books. 
"Antoinette is a little too hard-nosed for me. That chip of her shoulder certainly did not help her situation with her co-workers. She even gave her partner too-hard-a-time. I enjoyed the story line though. Is there a follow-up book, because I am curious about the father?"
"I don't understand why this book has such high ratings. I almost put it down a few times but did manage to finish it. The ending was well done and I could have skipped through half the book and still got the story.
I found Antoinette to be quite tiring."
A long convoluted mystery. Interesting characters and plot. Lots of twists and turns and not totally surprised at the ending. Not sure about the happily ever after at the end of the book. This was a long one.
I love Tana however this one I had to go with three stars. I just couldn’t connect with the main character in the same way I usually do. I found parts of it too unbelievable. Still the writing and mystery kept me somewhat enthralled in the way her writing usually does.
"YES.

So fucking excited."
"I read the galley of this novel
I enjoyed the book and her writing; however, this mystery left me a little disappointed."
The Dublin Murder Squad apparently changes detectives pretty often.
I can't work out whether I saw that one coming or not
My least favorite from this series. The story could have been told in half the length.
This is number six. I passed on the last one. So 4 out of 6. This is my least favorite. No bad-just my least favorite. 
"Liked the mystery and the conclusion but, good god, Antoinette Conway is an incredibly unlikeable protagonist. "
"Not my favorite of French's ""Murder Squad"" series. Ultimately, so depressing in the end."
"Kind of a disappointment, after such a long wait."
Crime solving novel that takes place in Dublin. Good ending. A little too long getting there. 
I wasn't as into it as much as her others 
Unfortunately not as great as the previous ones....
 3.5
"Classic French, satisfying in all the right places. Not satisfying? The way your newborn knows you are right. At. The. Plot. Twist. I swear it took me 24 hours to get through the last 50 pages. "
"Ag, this felt sadly flat to me."
Was this about solving a murder or about exploring the minutiae of Antoinette's experience with the bullies in the police station? 
"On and on about detective head games and the protagonist's inferiority complex. If you're into intra-squad politics, this is your kind of murder mystery."
Tana French. What more can I say?
3+
I just thought this psychological thriller was just OK. I didn't bond with any characters except for Antoinette. To me it was a take it or leave it book. 
"This one took me FOREVER to finish. It was not bad, but it was just not enough to make me want to turn page after page. The ending was very well done though."
Loved the story and the characters. Just didn't like how many times she goes off on a long winded tangent. 
"I didn't enjoy this book as much as Tana French's other novels. I felt that Antoinette Crowley, the protagonist whined throughout the entire story."
"Not her best, but good."
"I feel awful that I didn't like this book when I loved her others. I couldn't get into it at all; however, this won't stop me from reading her next. "
"Not my favorite. Took a while to get going. I was impatient with what I usually love about French's books--the long, convoluted storylines. So might me just me. Still good. "
My only reservation with this book is that it was much too long. The narrative dragged during the first half: I nearly gave up.
"I'm a Tana French fan, although this story wasn't as interesting as others of hers I have read. Still, it has enough going on to hold a reader's attention. It did mine."
"I do like her writing. Only 3 stars though, because the main character was so unlikable for most of the book. It wasn't until the end that she actually started thinking and acting decently."
Predicted the ending... I never like that 
"Eh, not one of French's best. "
"3.5 stars. Just like The Secret Place, this book could have been about 100 pages shorter."
3.5 actually. I thought it dragged a bit but did enjoy it.
Just not as entertaining as the others in the series.
"She has been one of my go to authors for mystery/detective, but this one was not as complex and polished as the others."
Kind of disappointed. 
I didn't enjoy this one as much as her others. 
"It's Tana French, so it's good, but it's not her best. Hard to follow up The Secret Place, though."
Brilliant ending made up for distracting details and plot points.
"Not a fan of her latest but her earlier novels were stunning

"
Didn't like as much as her previous books.
"I have read and enjoyed each of Tana French's novels, but I just did not care for this one as much as the others. It felt slow as molasses and about 100 pages too long. "
I didn't like this one as much as her other ones although it was very well done and worth reading. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
[Irish murder detective mired in gender harassment gets a tricky case involving a murdered young woman]
"Slow read, fast moving and interesting denouement."
Love tana French but this is my least favorite of hers. The story didn't really get started until the middle and it was pretty slow. 
"Ending was great as usual, so was the writing but I just was constantly annoyed with Conway's character, and had to force myself to push past her negativity."
Too much cop speak. Just ok. Enjoyed her earlier books more. 
"I am a big fan of Tana French, but not so much of this book. Whereas her past stories had a sense of place, this did not, and the squad room seemed claustrophobic."
"Murder mystery involving the police, in more ways than one. Solving the murder may not bring the lead detective the satisfaction she seeks and she needs to get out of her own head to survive."
I liked it. Just took a bit to get in to it. Look forward to hearing more about these characters....???
"Not my favorite of hers, but still a solid cop novel."
"Like other Tana French stories, this was suspenseful and had a few twists along the way. There wasn't much of a mystery, but the female detective's back story was interesting."
"Sigh, not here best. She went with a challenging main character and pulled that off quite well, but it drove too much of the story"
Better than her last. 
Not as good as her other books
"Bit of a convoluted plot that is not that believable and very heavy on slick dialogue and interrogations which I liked, but got somewhat tired of. But not bad."
"This book was slow. If you're a fan of cop-centered mysteries, you'll enjoy it. If not, it's a struggle. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read it again."
Took a while to get into as very dense pages. Quite different from this author's usual books. Not sure to be honest if I enjoyed it or just read it because I'd started it. 
Least likeable narrator of all time- actually no sympathetic characters at all.
Didn't care for the narrative voice for about 300 pages. 
Good mystery as always with French but the protagonist in this one was even harder to like than some of her others.
"Not one of my favorite Dublin Murder Squads. A cerebral rather than a visceral mystery. Keeps you guessing who feels how about whom, but the murder takes a backseat to the investigators themselves."
Not her best. I could have put it down at any time but I struggled though.
"I loved Tana French, but her last two books have been so-so."
Not the best book that I've read. 
Not as good as her earlier books. It took a while for the story to take off.
Another fun dectective read by Tana French. 
3.5. 
Love Tana French but I knew who had done it from the beginning... still a good read! When's the next one coming out? 
I didn't know...this book kept me reading and I suppose the premise of the story was good but...just not plausible. The conclusions that the detectives jumped to just didn't make sense.
A little hard to get through. Took a long time to go anywhere.
"It was OK-I will probably be the only human to be neutral with this book! The author did nor ""grab"" me into the story"
French's books are always a treat.
"I liked it, but I think it was too long. I felt like she could have gotten to the conclusion much sooner. "
Really slow start and bogged down in the middle. Read it because it's part of the series but it was difficult.
"It's my least favorite of French's books, but it's still her and I love her and this kept me occupied through a six hour flight."
"The first few books in this series were amazing, but the last 2 were just not that great. Long, drawn out, boring, predictable. "
"Not her best book. I found the main character so exhausting, and I found the plot incredibly unlikely "
Was good but did drag a bit
"Much too long, not very exciting and slow moving. But, if you have the time and patience, it's a good story."
"I found this to be a departure for French...the storyline was thin, the stakes were low, and the writing uninteresting. I was disappointed, to say the least, as I've loved many of her previous works."
Every series of books has a less than inspired book in the batch...this is that book 
"3.5 ⭐️ A little long for the content, love Tana French but not her usual standard "
A bit slow 
"3,5"
Another good book regarding the Murder Squad. French loves to get into the psyche of the officers and how they solve the crime. 
"Protagonist Antoinette Conway is annoying. That is the deliberate choice of the author. If one can put up with her paranoia, it is a tolerable read. Repetitious. "
"The female protaganist is compelling but the ""mystery"" really wasn't very surpising or interesting"
Probably 3.5. First Tana French that I have read.
It was okay. I think the main character annoyed me a bit which is why I maybe didn't like it as much as a previous book from this series.
"Interesting but not her best. way too long!100+ pages too long.
"
Long winded who dunnit that you can't figure out with the facts. Could have gotten to the point much quicker. Wanted a page turner and didn't find myself eager to get back to it.
"This one was a little harder to follow than the previous ones in the series, also, the main character was so unlikable it was difficult to get through."
It wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be after hearing everyone rave about it. 
Not as good as others in the series but still entertaining.
My least favorite in the series.
It was hard to get into. It had some great twists and turns but the ending fell flat for me. 
Very disappointing after her wonderful previous works. Not great.
Not my favorite of her books. 
I usually love her but this one was eh for me. Felt long 
Kind of a slow start but I eventually connected with the main character and the second half was suspenseful. 3.5
Started off really interested and then became a middle of the road detective novel.
Listened to the audiobook and the heavy Irish brogue of the reader and use of the vernacular were a distraction. Short on action but very long on detailed interrogations and psychological musings. 
"Crime fiction is so not my typical thing, and I picked this up on a lark. I'm glad I did though. I really enjoyed this and can't wait to experience more of the Dublin Murder Squad."
"the jacks = the bathroom, that's where the expression, 'you don't know jack shit' came from. I learned a lot of Irish slang from this one! "
"Very slow moving. Irish brogues, Irish police."
"It took me over one hundred pages to get into this book. The constant crude language got to me. when I finally did get into it, I was hooked. I found the end a bit non climactic."
It moved too slowly and was very wrapped up in the vernacular. The last 50 pages were good. 
"The detectives seemed to explore/chase a few too many theories. And, personally, I was disappointed in the ending."
Best langzaam en qua plot niet zo spannend. Maar: goed geschreven en interessant. ZEKER Niet de beste. 
"Normally a huge fan of Tana French. This book seemed much more simply written and seemed far to long. Good story, just not the usual level of prose I expect from Ms. French. "
I felt like the book dragged....so many words......
"I thought the book took a long time to actually become interesting. Too many pages of the same thing, I liked the murder case but took too long to form. "
I will give this 3 1/2 stars. It was a good story I just thought it could have been told in far fewer pages.
Great story. A bit contrived in parts but worth the read.
"I can understand why some people will rate it higher. It definitely had a palpable intensity, interesting characterization and added some Irish slang to my Vocabulary. "
"A solid 3 stars, but entertaining. Will I read another in the series? Probably."
Decent read but not fabulous. The crime isn't all that hard to solve - no big surprise or twist. 
good but dragged some. good finish
I really felt that it was bloated and there was too much padding around central plot which was good but should have been shorter for more enjoyment.
"Not what I was expecting, but still held my interest just enough to tough it out. I had trouble liking the main character and wayyyyyy too many f-bombs."
Not bad but not her best.
"I like Tana French's murder mysteries, they are often a little quirky. Trespasser was not my favorite, still a good read, I found it slow moving."
Audio - ok/good
"I liked it as much as her other books. This one, however, is a little different, since the whole book covers only three days."
"Not as gripping for me as earlier books in the ""Murder Squad"" series. I always enjoy the Irish slang."
"2.7
"
"I enjoy a police procedural, but the ending's psychological rationale was a bit of a stretch."
"A good read but lots and lots of detail, maybe too much."
read it before
"Not my favorite of French's mysteries, but a solid mystery read. Drags in the beginning half, but picks up full throttle in the last few hundred pages. "
"Solid procedural, like a BBC detective mini series I could read on my phone.

I laughed every time I read ‘Murder D.’"
DNF. Just couldn't connect with main character. Never got interested in story.
Lot of reading for an average crime plot.
"Another great Tana French novel, although the characters were a bit less than likable especially the lead detective."
Update 2023: I finished my re-read and now I'm all out of Dublin murder books. :( 
I always enjoy French's stories. She has an easy way about her writing. 
"Once I got over my aversion to the main characters victim mentality, and the first 300 pages, I really enjoyed the ending! "
"This wasn’t as good as Tana’s first book, (i sped ahead nearly 100 pages as it was really lagging), but the last 100 pages got good again."
"Almost a 3. Still love Tana French, but this was my least favorite of hers. The story dragged at times, many extraneous story lines that didn’t add to plot, and a few holes/non-plausible plot-points."
good police procedure crime solving read
"don't remember anything about this, just that I enjoyed speeding through it. I think Tana French's work has that quality of quiet enjoyment to it. A small break from reality - so a 3*?"
Was a good read . Love the unique language style. The mystery wasn't so mysterious.
I did not like it as much as her previous novels. The last half was better than the first.
Just didn't hold me as much as the previous books... :(
"3.5*
"
Good ending but it took 250 pages to get going. 
"I like the Tana French books, but this moved too slowly for me and ended up being predictable."
"I'm not a Tana French fan, but this is probably one of her better books. A female victim of what looks like a lover's quarrel, but the complications just keep things unsettled enough that the detectives on the case continue to look harder, resulting in yet more complications. Unfortunately, the intra-police department conflict and conspiracies -- which seem nowadays to be part of so many thrillers -- begin to make the story feel trite and overused. "
I wanted to like this book more than I did. A lot of cursing. 
#31/2017 .. I didn't completely guess the end but for most of the way there. I know this is fiction but the manipulation of the crime was appalling. 
"I was super excited about this book, liking all of Tana French's past book, but I was not into the protagonist - so much that it took me out of the story at times with pure annoyance. I just wanted to scream at her ""ugh, you are so vain - get over yourself - not everyone is ""out to get you"""". I felt bad for her partner (featured in previous book) that he had to pretty much walk on egg shells and turn her mood just to work, must be tiring. As the book was winding down, I was thinking, we've had a good run Tana, but this might be it for me - the ending happened and it sort of redeemed itself for me. I understand that the protagonists in these books are not necessarily likable, but I don't think I have wanted to quit one of the series before because of it."
"It was a good book, but I was waiting for the normal ""Tana French"" twist. It was completely obvious who the murderer was... the whole time. "
"Good plot, but tedious reading! Would have been fine at half the length. Really couldn't like the main character."
"My least favorite of French's Dublin Murder Squad stories, which I usually love. There is not one likable character in this story, which drags on at a very slow pace."
"Good, but........

Dana French is an excellent writer and she can keep your attention throughout. But this story a main character that is really scattered. There seemed to be a lot of superfluous stuff, and I found myself putting the book down a lot. In the end it was good, but it took so long to get there."
"I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. It's not as good as her early works, but better than The Secret Place. I hope her next one is as good as the first ones. Still, a fun, suspenseful read. "
"A woman is killed in her apartment. There's no sign of forced entry. She was in the midst of preparing for dinner, yet the stove was turned off. The main suspect doesn't seem guilty at all. The woman's friend isn't forthcoming with details.

Detective Antoinette Conway and her partner shared many great one-liners that had us laughing out loud.

I really enjoy Tana French's novels and her detailed character development. This is the first time I've listened to one of her books rather than reading a print copy. Because the audiobook was 19 hours, it was tedious at points and felt like it dragged on forever."
"I enjoyed this, but I always get a little sidetracked while reading Tana French novels because I can not picture the geography of the Dublin neighborhoods (back lanes, back walls, top of street). I also found this one a little heavy on dialogue. But the story is great and I read it very quickly."
A fun genre romp.
"Decent murder mystery. Lots of great dialogue, if overly long. Good reader."
Yikes. I think this is the worst in the series by a long way. The first half was almost unspeakably boring – seriously a two-star book – and the speculations seemed borderline preposterous. It was kind of redeemed in the back-end but mostly I wish I hadn’t bothered with it. Three stars is me being generous.
Took a long time to get into this book. I picked it up and set it back down several times. I was over 300 pages in before I got hooked and really wanted to keep going. 
"I love Tana French and this book was worthy of 3.5 stars. I found it a bit slower reading than her others.
"
"I enjoyed it, but it really seemed to lag in the middle. It was a bit difficult to keep reading it, but I'm glad I did. "
"3.8***
I have loved Tana French's mysteries replete with psychological intrigue and her latest book did not disappoint. Antoinette Conway does not have the sympathy of her squad, so when she considers other suspects rather than the bookstore-owning boyfriend of the young woman murder victim, she becomes the target of ridicule. Luckily Antoinette has an innate compulsion to delve deep to understand human motivation resulting in a compelling case wrap up."
"My rating is probably closer to 3.5.
Conway grew up with no father, and she has a pretty tough shell to deal with being an outsider: biracial in Ireland, tall and strong instead of blond and petite, willing to get in your face instead of playing polite.

These things help and hinder her job in the Garda, but the level of banal persecution she's dealing with on the murder squad is affecting her relationships with everyone and her ability to see clearly.

She and her partner get handed what seems to be a basic domestic, but this murder might not be what it looks like.

French is a master of deep character development and this story of the murder squad is no different. Conway is actually difficult to cheer for sometimes, but it's also interesting to wonder if she's any more broken/stupidly aggressive than the numerous broken but effective male detectives we read about across the genre.

Women's roles are also a big part of the story we uncover about the victim, though this is harder to talk about without spoilers. But there is lots of commentary to unpack in what motivates this character, how she tries to take back power, and how/why she doesn't succeed.

There's a few other Murder Squad novels that I liked better, for whatever reason, but this was still a good read."
"Tana French is a terrific writer. Her recent work shows technical and stylistic maturation; mechanically it’s superior to her award-winning debut, Into the Woods. I quite enjoyed The Trespasser. The dialogue was sharp and the characters interesting. It’s a pleasure to visit the gritty Dublin (as well as the other Irish cities and regions) TF brings to life.
The Trespasser’s core mystery was not, in my view, compelling. This book’s plot is weaker than TF’s best works, specifically Faithful Place and Broken Harbour. Consequently, The Trespasser lacks the emotional punch TF can sometimes deliver. I would not call it her worst book, although it ranks a hair below The Secret Place in my estimation. Of course, because TF is such a gifted artist, even her worst (published) effort offers a decent read."
"The murder victim's (pre-mortem) motivation and actions, which bring on her death, are so elaborate and far-fetched, that the author has to have the best friend recite it all in a multipage interview with the detective on the case. There was no way to weave that whopper into the plot.

Despite the necessary suspension of disbelief, this was an entertaining installment in the Dublin Murder Squad series."
"A bit too long and an open ending (another book?). That being said, I still liked it. "
"I liked the overall storyline of this book, but it felt like it really needed some editing. It dragged on in multiple instances, with conversations between characters going on much longer and in more detail than necessary. "
"Tana French drives me nuts. Her writing is excellent (maybe sometimes overdone for the genre, but that's okay) and plotting riveting, but her characters! I hate her characters. Not sympathetic, unkind, and unpleasant to be around. In the middle of this book, I was thinking I'll give it one more book and if I loathe the narrator, that'll be the last. By the end of the book, Antoinette is a tiny bit more bearable, but the concluding plot definitely has me wanting more. "
Another solid entry in this series. Conway as a narrator bums me out a little--she's so angry all the time--but it's a good mystery and I hope we hear about her again in the future.
3.5 *
Not sure if I was just impatient but found it was a little too detailed or ramble some. 3 1/2 stars
"Ok story, premise was a bit unbelievable."
"A murder that appears to be open and shut holds surprise and considerable complication for Detectives Conway and Moran. Unlike French's last book (The Secret Place) there's only one point of view here: Conway's. That's a mixed blessing - The Trespasser has more narrative energy - but Conway's need to see herself as put-upon by her colleagues grows tiresome, not to mention Moran's habit of making up theories out of whole cloth. Still, French has a design in mind for this book. It's a novel about self-delusion, and the things that might at first be irritations are paid off. On balance I enjoyed this slightly more than The Secret Place but In The Woods is still my favorite French. "
"This one just seemed to drag a bit. Love the reader, tho. I hear all my books with an Irish brogue for days afterward!"
"a good long read, with enough of a mystery to keep you reading. however the repetitive dialogue got on my nerves after awhile, and i'm not sure i cared quite enough about the main character to want to root for her - or understand really why her co-workers teased/hated her so much. pretty relentless read, and not always in a good way. "
"This was the only book of the series I had trouble getting through. It's well written, a great mystery-but I just couldn't connect with Antoinette Conway."
"3.5 stars

I love a good police procedural, but this one depressed me with all the internal monologue about how everyone hated her (the protagonist), with all the paranoia. I guess that means it's good writing, that it can make me feel so heavy just reading about the protagonist's problems, but honestly, it wore me out. It made me dread picking it up again, but I wanted to finish it because it's a good story. Heavy, but good. But also a bit predictable."
This was pretty entertaining but nothing particularly exciting. 3.5
I reviewed this book here: https://turnthepagelisa.com/2017/04/2...
"The story was a four star story, but things kind of dragged on and got into a weird ""maybe this happened, oh no it went like this, no you were right the first time"" pattern. I get that this was part of the character development, but I guess I just wanted it to be more of a tightly wound who-done-it."
Listened to this book at 2x speed just to get it over with...tough cop Antoinette Conway came across like a bulldog looking to bite. Everyone.
Conway and Moran are handed a case that has the hallmark of a domestic situation when a young woman is found dead in her own house. The story unfolds over a span of a few days but it was evident early in the book that all was not as it seemed and became frustrating when the duo failed to see what appeared to be obvious and followed scenarios that did not fit the situation. This left me frustrated and wanting to throw the book into the salvage sack. Police corruption and poor supervision lie at the heart of the matter. See how it leaves the ficticious murder squad. I ended with 3 stars but it could even have dropped to 2.
"SPOILER ALERT: There was something missing from this book. French's previous books involving the Dublin Murder Squad had such lovely, mysterious and eerie twists and turns. This one just didn't have the same depth. True, French does delve into the Squad's personalities, Conway and Moran, in particular. However, I grew tired of Conway's constant defensiveness and bitter take on her colleagues. I would have cut at least 50% of that part of the plot. It didn't serve the plot well and was frankly distracting. The murder itself was rather mundane. Sorry, I like murder mysteries that shock the living daylights. French's decision to focus on the psychological aspect of the victim might have been more powerful if the motive fit the crime. Just didn't do it for me. I'm also not buying that the perp did not recognize the victim right from the get-go. He had to know it was the daughter of Des Murray. I kept flipping back in the pages to see if I'd missed that part. This fact ruined it a bit for me. I'm still a big fan of French, though. I know she'll come up with something amazing next time."
It didn't keep my attention the way I thought it would. I struggled a bit to finish which is unusual for me.
"I listened to the audiobook from the library. This one was okay. It had an intricate plot, but everyone was whiny. Murder mystery with a complaining main character. "
"I really liked the witty writing, but the mystery itself was kind of ""meh."" "
"Weakest of her six.
Still ok."
"For most of this book I felt I was just plodding along, it went very slowly, probably just like a murder investigation seems to the detectives. There is a lot of space given to the suspect interviews, which was interesting, but tedious and repetitive - just like interviews probably are. I stuck with it till the end because the plot was good, and I'm glad I did."
"I didn't realize it was a series, but easy enough to follow without having read the others."
Felt a lot slower than her previous books.
Irish who dun it. Densely ladened with theories & suspects. Overlay of the protagonist who is feeling the annoyance of her peers and her partner who wants to be on her side but finds it difficult at times. Interesting & compelling but not a homerun with me.
"An ok story, but not her best. I was a bit disappointed to be honest. The ""big reveal"" was so obvious I had guessed it by the third chapter. Seemed odd these detectives didn't catch wise until almost the very end. The main character was a bit pig headed and self absorbed, so maybe that shouldn't be such a surprise."
3.5 slow start
Meh
"Liked the characters, liked the intro of the case, liked the ending. Didn't like the long, repetitive series of interrogations in the middle. A good author, but this was not a favorite."
"I'm as distraught as I expected to be after finishing The Trespasser by Tana French. I read as slow as I could, as it is currently the last book in her Dublin Murder Squad series. This episode had plenty of twists & turns, as have all past volumes. If you like mystery/thrillers I cannot recommend this series enough!!!"
fair
"Somewhat of a slow read for me, but interesting story line. "
Intricate and intriguing mystery. Wordiness and often overly cute dialogue slows down pace.
"This must be one of the books that didn’t show up in my READ folder last year due to some glitch. That I’ve lost track of books I’ve read disappoints me, but hopefully I can fill them in when I randomly happen upon the titles a second time. All I remember from this book is a feeling of being let down, as it was not quite on par with the excellence of the first five in the series. "
Way too long and I like long books.
"This was a hard book to read. I read it as part of a reading club. It seemed to go on and on. It was much too long of a book. I did enjoy learning the English jargon. I did enjoy reading the insightful characteristics of the inner workings of a detective investigation and what it was like to be a woman amongst men. There was a plot that did pane out, but it took way too long to get to the end."
